Grass is painted in a black ink that flows with lavish details of the beautiful fields and farmland of Korea and uses heavy brushwork on the somber interiors of Lee's memories.

The cartoonist Gendry-Kim's interviews with Lee become an integral part of Grass, forming the heart and architecture of this powerful nonfiction graphic novel and offering a holistic view of how Lee's wartime suffering changed her. Grass is a landmark graphic novel that makes personal the desperate cost of war and the importance of peace.

While Yoohyun immediately awakens as a superpowered S-rank hunter that few can challenge, Yujin must go to extra lengths to achieve his own awakening. Even so, he is met with disappointment when his rank is revealed to be F, rendering him practically the same as a regular person.

When a terrible tragedy gives him the opportunity to have a wish granted, Yujin simply chooses to return to a happier time. Memories intact, Yujin's only thought is to reconcile with Yoohyun. He does not expect to undergo a second awakening and, what is more, possess different skills than before. Although he may still be an F-rank, Yujin is thankful just to be able to live peacefully with his brother. However, Yujin soon finds himself entangled with an ever-growing number of high-class individuals whom he is in a unique position to support.

Meanwhile, Lee Ji-u is incredibly frustrated by the game; although he spends a fortune on a sword, nobody seems to want him in their party—they berate his inexperience and shabby equipment. However, his spirits are lifted when Luna invites him to join her party. The two seem to get along well until they arrive deep in the forest, where Luna kills and ridicules Ji-u.

Distraught and dejected, Ji-u tries to upgrade his items, only for them to be destroyed by unsuccessful reinforcement attempts. A passing newbie sympathetically gives Ji-u a wooden stick, which he also reinforces—however, by some miracle, the stick does not break and reaches the game's maximum level of +99. With a single tap on the ground, the stick rips the continent in half, breaking the world record for players killed in an instant.

From his belittled, depressed beginnings, Ji-u becomes one of Chrono Life's most powerful players—his feats changing his life and the game forever.

Dorothy, who’s just a regular middle school girl, has a drastic change in her dreams when one day she runs into Mistress Lilly, an accomplished witch who is looking for an apprentice. Sure, some girls would want to become a witch so that they could learn to make love potions, or own magical cats and rabbits that talk… but where’s the fun in that? Our cute heroine would answer this question by replying : “I’d want to become a witch to live out a romantic life that every girl wishes for… you know, like turning the world into a dark hellish cauldron, making everyone bow to me, and summoning cute zombies, tee hee hee~!”

Oh yes, and what kind of comedy would this be without having all the hyperactive crazy sub-characters that make the heroine seem like a senile old lady in comparison. First, you have Dorothy’s close friend Remi who doesn’t seem to understand you’re only supposed to take just 1 prozac pill a day. Then you have Lilly, the witch, who’s fashion sense would make Madonna and Britney Spears blush. And finally, we can’t forget about Dorothy’s main love interest, a cute boy who’s only problem is that he’s a werewolf who wants to eat her alive!

Forces are being deployed, and secret alliances are being made. Meanwhile, urban violence explodes onto the streets of Tokyo, and Hae-sung, the leader of a Korean-Japanese teenage mob, gets caught on camera by an NHK reporter as he murders a Yakuza boss.

Political tensions reach boiling point as the exposure of Korean concentration camps in Indonesia leads Korea to enter the war. Alliances between neighboring countries are forged as the world readies itself for a massive clash. In the midst of the chaos, Hae-sung must hide from the police and the Yakuza, both of whom want to find and execute him.

The ramifications of Korea's war against Japan are felt closer to home as Korean citizens living in Japan are branded as ""outsiders."" The tragedy of Auschwitz repeats itself as these people are forced to wear identifying armbands, are ostracized by the Japanese populace and forced into Korean ghettos. The segregation takes a turn for the worse as Koreans are herded onto trains and sent to war camps. All the while, Korean and Japanese armed forces wage all-out war against each other on land, sea and air.

The lucky ones, like Yusung and Uhmji, lose their jobs but are allowed to return home to the Oh family residence. With the fugitive Hae-Sung now in police custody, the Yakuza look to his family for revenge.

As a result, Kaze'aze was able to get close to the Queen and entice her with the ways of darkness. Kaze'aze blinded the Queen of Kanavan's eyes to truth and led her to wage a five-year war against the Serdin Kingdom. All of Bermesiah  Continent was devastated; many heroes fell in battle, and even the Queen of Serdin sacrificed her life in hopes of ending the fighting.

The death of the Queen of Serdin broke Kaze'aze's hold over the Queen of Kanavan, who, after finally regaining her senses, erupted with fury over Kaze'aze's treachery. Kaze'aze escaped before the Queen of Kanavan could execute her. This lead the Queen to dispatch Trackers to punish the Queen of Darkness. But after years of searching, she was nowhere to be found and the Queen's Trackers vanished as well; forcing the Queen of Kanavan to abandon her search.

The Serdin Kingdom experienced a series of bizarre incidents related to Kaze'aze after the Five-Year War: these events revealed that Kaze'aze manipulated the Kanavan and Serdin Kingdoms into fighting each other. The newly appointed Queen of Serdin is now determined to prevent Kaze'aze from starting another war between the two kingdoms for the sake of the entire continent. The Queen of Serdin has prepared to confront Kaze'aze and counter her evil plans by organizing Grand Chase, an elite corps that will fight for all of Bermesiah.

Pulled in every direction, she is forced to go on a quest to defeat the Demon King, forced to keep her heroic quest a secret, and forced to re-enroll at the academy she left behind years ago, making her a downright ""fossil"" compared to her peers. Still, anything is better than living with her cold-blooded sister, openly known to have killed her own brother and possibly their parents too. Or so Ashleigh thought until she realized both princes attending the academy were after her allegiance in their pursuit for the throne. Trapped under her murderous older sister's thumb and stuck between a sibling rivalry over the crown, Ashleigh can never seem to catch a break. In a twisted irony, how hard will Ashleigh Lute have to work to be able to live the easy life she's always wanted?

'Let's not be impudent, and be obedient.' I obstinately didn't need nor have the mindset of trying to be loved by the emperor. Although the male leads who were the concubines were giving me glances, I could just lie flat. Since it wasn't even a very difficult thing, I really did so. It was definitely like that, but—

And that gaze with which they looked at me as if I was the loveliest in the world was extremely uncomfortable. Just where would I use a fairy tale book that's full of jewels and silk, and the magic pearl which is the Imperial Family's heirloom?

Her mother and sister beg her to be a better student, sister, daughter; her beleaguered father expresses his concerns with his fists. Bad Friends is set in the 1990s in a South Korea torn between tradition and Western modernity and haunted by an air of generalized gloom. Cycles of abuse abound as the characters enact violence within their power structures: parents beat children, teachers beat students, older students beat younger students. But at each moment the duress verges on bleakness, Ancco pulls back with soft moments of friendship between Pearl and her best friend, Jeong-ae. What unfolds is a story of female friendship, a Ferrante-esque connection formed through youthful excess, malaise, and struggle that stays with the young women into adulthood.

Served by a dry and precise line, Bad Friends viscerally captures the adolescent years of two young women who want and know they deserve something different, but, ultimately, are unable to follow through. In a culture where young women are at a systemic disadvantage, Ancco creates a testimonial to female friendship as a powerful tool for survival. Pearl forgets her worst adolescent memories, but she cannot ever shake the memory of her friendship with Jeong-ae during her most tumultuous years.

Throwing mobility to the wind, you dull yourself with booze. The grown-ups around you are stunted by their own failures so they act out—with alcohol, too, sometimes with violence. What was once the hope of youth quickly spirals into powerlessness and malaise as the days trickle by. Ancco expertly renders the moment of suspension between the desire to grow up and the fear that accompanies it.

Autobiography blends with fiction in these coming-of-age stories about people reckoning with their place in their community and women coming to terms with other women. A boy living with HIV tries to decide how he's going to tell his parents—or whether he should tell them at all. A mother puts pressure on her daughter to pass her exams, and the stress drives them both to drink, fueling a toxic relationship with a lot of care just below the ugly surface. Another girl keeps getting bruises, but who's inflicting the damage—herself or a loved one? And dogs—seemingly the only ones capable of unconditional love—offer some reprieve.

In Nineteen, Ancco delivers a cutting panorama of contemporary Korean society that's much darker than one might expect, while also brimming with life and the vitality of youth.
