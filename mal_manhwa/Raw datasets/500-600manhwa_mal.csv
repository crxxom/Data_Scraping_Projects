Instead of going in hiding, however, Evan decides to hole up at his press office - not the safest place for a man in Evan's situation. Unwilling to have his star reporter remain so vulnerable to attack, the Editor-in-Chief orders Evan to cover an out-of-state story: ""real"" ghost sightings in a secluded village in the countryside—an article too absurd to be handled by the New York Times. For lack of a better thing to do, Evan decides to  follow his editor's orders and drives across the Midwestern desert searching for a town nobody seems to have heard of. After ten days of driving by sleepy rural villages with zero results, our lost and exhausted New Yorker is just about ready to give up.
