While my brother Cassian is struggling for the revenge of the family, it's my job to find and deal with the final villain that was not revealed even at the end of the original!! In order to do that, I must first enter the northern duke's castle, where the family's traitors are hiding. Somehow, I became an ""imprint companion"" of Duke Anais, a beast of a beast and a leading candidate for the final villain. Besides...

""Please kiss me now, Astel."" In order to live, you need to have daily skinship with your imprint companion. There was no such thing in the contents of the original story!

""'Shall we go see your favorite sea today?""
""I-I don't think I can. I decided to meet Sir Cassian today.""

The duke gritted his teeth with a cold face. I was slightly scared as I saw him. Maybe he's teething because he is a wild beast!

***

One day after I received the duke's favor and consideration, my older brother Cassian left his nephew for a while. However, the duke seems to have made a huge misunderstanding.

""It will become our child.""
""Huh...?""
""Cassian Gray will disappear from this world now, so you will not become his bride.""

Yes...? When did I become Cassian Gray's bride? We are relatives!

You would be tired of it too, especially if it was already your fourth time doing it. This time, I became Rosetta, the female lead's villainous older sister. Yet again, I was sure this life wouldn't be exciting either. I had led straightforward lives before, and then I died and moved on to the next. But why can I use the abilities I had in my second transmigration?

Alicia, this novel's protagonist, was fated to have a poor, emaciated life. However, considering that she was this novel's true heroine, I couldn't just let her roll through the mud like this. I would do everything in my power to change her fate. To achieve my goal through a project hereby dubbed as the [Mob-Alicia Project], I've recruited the male lead's older brother—Cassian Carter. He was the villain who was almost killed—no, was fated to be killed—by the male lead. ""If you want to live, promise me one thing."" As if he was a wild beast that had been hunted and left to die alone, he breathed with incredible difficulty. I reached toward the poor man's face and caressed his cheek, leaning down to whisper softly. ""If I save you..."" Lay down your own life on the line to protect my sister.

Huh, he is still going on about that? He was the one who said not to follow him in the first place. ""Everyone is mistaken about something. Mayerie is my exclusive maid. So get out of here.""
