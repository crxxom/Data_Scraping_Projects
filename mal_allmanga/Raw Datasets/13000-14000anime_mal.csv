On December 5, 1965, a U.S. aircraft carrier is en route from Vietnam to Yokosuka, Japan. While conducting training exercises 80 miles off Okinawa, an A4 strike aircraft is loaded with a B43 hydrogen bomb, but it falls overboard and sinks in 16,000 feet of water. Based on the true story of the USS Ticonderoga, which reached Japan two days later (on the anniversary of Pearl Harbor; nice touch). Neither side revealed the incident, nor that she was carrying atomic weapons in contravention of U.S. treaties with Japan. The plane, its pilot, and the bomb were never recovered, and the incident was only declassified in 1989, causing an outcry in Japan and resulting in this environmentally themed anime. The extra ""n"" in Ticonderonga may be a genuine error in transcription or an attempt to distance the story from real events, since the anime continues with Ashika, a boy from a Japanese fishing town, contacted by telepathic whales who bring him visions of fearful seamonsters. Then again, if you were a whale given a choice between nuclear contamination and talking to Japanese fishermen, which would you choose?

Early work from many big names, including Yoshitaka Amano and Kunio Okawara, is strictly in the studio mould.

Just after learning a fur, he couldn't help but want to go out to be a carpenter. Grandpa discouraged him, but he didn't pay attention. When the giraffe mother and the children were eating, they found that the dining table was broken. They were discussing to find grandpa panda to fix it. The little panda hummed a song and rushed to take over the job. As a result, the repair was repaired and the high table became a low table; Uncle Elephant’s bath tub had a loophole, and the little panda repaired it over and over to make a block of wood. What's more interesting is that when it helped the little monkeys repair the boxes with peaches, they put themselves in them. Little Panda is far from becoming a qualified carpenter.

This ruthless star devours anything that comes in close contact, whether it is life, substance, or even light. The most avid adventurers don't dare to even mention going there, because of the risk. Until one day, a man in fiery red clothing declared to the whole universe: ""In the deepest part of black hole, lies a mysterious place called Rainbow Sea. A place full of precious stones, rivers of gold and rainbow covered skies. Anyone who gets there gets all their wishes granted."" This declaration ignited the enthusiasm of the whole universe, attracting people from everywhere. They followed the man in red into the black hole, and ultimately no one came back. The adventurers that vanished with the man in red were called the descendants of the loathful ""Red Devil"" and Rainbow Sea was then considered as history's biggest lie ever.

Eventually he destroyed the no-fly facility set up by the Evil Galactic Eye organization on Earth.
