It seems that they were set there since the birth of the universe. Such an astonishing scene was captured by a space probe floating in outer space.

Nine dragons and the mysterious bronze coffin made people wonder whether they came back to ancient times or just reached the other shore of the universe. A giant mythical world was unfolded, where immortality gradually appeared and paranormal events continuously occurred.

Countless people started to find their own tracks (The Dao) in such a mythical realm. Their passion was like a turbulent ocean wave that would never cease. The heat in their blood was like erupting volcanoes. Their desire for power and immortality dragged them down to the chasm without knowing it.

Thirty-three classmates held a reunion after graduating. Their friendship was tested, as the bronze coffin took them away from earth and arrived on another unknown planet. The desire for living forced them to follow the path of the ancient gods.

It's not intended to be scary in the slightest, but rather, it focuses on the comical and bizarre things Zombie-kun's body can do, and the common-sense-defying way Zombie-kun behaves. For example, he'll take out his stomach and inflate it with air to use as a pillow, or if he gets wet, he'll detach parts of his body and wring them out like towels, then reattach them with a glue stick. Everything is depicted in a cute, cartoony fashion so as not to be too graphic for kids.
