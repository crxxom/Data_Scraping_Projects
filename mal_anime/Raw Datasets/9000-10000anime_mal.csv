Falling in love, they marry and move to Korea, but their blissful love is short-lived; Sita dies only a year later.

Losing the woman dearest to him, Sangmin desperately begs the gods to bring Sita back. His prayers are answered but in exchange for a sacrifice, and he awakens in the streets of Nepal. However, something is amiss—his body has suddenly aged, and standing in front of him is a young Sita, with no memory of him.

Through two lovers bound together by a destiny running deeper than it first appears, For the Sake of Sita is the story of Sita growing up as a Kumari, and Sangmin's tribulations in trying to avert her terrible fate.

His grades are failing, and his father – traditional and strict (but who must have also at some point gave in and allowed him to have a motorcycle) – is trying everything he can think of to get the kid to apply for college. His mother is so silent, she might as well not even exist. Really, his support system lies entirely in his twinkle-toed little sister, who's nosy but cheers him on in her own way.

Bobby really does little else but work on his bike. He cleans his bike. He tunes up his bike. He rides his bike. One would call him a motorcycle otaku. His most recent achievement seems to have been getting photos of himself on a road trip printed in a motorcyclist hobby magazine. This leads to an unexpected result: a girl his age, who picked up that issue on a whim, decides to write him a letter. A long, rambling letter, but dreamily romantic just the same. Bobby admits to his sister that he's never gotten a letter from a girl before. He writes back, ""I got your letter. I'm happy 'cause it was from a girl.""

Bobby is not a well-rounded kid. He barely speaks – even to his own family – and the ""letters"" he writes back to the mystery girl usually consist of a single sentence or so. His obsession is all-consuming, to the point where he happily quits school to work at a biker bar. Of course, his father, at a loss, kicks him out of the house. Staying with a friend, he's delighted when his female pen pal says she'll call him. On that day, his boss at the bar decides to take him to a motocross track. But that's a day that wouldn't end in a way that anybody would expect.

One recurring gag involves the kid with a turban repeatedly stabbing Souther in the leg every time he climbs the pyramid's staircase, and another involves Rei suddenly transforming into Souther in his iconic moments.

Hidden from the rest of the world, the school is like a secret garden that is home to blossoming flowers. However, bugs sensitive to magic may target and trample them; as one of their tasks, the girls must exterminate these insects.

The smileless Pentagram Arsnotoria lives in the fifth dorm house alongside her adored roommates: the cheerful Mell, the self-paced Little Alberta, the confident Picatrix, and the cool Abramelin. No matter what time of day, they hang out together as much as possible, and even throw tea parties in their secret room after completing their duties. The girls live in peace as they work toward their goal—but there may be more to Ashram and the Pentagrams beyond the calm life they have come to cherish.

Unusually for an anime, a narrator reads Kenji's story aloud while the action is played out on the screen by a succession of warm and evocative illustrations brought to life by subtle touches of animation. If the film feels somehow familiar yet you can't put your finger on the reason why, it's probably the sumptuously minimalist animation by Yasuhiro Nagura, who was the animation director of Mamoru Oshii's artsy 1986 feature Angel's Egg. That, and Kenji's wildcat is said to have been the inspiration for Miyazaki's Panda/Totoro creature. The idea of reading Kenji's story aloud instead of playing it out as a drama is quite refreshing, and Kenji's magical language and narrative style are entirely sufficient to sustain interest. Combined with the spacey music and breathtaking art, the result is a pleasantly unassuming little gem of a film.

Moreover, when someone disconnects from the SHELL system, an extremely rare phenomenon called ""Human Lost"" takes place, transforming humans into monsters—""Lost""—that need to be destroyed, lest society will collapse for good.

Factory worker Takeichi plans to besiege the Ministry of Interior to protest against his inhumane living conditions and manages to convince his friend, the unknown painter Youzou Ooba, to join his cause. But when their suicide operation inevitably fails, Takeichi is left with a body beyond repair and mutates into a Lost, with Youzou immediately following suit.

In the ensuing fight, a member of the dispatch team, Yoshiko Hiiragi, uses her ability to detect the Lost and discovers that Youzou has the unique capacity to return to human form. As the third person who survived after becoming a Lost unit, Youzou soon joins Yoshiko in investigating the recent outburst of Human Lost phenomena that threaten the last chances civilization has to be reborn.

This is a faithful if compressed adaptation, telling the story of Remi who is sold off to Vitalis the travelling musician and his band of performing animals. It has musical numbers typical this era of Toei films, some awkward slapstic, plenty of scenes tailored to pull on the heartstrings, and very smooth animation. Overall a pleasant film that's interesting to watch for the technical aspects; but the story leaves much to be desired, being on the melodramatic-maudlin side.

Although the sword was sealed away long ago, it has been uncovered by the Shoshidai, an organization that collects such cursed artifacts. However, Zsoltgewinn proves to be too strong to be tamed by humans when its corruptive power influences the administrator, Takuma Miura, to flee with it in his grasp.

At the same time, Gai Ogata's family is torn apart due to the possession of another demonic sword, Shiryu, leading his father to be murdered and his mother to hang herself shortly after giving birth to him. Abandoned in the forest clutching the blade, he is discovered by the blacksmith Amon. Unnaturally transfixed by the sword, Gai works tirelessly for years to hone his smithing skills. However, when an accident costs him his arm, he gains a new one—in the form of a reforged Shiryu.

Now having a cursed sword for an arm, Gai must learn to control its violent urges. All the while, Zsoltgewinn continues its rampage, leaving a path of blood in its wake.
