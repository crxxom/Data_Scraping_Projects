Despite Moscow's claim to be striking at military targets, residential areas of many cities have come under sustained attack, while key infrastructure including power plants, bridges and a dam supplying fresh water to Crimea have been hit.  

Ukraine said at least 198 people have so far been killed, including three children. 

There's now a round-the-clock curfew in place in Kyiv, its capture is Russia's primary military objective. 

In the capital, and in cities across the country like Kharkiv, the Ukrainian military seems to be holding out against Russian advances. 

But many sources are saying that the southern city of Melitopol has fallen. 

Tens of thousands of civilians have fled, heading for neighbouring countries in the west.

And yet his life had begun in a very contemporary fashion - an infant refugee from the country of his birth, carried by boat across the Mediterranean. He was also the man who modernised the monarchy, encouraging interaction with ordinary people - an approach embraced by his grandsons. But throughout all those years, he told anyone who would listen that his central role was to support the Queen. And it was a mutual reliance. Elizabeth has described Philip as her ""strength and stay"" and said she and the country owed him a debt greater than he would ever claim ""or we would ever know"".

Jon Snow looks back now on the life and times of Philip Mountbatten.
