0,sjl5zyr_VrU,The Sun,Russian and Belarusian military carryout missile drills at Ukraine border,2022-02-04T12:13:02Z,25,"RUSSIAN Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu reviewed live-fire exercises in western Belarus on Thursday (January 3), part of a surge of military activity close to Ukraine.

Russia, in its biggest deployment to Belarus since the Cold War ended, is expected to have 30,000 troops as well as fighter jets and missile systems for the joint exercises that run until Feb. 20, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said.

The presence of a large Russian force in Belarus has added to western fears that Russia could be preparing to attack Ukraine on multiple fronts. Moscow denies any such intention and says the exercises are defensive in nature.

Ukraine said Russia currently has a total of 115,000 troops near its borders.

Meet Tetyana Chornovol, a former nationalist member of parliament, who has swapped anti-corruption campaigning to be an anti-tank missile operator in the frontline trenches.

Chornovol said: ""I switched it on and saw tanks on the screen. They just entered within the range of my missile. I took aim and destroyed the first tank. Interestingly, the rocket was flying for quite some time.

Perhaps the tanks registered the rocket's launch and managed to turn back but I shot it right at the fuel tanks and the ammunition load has detonated.""

DEAD Russian soldiers were left rotting in their bunkers on Tuesday as Ukraine’s troops overran their positions — but a deadly new onslaught by Putin’s forces is feared within days.

The Sun witnessed scenes of carnage following a major battle outside Kharkiv — even as Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to press on with his slaughter in the east.

Bodies lay slumped in blown-open dugouts after Ukraine seized control of a ridgeline in the three-day battle for Mala Rohan — where soldiers are confident they can defeat Russia.

One said: “Whatever Putin does, we won’t surrender. We have won the battle of Mala Rohan. We are one step closer to winning the war.”

But it comes amid rising fears Russia will unleash chemical weapons to turn the tide in its bloodbath invasion after many defeats.

Dozens of Russian troops in T-72 tanks had dug into a treeline two miles outside Kharkiv and bombarded Ukraine’s second city.

6,IoL_qPSxu-Q,The Sun,"'Give Ukraine weapons, you don't have to fight for us' says Air Force",2022-03-28T09:42:56Z,25,"After more than a month, Russia has failed to seize any major Ukrainian city, but the conflict remains deadly and has killed thousands of people.

Ukrainian Air Force spokesman, Colonel Yuri Ignat, told to Reuters on Saturday (March 26) the country's pilots had trained for years and conducted joint exercises with U.S. pilots precisely because ""we understood that there could be such a scenario"". Ukraine now needs fighter jets such as American F-15s and F-16s to supplement Ukraine's ageing Soviet-era MiG-29s and Sukhoi planes, he said, in order to overcome Russia's numerical and technological superiority in the air.

""We are fighting with the equipment of the '70s and '80s, they are fighting with the equipment of 2010 and later,"" Ignat said.

""We would be grateful for the Soviet-made equipment offered to us by the countries of Central Europe which still have it. But it will not be enough,"" he said, referring to the offer by neighbouring Poland earlier this month to transfer its Russian-made MiG-29 fighter jets to a U.S. base in Germany as a way to replenish Ukraine's air force in its defence against invading Russian forces.

The United States rejected the offer by Poland.

“Give Ukraine weapons, you don't have to fight for us. We don't ask to close the sky anymore. Give us weapons, we will defend ourselves,” Ignat said.

A Ukrainian fighter pilot, known by his Air Force call sign “Juice”, spoke to Reuters from the cockpit of his plane.

“We are taught that we need to be very creative. We need to be tactically flexible,” he said.

“This jet is very capable. It's very manoeuvrable. And everyone just love loves it. But unfortunately, now it's not - it is absolutely not - effective against Russian jets, Russian fighter jets,” he said.

“The main problem for us is not the tactics. It's just zero equipment…the problem is technology,” he added.

Missile attacks have been a feature of Russia's invasion. The bombardment has hit military targets as well as residential areas, schools and hospitals in Ukrainian cities including Kharkiv and the besieged port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov. Moscow denies it is targeting civilians.

Russia says the operation was necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia while Russian speakers were being persecuted in Ukraine.

A police officer guarding the Prime Minister's official home had to knock on the famous black door to summon someone to open it.

The door can't be opened from the outside because it has no handle.

Instead a member of No10 staff had to come and open it from the inside, allowing Larry to slip back in to the warmth.

The whole incident was caught on camera in the background of a Sky News live broadcast.

Viewers were distracted from the political update by the feline's antics.

In a surprise prisoner swap – former U.S. marine Trevor Reed, who was detained in Russia since 2019, has been released.

Russian pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko - who was serving a 20-year sentence in the United States for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine – was released in return.

The swap, which U.S. officials have said was the result of months of hard and careful work, comes as U.S.-Russia relations are at their worst in decades.

Officials said the talks that led to Reed’s release strictly focused on securing his freedom… and was not the start of a broader diplomatic conversation.

President Joe Biden did not comment on details of the release, but said (quote) ""The negotiations that allowed us to bring Trevor home required difficult decisions that I do not take lightly.""

Russian missiles pounded Ukraine as families cowered in shelters and air raid sirens wailed across the major cities on the second day of Putin's full-scale invasion.

But Russia also appeared to be advancing on the outskirts of Kharkiv nearly 300 miles away as Russian forces drove deeper into Ukraine.

Our Sun man Jerome was forced to duck for cover with Ukrainian troops as Russian shells rained down nearby.

Reporting from the outskirts of the city, Jerome said: ""Everyone just had to take cover... we could hear the shells going over.""

Dramatic footage filmed on the front line showed a Ukrainian soldier diving in front of our defence editor in the thick snow as explosions are heard in the distance.

A Ukrainian soldier later showed off his trophies of enemy kills to Jerome as they stood in the trenches.

The soldier could be seen standing in the blizzard holding up a collection of patches he claimed to have taken from slain Russian troops.

13,do0PKIr0YbQ,The Sun,In Full: Kevin McCarthy & GOP visit US-Mexico border ICE facility amid border crisis,2021-03-15T18:37:35Z,25,"McCarthy & GOP visit US-Mexico border and ICE facilityy in El Paso.

Last week House Republicans held a news 'Joe Biden Border Crisis' conference on US President's failing border policies.

The US Department of Homeland Security over the weekend ordered an emergency agency that usually responds to floods, storms, and other major disasters to help care for a growing number of migrant children arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, has been instructed to help receive, shelter, and transport children over the next 90 days.

The move signals the scope of a growing humanitarian and political crisis for President Joe Biden, who has reversed some of the restrictive border policies of his predecessor, Donald Trump.

A spike in children arriving without parents or legal guardians has exceeded shelter capacity, which was previously cut by 40% to limit the spread of COVID-19.

Those shelter restrictions were lifted on March 5th, but only about 200 beds have come back online, an administration official said Friday (March 12).

Migrant children apprehended at the border are supposed to be transferred out of Border Patrol custody within 72 hours. But when shelter space is limited, they can get stuck in border detention centers for longer periods - as is happening now.

A U.S. official told Reuters that more than 3,600 migrant children were being held in U.S. border facilities as of the end of last week, more than four times the number in late February.

And as of Friday, the Department of Health and Human Services’ refugee office had approximately 8,800 unaccompanied children in custody.

The president took questions from reporters for the first time on Thursday afternoon, but quickly began to make mistakes.

AS he finished answering a question about filibuster, Biden appeared to trail off-thought, ending with a pause, concluding ""anyway.""

""...If you hold near and dear to you that you uh um like to be able to um...."" Biden said, before concluding ""anyway.""

Biden then closed his eyes and appeared to struggle to form the next sentence.

However, after seconds of confusion, he quickly told reassured viewers ""we're ready to get a lot done.""

He then appeared to call out a name from a list of White House reporters who were quizzing the president.

Going back to his list at a later point of the conference, Biden asked ""where am I"" before asking CNN's Kaitlan Collins for another question.

In September 2022, Russian forces fled the Ukrainian town of Balakliia.

But they left their traces everywhere.

One of them is this abandoned building, which the Russians used as a military base during their occupation of Balakliia.

It was here that Reuters discovered thousands of documents revealing the inner workings of the Russian military.

Inside, posters reading ""do not smoke, do not litter,"" ""if we leave, they will come.""

Notebooks and loose papers showing coordinates of Russian intelligence units, records of calls from commanders, details of battles, names of men killed, equipment destroyed.

And accounts of a breakdown in morale and discipline.

In all, Reuters reviewed more than a thousand pages of documents.

They shed new light on events leading up to one of President Vladimir Putin's most stinging battlefield defeats: Russia’s chaotic retreat from Ukraine’s northeast in September.

Moscow is understood to have lost the 12,490 ton missile cruiser, the Slava-class Moskva, after it was hit by a pair of Neptune cruise missiles fired by Ukraine.

Russia confirmed explosions on the vessel which is the flagship for its Black Sea Fleet.

Moskva has played a deadly role in the war by bombarding Ukrainian towns from positions at sea.

Ukraine is reported to have harassed the vessel with a drone as a distraction before striking the with two cruise missiles.

Moscow said the crew had been ordered to abandon ship amid reports that the 611ft vessel was sinking.

21,l-u7Qln1q6s,The Sun,British-led Dark Angels team blast Russian positions with a Javelin anti-tank missiles,2022-06-24T23:00:12Z,25,"A BRIT-led team of international volunteers blasted a Russian position with a Javelin anti-tank missile on Ukraine’s front line.

The daredevil squad, led by ex-Para Daniel Burke, crept into no-man’s land in occupied Kherson province to launch the rocket attack.

Their unit, known as the Dark Angels, began the commando-style raid after troops from Ukraine’s 28th Brigade gave them an £80,000 fire-and-forget missile.

Body cam footage shot by fellow Brit fighter Sam Newey — a ­student from Birmingham with no previous military experience — shows the four-man team creeping up to a ridge line to fire the US-made guided weapon.

Britain has given Ukraine some 200 Javelin missiles which have a maximum range of 2.5km. The US donated thousands more.

The Sun met the volunteers at their bunker HQ in a bomb-blitzed frontline village.

The highest ranking volunteer was a former US Marine sergeant, Chris.

Others include a German-born bartender, British ex-con Mark Ayres, 49, and a US gun enthusiast, Justin, 29, who fought in Afghanistan.

Burke formed the Dark Angels to deliver humanitarian aid and provide medical and military training.

His volunteers are all unpaid — and laugh off Russian claims they are far-right foreign mercenaries.

The Israel Defence Force (IDF) said air and ground forces launched a series of attacks last night - dropping 450 missiles on the Gaza Strip in just 40 minutes.

As the conflict escalated, some 160 aircraft were flying simultaneously to conduct a massive attack on the terrorist group in Gaza last night.

This 40-minute airstrike was the largest Israeli strike since the outbreak of fighting earlier this week, the military says.

And 9,000 Israeli reserve troops have been called up amid the escalating violence in the region.

Palestinians militants have fired some 1,800 rockets and the military has launched more than 600 airstrikes, toppling at least three apartment blocks.

And on Thursday night, an additional 220 projectiles were fired on Israel from Gaza.

The IDF had previously said soldiers on the ground had entered the Palestinian enclave - as its fighter jets continued to hit targets belonging to militants.

The force tweeted: ""IDF air and ground troops are currently attacking in the Gaza Strip.""

Exclusive by Valerie Browne

Donate to Vans Without Borders here: https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/p/vans-without-borders-ukraine-vital-aid-fundraiser


During their last mission, they pioneered routes across Ukraine and were some of the first humanitarian volunteers to deliver international aid in Bucha, Irpin and Chernihiv, after they were devastated.

Their team has now grown to four vans and we will be looking to bring tonnes of aid across Ukraine, but need your help to achieve this.

Every penny you donate will be spent directly on helping the Ukrainian people, as all of our team members are volunteers - unlike international organisations who take up to 15% of donations for salaries.

To fill one van with canned food and essential supplies - sourced from a local Ukrainian business - it costs around £1,500.

A large part of our mission is also delivering targeted aid to vulnerable refugees such as those with disabilities, children and the elderly.

30,iziFgZ8fq6U,The Sun,British Freedom Fighters join Ukraine's foreign legion vowing to fight against 'Russia's war crimes',2022-03-07T17:08:50Z,25,"Ukraine has established a foreign ""international"" legion for volunteers from abroad and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has publicly urged foreigners to ""fight side-by-side with Ukrainians against the Russian war criminals"" in order to show support for his country.

Last week, Zelenskyy said that more than 16,000 foreigners have answered his call.

Some of the foreign fighters in Ukraine say they were attracted by the cause: to halt an unprovoked attack they view as a once-in-a-generation showdown between the forces of democracy and dictatorship.

Standing outside the ticket hall of Lviv station on Sunday were a group of British men in military uniform, waiting for a train to Kyiv. They were in high spirits, often exchanging fist-bumps and handshakes with Ukrainian refugees who thanked them for fighting for their country.

They were led by Ben Grant, a strapping Englishman from Essex, who had just completed a month-long stint as a security advisor in Iraq. He was unclear whether his men would be deployed independently or as part of a Ukrainian unit.

""We're going to wait and see what the situation is as we get further in,"" said Grant. It's all going to depend on...where they need us.""

Another member of the group, an Englishman in his twenties who identified himself as Jax, said his family was proud but “not happy” that he had come to Ukraine.

Even those who have previously seen fighting might struggle in Ukraine's war zones warned a British soldier who identified himself only by his nickname, Kruger. He said he had served in the British military for seven years and was a veteran of Afghanistan who trained other soldiers.

""If you're out here as a war tourist, this is not the place for you,"" he said. ""The realities of war, if you head out to the front, are going to be pretty overwhelming.""

The Hollywood megastar has worked tirelessly behind the scenes to enforce tight social-distancing rules during the filming, taking place in Britain.

And he flew into a rage after spotting two of the crew standing within two metres of each other.

An audio tape captured Cruise shouting: “If I see you do it again, you’re f***ing gone. And if anyone in this crew does it, that’s it — and you too and you too. And you, don’t you ever f***ing do it again.”

Fifty members of staff at Warner Bros. Studios in Leavesden, Herts, were left stunned by the angry outburst.

The arrival of the choppers was first announced last week, when it was billed as a participation to the bi-annual international U.S.-led exercise Saber Strike.

But on Thursday the Lithuanian defence minister was describing them as part of U.S. military reinforcements to the Baltic region after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Some forty U.S. service members arrived in Latvia from Italy earlier on Thursday, the first group of what is expected to be a deployment of more than 300 troops, the Latvian Defence Ministry said.

33,H6uingtAWbk,The Sun,Biden’s biggest gaffes and failures after one year in office,2022-01-20T16:00:18Z,25,"ON January 20, 2021, Joe Biden vowed to overcome Covid and pledged America would ""lead by example"" in the world following years of unpredictability during the Trump administration

But, during his first year in office, the US has been blighted by foreign policy blunders in Afghanistan and is facing the prospect of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.

And back home, the US is in a fight against the highly transmissible Omicron Covid-19 variant. 

Polling paints a grim picture for the Biden administration as 62 percent disapprove of the president’s handling of the economy, while 69 percent say the White House’s Covid messaging has been confusing. 

And, US party preferences appear to have shifted as 47 percent say they are either strong or lean Republican - a seven-point rise compared to the first quarter of 2021, according to Gallup.

Meanwhile, only 42 percent of Americans identify themselves as strong or lean Democrats, down from 49 percent at the start of 2021.

The last time the GOP held a five-point lead in party advantage was 1995 when they had just taken control of the House for the first time since the 1950s.

The Sun takes a look at the crises that have plagued the Biden Administration in his first year in office.

Now petrolhead Jeremy Clarkson is finding out what it really takes to make a living from the land. And it is far harder — and more frustrating — than belting around in a half-a-million-pound supercar on his other TV show, The Grand Tour.

Teaming up with the National Farmers’ Union (NFU), Jeremy wants the Government to commit to Britain remaining at least 60 per cent self-sufficient in food. It has slipped from nearly 80 per cent in the 1980s.

Helping to launch the NFU’s new Food Report, Jeremy is also asking shoppers to buy British products, which he insists are better quality and greener.

He gave the Sun an exclusive tour of the Diddly Squat farm and showed off several new additions to his estate.

35,hVs3gFmHa-o,The Sun,40-mile Russian convoy headed to Kyiv has 'virtually stalled for over a week',2022-03-09T11:44:08Z,25,"The 40-mile (64 km) long Russian military column convoy heading toward Kyiv has ""virtually stalled for over a week and sits about 15 miles out from the city"", said The Washington Post.

""Mechanical breakdown, congestion and morale issues, plus food and fuel supplies running low"", are cited by the BBC as contributing factors to the extremely slow progress.

“Additionally, one former commander of the U.K. Joint Forces Command, told the BBC command and control issues such as faulty radio networks are likely to be causing bigger problems.”

“The Associated Press, meanwhile, reports that Ukrainian resistance may also account for some of the slowdown, with one senior U.S. defense official saying Ukrainian troops have been targeting the convoy with ground fire, including shoulder-fired Javelin anti-tank missiles, and essentially creating roadblocks when vehicles at the front of the convoy are struck.”

“Alternatively, though, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby has suggested that the vehicles, which he says are largely meant for ‘resupply’ purposes, could be deliberately paused as the Russians regroup themselves.”

“Cited by The Washington Post last week, the director of the Security and Defense Studies Program at Turkish think tank EDAM[a], added detail to that suggestion, explaining the convoy’s delay could be partially the result of Russia’s attempt to move away from a failed plan to ‘decapitate’ the Ukrainian government quickly.”

“The Russian forces are instead now trying to transition to ‘Soviet-type heavy fire power and armor-focused operations,’ he said.”

“Going further, the former head of the British Army, General Lord Dannatt, told the BBC ‘This enormous column ... will encircle and lay siege to the capital,’ Kyiv, where the New Yorker reported last week that thousands of those residents still in the city are seeking shelter every night in its metro system.”

37,RwaxSarKj-c,The Sun,US Forces load Howitzers bound for Ukraine,2022-05-03T14:10:42Z,25,"More than half of the M777 howitzer artillery units promised to Ukraine by the Pentagon have been delivered, according to US Defence officials.

Video, released by the US Air Force, shows Marines and Air Force personnel loading artillery on a C-17 Globemaster III at March Air Reserve base, in California, on April 26.

In April, the US announced it would send a total of 90 howitzers to support Ukraine defend itself from Russia’s invasion, along with nearly 184,000 shells. As of April 29, defense officials said that around 60 percent of the units were already on the ground in the country. The Pentagon says the howitzers would be “very effective” in fighting in the eastern Donbas region, where Russia has refocused much of its military effort.

38,g5is-C8koUI,The Sun,NATO warning over fears 'Russia may not stop with Ukraine',2022-03-21T20:00:09Z,25,"RUSSIA'S invasion of Ukraine has stirred fears in NATO that a new iron curtain could fall across Europe - dividing its Baltic members from the rest. It is bolstering forces in that area to reflect what Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg calls 'the new normal'.

Direct confrontation between NATO and Russia could touch off a global conflict. One retired NATO commander told Reuters the alliance is considering whether deterrence is enough.

Not according to Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis last week.

He said: ""We are convinced in the Baltic states that we need to move from deterrence to a standing defence and it has to come from NATO planning leadership, that they will start looking into the region differently than they had throughout the last two decades.""

46,rnfCM3R7w04,The Sun,Ukraine braces for Russian 'battles ahead' after Zelensky 'fires two traitor generals',2022-04-01T10:55:22Z,25,"Ukraine is bracing for new attacks from Russia with leader Volodymyr Zelensky warning late Thursday of 'battles ahead.'

He said the situation in the south and southwestern Donbas region remained 'extremely difficult', and also said again that Russia was building up forces near the besieged port city of Mariupol.

""Also, in the Donbas, in Mariupol, in the Kharkiv direction, the Russian troops are accumulating the potential for strikes - powerful strikes. We will defend ourselves. We will do everything we can to stop the occupiers and cleanse our land of their evil and senseless chimeras.”

And in a rare sign of internal dissent, Zelensky also announced he was firing two generals on the grounds they were traitors.

""Those high-ranking servicemen, who have been prevented from deciding where their homeland is, who break the military oath of allegiance to the Ukrainian people for the protection of our state, its freedom and independence, will inevitably be deprived of high military ranks.""

Earlier on Thursday a Russian missile strike in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv hit gas pipes, cutting off supplies to tens of thousands of people there.

Kharkiv, the country's second largest city, has suffered some of the heaviest shelling since Russia invaded Ukraine more than a month ago.

Zelenskiy however said his forces had pushed back the Russian military from the capital Kyiv and the nearby city of Chernihiv.

At talks this week, Moscow said it would reduce offensives in both cities as a goodwill gesture and focus on what it called 'liberating' Donbas.

After weeks of constant shelling, the city of Mariupol has no running water, gas or electricity - another obstacle for those who remain as they fight to survive.

A spokesperson for Mariupol's mayor said on Monday nearly 5000 people had already been killed.

Ukrainian authorities were hoping to evacuate more residents from Mariupol after Russia agreed to open a humanitarian corridor on Friday, but several previous deals have collapsed.

Russia says it is carrying out a 'special operation' to disarm and 'denazify' its neighbour.

But it denies Kyiv's accusations that they are targeting civilians.

Western countries say Putin's real aim was to topple Ukraine's government.

Peace negotiations are set to resume by video conference on Friday.

47,LCeXRZnmDTM,The Sun,Knifeman stabs two paramedics leaving gaping wound inches from heart,2021-07-09T15:33:06Z,25,"THE terrifying moment a knifeman stabbed two paramedics in the chest and back while they were out on a 999 callout.

Brave NHS workers Deena Evans, 40, and Michael Hipgrave, 52, were knifed and left with gaping wounds while on duty in Wolverhampton, West Mids, in July last year.

Mum-of-three Deena was stabbed once in the chest and fellow medic dad Michael was slashed across his back by 52-year-old Martyn Smith.

He was today locked up for nine years at Wolverhampton Crown Court after admitting two counts of wounding with intent.

The court heard how Mick and Deena were attacked by jobless Smith with two large kitchen knives.

Neighbours said they heard ""blood curdling screams"" and the ambulance workers shouting ""please help, he's got a knife"" during the terrifying incident.

Graphic images of the wounds were released, along with stills from police body-worn video footage, showing Ms Evans lying on the grass, with an injured Mr Hipgrave.

In a victim impact statement read in court, Deena told how she relives the attack every time she shuts her eyes.

Speaking out about the brutal attack, she told Smith: “Your sentence will not give me back the year I lost, neither will it take away my painful and ugly scar, or the mental stress you caused.

48,bHo3EvlOBmU,The Sun,Furious row after toddler ‘hit and dragged by cyclist’,2020-09-10T13:58:51Z,25,"A one-year-old girl was left with scratches on her face after she was hit and dragged along the ground by a cyclist who allegedly tried to flee the scene.

Freya Clancy, who is just 16 months old, was walking on a pedestrian path in Victoria Park, East London, when a cyclist travelling at “around 10mph hit her head on”.

Her arm then got caught in the spokes and the toddler was dragged along the ground until the cyclist slammed on her brakes at around 9am yesterday.

The girl’s stunned mum, Victoria Grant, told The Sun Online: “The cyclist came flying out of the gate and her front wheel hit my daughter in the face.

“It was awful. I was screaming and shouting ‘you have just run over my daughter’.”

Video footage taken at the scene shows the irate woman arguing with a local and Victoria claims she did not apologise or ask how her daughter was.

Footage also shows the woman speaking to an off-duty police officer in the park.

She told him: ""The kid comes into the middle of my path, I don't even see the kid.

""They're all ganging up on me. The kid runs right in front of my path.""

Freya was then rushed to Royal London Hospital where she had an x-ray on her arm, but luckily nothing was broken.

Victoria, 33, has now been told to moisturise her face to prevent the scratches from leaving a scar.

The mum-of-three is now trying to track the cyclist down after she claims the woman wouldn't pass on her details.
