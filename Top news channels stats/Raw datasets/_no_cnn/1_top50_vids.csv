Taliban forces occupied the Presidential Palace, from where they are preparing to announce that they are the new rulers of an “Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan”. 

It’s the culmination of a lightning takeover by the Islamist fighters, following the decision by the United States and other coalition nations to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan.   

Coalition troops first entered the country in 2001 following the 9/11 attacks and removed the Taliban from power.   20 years of fighting to support the new Afghan government cost thousands of lives. 

The decision of the US President Joe Biden to withdraw all US forces by September paved the way for the final Taliban offensive that overwhelmed the Afghan government's forces.

Foreign nationals and many Afghans have been trying to get on flights out of Kabul airport, where US and British troops have been deployed to aid the evacuation.

The Russian invasion has been hampered by stiff Ukrainian resistance and logistical issues.

Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg also said Russia's war in Ukraine is not going to plan and that its attempt to capture the eastern Donbas region has ""stalled"".

""They failed to take Kyiv, they are pulling back from around Kharkiv, their major offensive in Donbas has stalled. Russia is not achieving its strategic objectives,"" he said.

Stoltenberg added that Ukraine could win the conflict.

Finland and Sweden are both expected to make a formal request to join the Western alliance, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Russian President Vladimir Putin warned his Finnish counterpart Sauli Niinistö that joining Nato and abandoning Finland's neutral status would be a ""mistake.""

Putin also said there was no threat to Finland's security, with which Russia shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border.

The Russian foreign ministry has indicated there will be retaliation, and the country's decision to suspend electricity supplies to Finland is being seen as an early sign of this.

But it's not just their exquisite condition that's turning heads - it's what these ancient specimens purport to represent.

The claim is the Tanis creatures were killed on the actual day the asteroid struck Earth 66 million years ago, which saw the reign of dinosaurs end.
