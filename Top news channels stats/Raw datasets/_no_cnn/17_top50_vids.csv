We're going in for the advertised $19.99 oil change, but you won't believe the charges we end up with. And did they even do the work? We go up on the hoist to show you what’s really going down at these oil change shops.

But industry experts tell us some of them are duping customers with the promise of a quick and cheap fix, only to end up ripping you off. CBC Marketplace uncovers a network of fake local business locations and fake five-star reviews cluttering Google Maps in the Greater Toronto Area.

We also rig up a house with hidden cameras to test locksmiths advertising their services online, and expose how some companies use low prices, fake names, fake addresses and fake reviews to lure you in. Google says it is now auditing every locksmith listing in Canada following our investigation.

5,K3ksKkCOgTw,CBC News,The Secrets of Sugar - the fifth estate,2014-10-03T16:56:02Z,25,"We’ve heard for years about the dangers of eating too much fat or salt. But there have never been recommended limits for sugar on Canadian food labels, despite emerging research that suggests the sweet stuff may be making more of us fat and sick. In the fifth estate’s season premiere, Gillian Findlay digs into the surprising science — and the reaction from the food industry — to reveal The Secrets of Sugar. Has the sugar industry been hiding an unsavoury truth from consumers?

A small but influential group of medical researchers is stirring up the health debate, linking sugar not just to rising obesity rates but also to a host of diseases including cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer’s.

We put a family of four on a healthy diet to try to beat their sugar habit and track the surprising results. We talk to leading scientists – and their critics. And we ask the food industry why those ingredient labels are far from clear when it comes to how much sugar is really on your plate.

Many of you have come forward with stories of being contacted by these scammers and asked why authorities can’t do more to stop these schemes. We’ve always wondered: Are there accomplices in Canada?

The visual was inadvertently used in a segment that discusses how some stolen vehicles from Canada are being resold overseas. That visual has since been removed. Banix Motors have indicated that they have never been associated with the sale of stolen vehicles from Canada and CBC never intended to associate Banix Motors with our investigation.

Cars stolen from driveways and shopping malls in Canada are ending up overseas. Some of the most-stolen vehicles include the Honda CR-V, Toyota Highlander, Lexus RX and Ford F-150. Marketplace has found stolen Canadian vehicles in West Africa. Highly organized criminal gangs are using the proceeds to fund and commit other crimes. We show how quick and easy it is for thieves to make off with vehicles using inexpensive tools that are readily available and ask why carmakers aren’t doing more to enhance security.

For more information, visit: http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/episodes/2014-2015/orange-juice-juicy-secrets
Marketplace bites into breakfast, spilling juicy secrets about premium orange juice and putting popular breakfast sandwiches to the test.

About two-thirds of us have bought premium orange juice in the past six months, many convinced by claims of pure and natural juice, which make it seem like oranges fall off the tree into the carton. But that’s not the whole story. Tom Harrington talks to juice lovers and an expert who wrote the book on OJ, revealing just how much it is processed and what the labels don’t tell you.
