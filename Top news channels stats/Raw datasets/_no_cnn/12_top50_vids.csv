Harris and Pence traded accusations over the federal response to the pandemic that has claimed the lives of more than 210,000 Americans, with Harris harshly criticizing the administration's record. President Trump tested positive for the coronavirus just six days ago.

""The American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country,"" Harris said, with Pence sitting 12 feet away from her, separated by two panes of plexiglass as protection against the virus.

Pence, who again tested negative for the coronavirus earlier in the day, defended the administration's response and said the president's moves in the early days of the pandemic saved lives.

USA Today's Susan Page moderated the vice presidential debate. The next debate between Mr. Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden is scheduled for Thursday, Oct. 15 in Miami and will be moderated by C-SPAN's Steve Scully.

28,box4SFtGvA0,CBS News,Esports: Inside the relentless training of professional gaming stars,2018-12-24T00:58:46Z,25,"Professional, competitive video game playing—the phenomenon known as esports—has seen double digit growth for much of the past decade. With a massive following, many say it will soon become an official Olympic event. Throughout the U.S., high schools are launching competitive gaming clubs, and even some colleges are offering scholarships to top players.

It’s a dream come true for professional esports players—traveling the world and paid salaries to play video games full time for a living.

But as money continues to pour into the industry, the pressure on these young pros—many still in their teens—is leading to early burnout from high stress, repetitive stress injuries, and grueling practice schedules.

In this episode of CBSN Originals, we follow pro esports players Doublelift (League of Legends) and Space (Overwatch) as they compete for glory, get an inside look at what it takes to be pro, and explore the risks many are taking to stay at the top.

The panel detailed former President Donald Trump’s pressure on the Justice Department to overturn the 2020 election results. In the last two weeks, the committee has outlined how Trump and his allies pushed false claims of election fraud leading up to Jan. 6, 2021. Trump then encouraged his supporters to descend on the Capitol to stop former Vice President Mike Pence from certifying the Electoral College votes. Tuesday’s hearing focused on the threats made to state lawmakers, election officials and workers in Arizona and Georgia. Former election worker Shaye Moss testified that she and her family were threatened “all because of lies” about the election being stolen.

48,RxDqK94xi1k,CBS News,House votes to impeach President Trump a second time,2021-01-14T00:41:54Z,25,"The House of Representatives voted Wednesday to impeach President Trump on one count of incitement of insurrection, making him the first president in U.S. history to be impeached twice. The vote came exactly one week after a mob of the president's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol building in an effort to block Congress from counting the Electoral College votes and confirming President-elect Joe Biden's victory.

The vote was 232 in favor, 197 opposed. Ten Republicans joined 222 Democrats in voting to impeach.

The article of impeachment, introduced Monday by House Democrats, accuses Mr. Trump of ""willfully inciting violence against the government of the United States"" in violation of his constitutional oath and duty.
