On this week's Meet the Germans, Rachel Stewart finds out why the Germans just love to get naked for a communal sweat session.
Rachel is on a mission to investigate the quirks and idiosyncrasies of daily life in Germany. Every two weeks she explores a new topic - from beer to sauna etiquette to complicated grammar - and heads out to get some tips from the Germans themselves. 

Rachel moved from the UK to Germany in 2016. As a relative newcomer she casts a fresh eye over German clichés and shares her experiences of settling into German life. You'll find more from Meet the Germans on YouTube or at dw.com/MeettheGermans.

3,gDu9kVy17Vw,DW News,Vast 65 km Russian military convoy advances towards Kyiv | DW News,2022-03-01T07:47:07Z,25,"A massive Russian military convoy consisting of hundreds of tanks, trucks, towed artillery pieces and support vehicles has been pictured slowly making its way toward Kyiv. Satellite images provided by the US company Maxar Technologies show the convoy spanning a distance of about 40 miles (65 kilometers). The Ukrainian news agency UNIAN also reported the same length early on Tuesday. The convoy, which is longer than previously thought, is inching slowly toward the outskirts of the Ukrainian capital. Up until now, Ukrainian forces have managed to slow the Russian invasion, but it is unclear just how long they will be to fend off the Russian push for the capital.

More than 70 Ukrainian troops were killed when Russian troops shelled a military base in the town of Okhtyrka, regional governor Dmytro Zhyvytskyy said on Facebook. Okhtyrka is located in Ukraine's northeastern Sumy region, which borders Russia.

UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has confirmed the deaths of 102 civilians, including seven children, since the Russian invasion began on Thursday. Hundreds more had been injured, and the figures provided were likely to be undercounted.  Residents of Kyiv who have remained in the city have hunkered down in the subway stations.


Russia and Ukraine broke off peace talks Monday, which were held on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border. A follow-on round will take place in the coming days. Ukraine had demanded an immediate Russian cease-fire and troop withdrawal as its delegation arrived in Belarus for talks with Russian negotiators.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a formal request for his country to join the European Union as EU leaders said they might discuss the possibility of Ukraine joining the 27-nation bloc at an informal summit in March.
The UN said that more than 500,000 people had fled the country and were seeking safety in neighboring countries.
The US ordered 12 members of Russia's diplomatic mission to the United Nations in New York to be expelled, mandating their departures by March 7, said Russia's ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya.
Sanctions have taken a toll on Russia's economy, with the Central Bank announcing that it will raise its key interest rate to an unprecedented 20%, up from 9.5%, in the face of new sanctions following the invasion of Ukraine. 
The Russian ruble plunged almost 30% against the dollar.
On Monday, hundreds of anti-war protesters were arrested in both Russia and Belarus, according to human rights watchdogs.

For the first time in its history, the European Union will purchase weapons for a country under attack, said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. In a meeting on Sunday, EU foreign minister agreed to budget €500 million ($564 million) for weapons and equipment for Ukraine. Poland agreed to work as a logistic hub for the delivery of weapons. She also said EU airspace would be closed to Russia-owned, registered or controlled aircraft, explicitly mentioning that the ban would apply to ""the private jets of oligarchs."" Additionally, von der Leyen announced the 27-member bloc would take steps to stop ""the Kremlin's media machine in the EU"" by banning state-owned Russia Today, Sputnik and their subsidiaries. ""We are developing tools to ban their toxic and harmful disinformation in Europe,"" she said. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the move was aimed at ""turning off the tap for Russia's disinformation in Europe."" In addition to the measures against Russia, von der Leyen added that the EU agreed to sanction Russia's ally Belarus, which she called ""the other aggressor in this war."" In a message to the hundreds of thousands of people fleeing Ukraine, von der Leyen said they would be welcomed with ""open arms.""

Kyiv and Moscow have sent envoys to peace talks on the Belarus border. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was willing to ""try"" talks with Russia but added he is ""skeptical"" they will lead to a ceasefire. ""I will be honest, as always: I do not really believe in the outcome of this meeting, but let them try,"" Zelenskyy said in a video statement. If there was a ""chance"" to end the war, he should take part in the talks, he added

In his nightly video address, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised the Ukrainian people for surviving so long under relentless attack. Ukraine is also claiming a victory in its efforts to repel Russian forces at sea.
Russia's military has confirmed that its main warship in the Black Sea, the Moskva, sank while being towed back to port in stormy weather. Moscow says the ship suffered a fire and explosion. But Ukraine says the damage was caused by its missiles hitting the vessel on Wednesday off the port of Odesa. 
The loss of the warship is a setback for Russia, and a symbolic victory for Ukraine, which Zelenskyy picked up on in his address.

7,3wnRxZu7_Qw,DW News,"Russian troops meet with stiff resistance, Ukrainian forces retake Kharkiv | DW News",2022-02-27T14:22:37Z,25,"Scholz pledges €100 billion for German military, end to Russian energy exports
A turning point in the history of our continent. That's how Chancellor Olaf Scholz described Russia's war against Ukraine. Speaking to a special session of parliament, the German leader announced a raft of policy changes that would have been unthinkable just days ago. Germany will drastically strengthen its military, and move quickly to eliminate its reliance on Russian energy exports. He put the blame squarely on Russian President Vladimir Putin - who he said had brought decades of peaceful coexistence to an end. Here's some of what he said.
Holding out in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said Russia's military assault verges on genocide - and he's called for Russia to be stripped of its seat on the UN Security Council. Moscow's forces targeted civilian infrastructure overnight, including gas pipelines - as they stepped up efforts to push further into Ukraine.
Moscow's forces have met stiff resistance as they attempt to push further into Ukraine. The mayor of Kyiv says the capital is holding its defense lines and there are no Russian troops in the city. And after reports of heavy fighting in eastern Kharkiv, the regional governor says Ukrainian forces have retaken full control of the city. Russia's latest attacks have targeted civilian infrastructure and the military.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine has sent tens of thousands of people fleeing their homes since Thursday. Huge crowds have been waiting at train stations to travel to the border and cross into neighboring countries. Scenes from Lviv in western Ukraine show the fear and frustration: There's not enough space on the trains to carry everyone to safety. Men are forced to say goodbye to their families, as they are not allowed to leave because they've been called up to fight. Many of the refugees are headed to Poland.
Ukraine is doing its best to repel the Russian attack by training civilians to fight. Support from the US and other NATO members has also bolstered national defenses. But few believe Ukraine is a match for its much larger neighbor. 
Taking active and reserve troops together, Kyiv can draw on more than 1 million men and women. Russia has more than three million. Ukraine has less than 2,500 tanks, compared to Russia's 13,000.
And in the air, Ukraine has just 67 attack aircraft in contrast to Russia's 1,500.
In Berlin a demonstration calling for restoring peace in Ukraine is underway, with estimates of 20,000 or more people taking part in the protest.
The demonstration is organized by a variety of groups including workers' unions, religious groups and environmental organizations. Protesters are calling on Russia to immediately withdraw from Ukraine and to respect democracy and human rights. In the past days there have been numerous demonstrations across the world in support of Ukraine and demanding an immediate end to all violence.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the House of Commons by video link Tuesday evening, and received a standing ovation after paraphrasing one of Winston Churchill's famous wartime speeches in vowing his continued resistance of Russia's invasion.

""We will not give up and we will not lose. We will fight to the end, at sea, in the air. We will continue fighting for our land, whatever the cost, in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets,"" Zelenskyy said.

The Ukrainian president added his country was fighting for its survival, and called on UK lawmakers to continue applying pressure on the Kremlin with sanctions.

Zelenskyy's address to a packed house in the Westminster chamber came shortly after the UK announced it would be phasing out imports of Russian oil in response to the invasion of Ukraine.

US President Joe Biden said that the US will also no longer import Russian oil.

""We will not be part of subsidizing Putin's war,"" Biden said. Energy imports provide a vital source of income for the Kremlin.

What could the next stage look like? The Kremlin has declined to comment on details of the military operation, and its Defense Ministry is adamant that the campaign has been successful. A senior US defense official said there were indications that in the last 24 hours Moscow had become frustrated by slow progress due to the unexpectedly strong Ukrainian defense and failure to achieve complete air dominance. The UK's Ministry of Defense tweeted that Russian military progress was stalling. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, notes that Ukrainian resistance remains highly effective, despite the Russians' huge advantage in firepower.

Analysts say that the Russian military leadership has been taken by surprise by the lack of impact its aerial campaign is having. ""The Russian forces have a hard time suppressing the air defense and aerospace forces of Ukraine and Ukrainian forces,"" Mathieu Boulegue, a research fellow with the Russia and Eurasia Program at Chatham House, a London-based think tank, told DW. The Pentagon believes that Russia has currently moved at least 50% of its forces into Ukraine out of an estimated 150,000 troops amassed at the border. It's not just the regular army making inroads against the Russian forces but also volunteers who have formed militias and are arming themselves with home-made Molotov cocktails, setting up road blocks and removing road signs to confuse Russian troops.
Most analysts predict that the current war phase is just the first stage of a multi-pronged tactic and that the Russian military will now broaden the campaign.

Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said the weapons would be delivered as soon as possible to support the Ukrainian military. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it was Germany's ""duty to support Ukraine to the best of its ability in defending itself against the invading army of Vladimir Putin.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised Germany's decision to send weapons, in a major reversal of policy for Berlin. ""Keep it up, Chancellor Olaf Scholz! Anti-war coalition in action!"" Zelenskyy tweeted. 

Earlier Saturday Berlin authorized NATO partners the Netherlands and Estonia arms deliveries to Ukraine. For the Netherlands, 400 German-made anti-tank weapons are involved, while Estonia was granted approval to sent artillery from old GDR (East German) stocks. 

The move marks a major change of course for Germany, which had until now refused the delivery of lethal weapons to Ukraine due to its policy of not sending weapons to a conflict zone.

The Netherlands also said it would sent anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, according to the Dutch defense ministry.

Ukraine's delegation is set to meet Russian representatives for the first talks since Moscow's invasion, as the fighting for several Ukrainian cities continues and the Russian rouble collapses. ""The Ukrainian delegation arrived at the Ukrainian-Belarusian border to take part in talks with representatives of the Russian Federation,"" the Ukrainian presidency said in a statement. ""The key issue of the talks is an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of troops from Ukraine."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a separate statement urged Russian troops to abandon their equipment and leave the battlefield in order to save their lives, claiming that more than 4,500 Russian soldiers had already lost their lives. He also urged the European Union to give Ukraine ""immediate"" membership, via a special procedure. Russian state media posted videos of Ukrainian delegates arriving to the talks by helicopter.

Russian forces have taken over the towns of Berdyansk and Enerhodar in Ukraine's southeastern Zaporizhzhya region as well as the area around the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, Interfax quoted Russia's defence ministry as saying on Monday. The plant's operations continued normally, it said. Meanwhile, Britain's defense ministry said that Russia's advance on Kyiv has been slowed by logistical failures and fierce Ukrainian resistance. ""The bulk of [President Vladimir] Putin's ground forces remain more than 30km [18.6 miles] to the north of Kyiv their advance having been slowed by Ukrainian forces defending Hostomel airfield, a key Russian objective for day one of the conflict,"" the ministry said. ""Logistical failures and staunch Ukrainian resistance continue to frustrate the Russian advance."" The Ukrainian military also accused Russia of launching a missile strike on residential buildings in the cities of Zhytomyr and Chernigiv, cities in the country's northwest and north. ""At the same time, all attempts by the Russian invaders to achieve the goal of the military operation failed,"" the military said. ""The enemy is demoralized and bears heavy losses,"" it claimed.

And the United Nations General Assembly has adopted a resolution demanding Russia immediately stops using force against Ukraine and withdraws its military from the country.   
The historic non-binding resolution was backed by 141 out of 193 member states - with only five countries voting against. Before the vote, Ukraine's ambassador to the UN accused Russia of seeking to commit genocide in his country, and called on the world to stand together against Moscow's aggression.

The disaster area in Germany spans more than 100 kilometers near the border with the Netherlands and Belgium, where the district of Ahrweiler was the worst hit. A massive clean-up operation is underway as rescue crews search for survivors. More than a thousand people are still missing.
Destruction and debris on every corner
The only sound on the streets:  Mud being scraped away, and tractors rumbling through the once picturesque town of Ahrweiler.
In Ahrweiler the water has now subsided and it's only now the true extent of the damage caused by the floods is really coming to light. A lot of people are returning to their homes for the first time.""
The scenes are devastating for those returning. 
Volunteers, family and friends have travelled far and wide to Ahrweiler to help those affected.
They're here clearing homes, or supplying people with the basics. 
Many locals right now want financial help from the state: quickly and with as little red tape as possible.
Further north, in Erftstadt, a donation bank at a school has been overwhelmed with clothes and food.
Some locals evacuated from Erftstadt this week are also being sheltered at the school. 
Many feel left in the dark.
For many of those affected, that question could takes weeks, months...if not years to be answered.
While some German towns begin to assess the damage and clean up, others further south are being hit by new flooding. In the southeast, in Saxony, rail lines are closed due to rising waters. A state of emergency has been declared in parts of the state of Bavaria. Across the border in Austria, flooding and heavy rains are causing serious damage. 
In the town of Hallein, close to the German border, a flash flood has swept through the streets. People living there had already been warned to be careful, and avoid going into their basements.
Other parts of Europe have also been badly affected by the floods. Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated in southern parts of the Netherlands.  And Belgium is also counting the cost: At least 27 people died there. The region around the Meuse river was worst affected by what authorities are calling an ""unprecedented"" deluge of water.
The floods have receded from the streets of Pepinster -  leaving the mud behind. Residents are toiling to reclaim their homes -  hoping that the rain holds off. Days of heavy downpours turned this gentle stream into a raging torrent. 
Houses along the riverbank overwhelmed by the force of the water. Cars were swept off the roads.
Residents are in shock.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen came to take stock of the damage - and is promising long term help.
Outside assistance is welcome in Pepinster, but the community is pulling together to get through the worst. The water is on its way out. But it will be a long before things get back to normal.

Guns are being handed out to ordinary citizens and people are being urged to make petrol bombs and resist. Ukraine's military says it repelled an assault by Russian troops on army base in Kyiv. And now we're seeing some of the latest damage here.
A missile hit an apartment building located just minutes away from Kyiv's secondary international airport. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko says the strike injured 35 people, including two children. Russia's military says it has launched a barrage of cruise missiles against Ukraine.
In Kyiv, many residents have taken shelter where they can. The government has handed out thousands of guns to ordinary citizens and is urging them to build petrol bombs to resist.
And Russia has vetoed a draft UN Security Council resolution that condemned its invasion of Ukraine and called on Moscow to withdraw troops immediately. 11 countries on the 15-member council voted in favor, while India, China, and the United Arab Emirates abstained.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeated a call to Ukrainian soldiers to surrender - making baseless accusations against the Ukrainian government and invoking the name of a controversial wartime nationalist leader.
And many of those caught up in the invasion have fled to neighboring countries. The UN says more than 50,000 Ukrainian refugees have left since Thursday.
Most are headed to countries neighboring Ukraine. They include EU members Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, as well as non-EU member Moldova. As fighting worsens, these countries are bracing for more refugees in the coming days.

She said 2,717 people managed to leave Mariupol, which is under siege by Russia. Vereshchuk claimed that Russian forces had prevented humanitarian aid convoys from entering Mariupol.

Ukrainian lawmakers voted overwhelming in support of a measure to punish citizens who help Russian forces. Ukrainian collaborators could face up to 12 years in prison for ""intentional activities aimed at aiding the aggressor state,"" a statement on Ukraine's parliament website said. Collaborators could also be temporarily disbarred from government positions and their assets may be taken away. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said that the battlefront is ""practically frozen."" He said Russian forces are ""practically at a standstill"" and claimed Russian troops lack the resources to advance their offensive. Arestovych said Russian forces face shortages of fuel, ammunition and rations. He said Russia has switched its tactics from offense to defense, but this statement has not been confirmed by reports on the ground.

Ukraine's president called on the international community to help his country.

Explosions were heard in Ukraine's second-largest city Kharkiv, which lies close to Ukraine's eastern border with Russia, on Friday with the mayor telling residents to seek shelter from Russian missiles in subway stations, basements and bomb shelters, Reuters news agency reported. Air raid sirens were set off in cities across the country as reports emerged of rockets landing in residential areas.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Friday that Russia wanted to ""liberate Ukrainians from oppression,"" adding that the invading force is not planning to occupy Ukraine, Reuters reported.
The aim of the invasion, according to Lavrov, is to demilitarize Ukraine. He went on to say that Russia wants the Ukrainian people to be independent and determine their own destiny. Lavrov added that Moscow would engage in talks with Kyiv, but only after the Ukrainian military laid down its weapons. 
The Kremlin on Friday also pledged to retaliate to Western sanctions. It acknowledged that sanctions would be damaging, but that the problems they may cause would be solvable. ""It goes without saying that retaliatory measures will follow,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. ""Just how symmetrical or asymmetrical they will be depends on the analysis, the restrictions have yet to be analysed,"" he added. The comments from the Kremlin came as the EU announced that it was preparing further emergency sanctions against Russia.

24,ilfQNHaXNgE,DW News,Ukraine launches counterattacks on Russian positions | Ukraine latest,2022-03-25T09:42:26Z,25,"According to British intelligence, Ukrainian forces have succeeded in recapturing towns and defensive positions from invading Russian forces up to 35 kilometers (22 miles) east of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. A report from the British Defense Ministry on Friday said Ukrainian troops were also likely to continue pushing back Russian forces on the northwestern axis from Kyiv toward the Hostomel Airfield, some 26 kilometers from the capital. It was captured by Russian forces on February 25 at the start of Moscow's invasion. Russian forces in the south of Ukraine were still seeking to circumvent the city of Mykolaiv as they try to move in on Odesa, with fierce Ukrainian resistance and supply issues impeding their progress, according to the report.

A number of Russian military units have withdrawn behind the Russian border after suffering the loss of more than half their personnel, the Ukrainian general staff has said. According to Oleksiy Arestovych, a senior adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy, the front lines between Ukrainian and Russian troops have become ""practically frozen."" The general staff said Russian troops were continuing to blockade the large cities of Kharkiv and Sumy and also seemed to be preparing for a new offensive in Izyum in the Kharkiv region. The information cannot be independently verified.

The number of people in Germany who are in favor of Ukraine joining the EU has risen by 16% since 2018, a YouGov survey has shown. Forty-six percent of those asked would now like to see Ukraine in the bloc. The survey also showed a clear reduction in the number of people opposed to the country's EU membership, with just 30% against compared with 47% in 2018. Other countries are showing similar trends, with 42% of people in France in favor of Ukraine's EU accession (2018: 22%), 60% in Spain and 45% in Italy. The percentage of those who are undecided remains fairly high in all the countries included in the survey at 24-29%. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged that his country be quickly accepted into the bloc amid Russia's invasion and has signed a formal application. But several EU countries, including Germany, have spoken out against fast-tracking Ukraine's bid for membership.

25,FJHpWx8PKMk,DW News,Ukraine Invasion: NATO activates chemical and nuclear defense elements | Ukraine latest,2022-03-24T18:00:04Z,25,"NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the Western military alliance was concerned Russia may be preparing a pretext to use chemical weapons. ""We see the rhetoric and we see that Russia is trying to create some kind of pretext accusing Ukraine, the United States and NATO allies of preparing to use chemical and biological weapons,"" he told reporters after a NATO summit in Brussels. ""Our top military commander ... has activated NATO's chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defense elements and allies are deploying additional chemical and biological and nuclear defenses,"" he said. He reiterated the significant impact any use of chemical weapons would have on the course of events, not just in Ukraine, but also in neighboring countries. He also stressed the continuity of NATO's Open Door policy, which has been one of Moscow's main complaints and justifications for its invasion of Ukraine. Asked whether NATO would provide Ukraine with the list of weapons and equipment requested by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Stoltenberg said that alliance members are already supplying weapons and equipment, but ""at the same time, we have a responsibility to prevent this conflict from becoming a full-fledged war in Europe.""

Stoltenberg said that the alliance will increase its support for Ukraine as well as its deployments in Eastern Europe during a press conference that came after an emergency session of NATO member-state leaders. Stoltenberg's comments coincided with the release of a statement from the alliance as well as the announcement that he will stay on for an extra year due to the invasion, delaying his plan to step down from the position.
NATO members are ""equipping Ukraine with significant military supplies including anti-tank and air defense systems and drones, which are proving highly effective, as well as substantial financial and humanitarian aid,"" Stoltenberg said. ""Today we agreed to do more, including cyber security assistance and equipment to help Ukraine protect against biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear threats,"" he added. The NATO chief warned against escalating the war and pledged more support for other countries facing threats from Russia, namely Georgia and Bosnia.

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry released a statement on Thursday claiming that Russian forces have ""forcibly deported about 6,000 Mariupol residents to Russian filtration camps."" It said that Russia is also trying to do the same to the 15,000 residents in the Left Bank region of the city. ""The Russian occupiers are forcing them to move to Russia. The invaders confiscate people's passports and other identity documents,"" the statement said, adding that it was ""in order to use them as hostages and put more political pressure on Ukraine."" The statement also accused Russian forces of firing on columns of civilians fleeing from the city that was the subject of intense bombardment by the Russian military and a siege that left thousands of people without access to food, water and power for days.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on NATO to provide ""unrestricted"" military aid while speaking to representatives of the alliance over video-link. ""To save people and our cities, Ukraine needs military assistance without restrictions. In the same way that Russia is using its full arsenal without restrictions against us,"" he said. He thanked the members of the alliance for the support they have already provided, but said it was not enough. ""You can give us one percent of all your planes. One percent of your tanks. One percent!"" During the call, Zelenskyy also accused Russia of using phosphorus weapons — which ignite in contact with air and can burn for a long time as well as causing severe burns on people it comes into contact with. ""This morning, by the way, phosphorus bombs were used. Russian phosphorus bombs. Adults were killed again and children were killed again,"" Zelensky said. ""The Alliance can once more prevent the death of Ukrainians from Russian strikes, from Russian occupation, by giving us all the weapons we need.""

Ukrainian forces say Russian troops have either withdrawn or been repelled from the entire region around Kyiv. But soldiers moving into villages and towns around the capital find scores of dead civilians. 

The defence ministry says its forces have retaken more than 30 towns and villages. For weeks, battles north of the capital region kept Russian forces from advancing. But now, some of the true cost of that resistance is becoming clear, as Ukrainian soldiers and members of the Red Cross enter these locations.

Instead, the three-month-old war has exposed unexpected weaknesses in Russia's forces. Heavy troop losses are reporttedly hurting morale even more, and the war's initial aims have been severely scaled back. So  just how - and why - has Russia's army performed so badly?

UK officials see Russia closing in on Luhansk
""Russia has increased the intensity of its operations in the Donbas as it seeks to encircle Severodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne,"" the UK Ministry of Defense tweeted in In its latest intelligence update. At the same time, UK officials noted ""strong Ukrainian resistance with forces occupying well dug-in defensive positions."" ""Russia’s capture of the Severodonetsk pocket would see the whole of Luhansk Oblast placed under Russian occupation,"" they said. At the same time moving the frontline further west ""will extend Russian lines of communication and likely see its forces face further logistic resupply difficulties,"" according to the British ministry. Ex-Russian diplomat describes atmosphere in Russian Foreign Ministry Boris Bondarev, who until Monday was listed as the Counsellor to the UN at Russia's mission in Geneva, warned that his Russian colleagues were growing nonchalant when considering nuclear weapons' use. ""They think that if you hit some village in America with a nuclear strike, then the Americans will immediately get scared and run to beg for mercy on their knees,"" Bondarev told the The New York Times. ""That’s how many of our people think, and I fear that this is the line that they are passing along to Moscow,"" he added. Bondarev's job in Switzerland was focused mainly on arms control and disarmament issues.

The Russian-backed head of the military-civilian administration of occupied Melitopol, Galina Danilchenko, said that rubles will be the accepted in the Zaporizhzhia region, according to an interview cited by Russian state-run RIA news agency. Danilchenko noted that residents would be expected to exchange Ukrainian hryvnias for Russian currency. ""You can pay with rubles for all the services of enterprises, purchase raw materials for the production of your own products, ship products to the buyer and receive ruble proceeds to your current account,"" she said.

Eight missiles are believed to have been fired at Ukraine's Center for International Peacekeeping and Security, according to Lviv's Regional Military Administration on Telegram. The center is located in Yavoriv, not far from the Polish border and some 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Lviv. Lviv regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy said on Telegram that 35 people have died in the strike and a further 134 were injured. The strike on the military base could possibly be a Russian message intended for NATO. The US and other NATO countries previously conducted training exercises with the Ukrainian military at the center called Rapid Trident 21, according to the US Army website. A Ukrainian general cited by the US army website said the Rapid Trident 21 exercises held at the Yavoriv center were ""not just another stage of military skills improvement, but also an important step towards Ukraine's European integration."" Ukraine's defense minister said in a tweet that ""foreign instructors"" work at the training center. A NATO official told Reuters news agency that there were no alliance personnel at the base. The mayor of Ivano-Frankivsk, Ruslan Martsinkiv, said on Facebook that the western Ukrainian city's airport was also targeted in an attack early Sunday. 

A Russian airstrike in the southern city of Mykolaiv near Odesa left nine people dead, according to regional governor Vitaliy Kim. Mykolaiv serves as an important transportation hub within Ukraine.

The mayor of Dniprodrudne, Yevheniy Matvieyev, was kidnapped by Russian forces, according to Ukrainian officials such as Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. Dniprorudne has around 20,000 inhabitants. Earlier, Russian troops kidnapped Melitopol Ivan Federov on Friday, Ukraine's parliament said.

Ukraine's border guard has said that males aged 18-60 are not allowed to leave the country in a statement posted on its Facebook account. The border guard said that this restriction will last for the duration of the period of martial law in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared martial law earlier on Thursday shortly after it was reported that Russia had attacked Ukraine.

Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar has warned that Russian forces are poised to enter areas just outside the capital, Kyiv, on Friday. A government adviser, Anton Herashchenko, said the Russian troops planned to break through into the capital using tanks but that Ukrainian forces were ready to counter the attack with anti-tank missiles supplied by foreign allies.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had earlier said the government had information that ""subversive groups"" were moving on the city. This comes after a night of reported air raids in the city that were said by a DW correspondent to have set some residential buildings on fire. Many Kyiv residents have taken shelter in underground metro stations.

The Ukrainian general staff of the armed forces said Ukrainian troops were firmly resisting what he called ""Russian occupiers"" in the Kyiv area. Ukrainian airborne assault troops were reported in a statement to have stopped ""overwhelming enemy forces"" at the Teteriv River near the settlements of Dymer and Ivankiv, northwest of the capital. The statement said a bridge over the river was destroyed. ""The hardest day will be today. The enemy's plan is to break through with tank columns from the side of Ivankiv and Chernihiv to Kyiv,'' Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said on Telegram.

Here's a look at the most significant developments from today and how the situation unfolded: 

In an unscheduled television address on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that he ""decided to conduct a special military operation."" Putin claimed the ""operation"" was to ""protect people who have been subjected to bullying and genocide ... for the last eight years,"" or since 2014, when Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea. Moscow-backed separatists have fought the government's forces in eastern Ukraine ever since. 

The Russian government claimed hours earlier that separatist leaders had requested military help to fend off what they called Ukrainian ""aggression."" Putin said, ""We will strive for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine."" At an emergency UN Security Council meeting, Russia's envoy Vassily Nebenzia said the ""operation"" was targeting ""the junta"" in power in Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was elected to office in an election in 2019.

Air raid sirens sounded over the Ukrainian capital at the break of dawn.  The Ukrainian leadership said at least 40 soldiers had been killed so far by Russian airstrikes. Zelenskyy declared martial law and said Russia was attacking his country's ""military infrastructure."" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said, ""Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes."" ""This is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now,"" he added. Ukraine's border guard reported that Russian tanks entered Ukraine in the Luhansk region and Crimea. Russia's Defense Ministry said it had neutralized Ukrainian military airbases and air defense systems.

A follow-on round will take place in the coming days. Both delegations will return to their respective capitals for further consultations. 

Meanwhile the United Nations’ General Assembly met Monday for the first emergency session in decades. Nebenzya, Russia's ambassador to the UN, told the General Assembly that ""for us, Ukraine joining NATO is a red line."" Nebenzya laid the blame for the Russian invasion on Ukraine, saying that Kyiv had failed to stick to the Minsk agreement as well as claiming that Ukrainian forces carried out provocations against people in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014. Nebenzya also accused Ukraine's western partners, especially the US, of ""inciting Kyiv, egging it on, repeating the senseless mantra that their obligations to the Minsk agreements are not being complied with by the Russian Federation.""

Sergiy Kyslytsya, Ukraine's ambassador to the UN, warned the members of UN General Assembly of the consequences of Russia's invasion.
""Russia uses all its military potential to attack Ukraine and has begun redeploying reserve units on the border,"" he said. He also accused the Russian force of attacking civilian infrastructure as well as kindergartens and hospitals, which he called war crimes.

33,sOUKc7KgJiU,DW News,"Ukraine forces push Russians out of Kharkiv as NATO, G7 hold talks on war | Ukraine Update",2022-05-14T10:05:17Z,25,"Russia's war on Ukraine is in the spotlight at high-level diplomatic talks in Germany. Foreign ministers from NATO countries are meeting over their long-term strategy. Ministers from Finland and Sweden are expected to meet their Turkish counterpart there, after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan indicated he may resist their bid to join the military alliance.
Meanwhile foreign ministers from Group of Seven nations are continuing their talks. They've pledged to support Ukraine ""until victory."" The spotlight there has been on food security concerns, with global supplies from Ukraine hit by Russian blockades.
German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who is hosting the G-7 meeting, said Russia was waging a ""food war"" on the world.
Ukrainian forces appear close to claiming victory over Russia's attempt to take the second largest city, Kharkiv. Western military analysts said Russian troops were withdrawing from areas around the city due to limited reinforcements and Ukrainian counterattacks. Despite the latest gains, President Volodomyr Zelenskyy used his nightly address to warn of a long war ahead. He said more than 1,000 settlements had now been deoccupied.
A Russian soldier has gone on trial in Kyiv, accused of committing war crimes during the first weeks of the invasion of Ukraine. The 21-year old is alleged to have shot an unarmed civilian in a car. It's the first trial of its kind, with Ukrainian prosecutors preparing cases against at least forty other soldiers and investigating thousands more possible war crimes.
Ukrainian and British officials say Russian forces have suffered heavy losses trying to cross a river in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine. Kyiv has released video it says shows the aftermath of a strike on a Russian pontoon bridge. Britain's defense ministry said Russia lost what it described as ""significant armored maneuver elements"" in the attack earlier this week.
Sweden's foreign minister says her country's accession to NATO would prevent conflicts in northern Europe. Ann Linde was presenting a parliamentary report on security as Sweden considers applying to join the alliance, in the face of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

This is part of a package worth $200 million, promised to Kiev last week by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The initial delivery includes defensive weapons and ammunition as the country prepares for possible Russian aggression. Such a form of deterrence is not endorsed by Germany, which has refused to supply weapons to Ukraine. The Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba says he's disappointed in Germany.
Moscow has deployed some 100,000 troops along its border with Ukraine, but insists it has no plans to launch an attack.

35,zjWaXog1xDU,DW News,Ukraine says it repelled Russian forces at battle in Kyiv suburbs | Ukraine latest,2022-03-22T08:26:48Z,25,"Ukraine claims it has retaken strategically important Kyiv suburb. The Ukrainian military said its troops have driven Russian forces out of Makariv, a town about 60 kilometers (37 miles) west of Kyiv. 
The strategically important town was the scene of a fierce battle and has sustained significant damage from Russian shelling, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said, adding its recapture prevents Russian forces from encircling the capital from the northwest. The ""state flag of Ukraine was raised over the city of Makariv"" as the Russians retreated, the ministry wrote in a post on Facebook. DW could not confirm the claim by the Ukraine forces.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine was willing to consider dropping its demands for full NATO membership in exchange for security guarantees. ""It's a compromise for everyone: for the West, which doesn't know what to do with us with regard to NATO, for Ukraine, which wants security guarantees, and for Russia, which doesn't want further NATO expansion,"" Zelenskyy said late Monday in an interview with Ukrainian television channels. Ukraine is well aware it cannot be admitted to NATO at the moment because they ""do not want to fight with Russia,"" Zelenskyy said, adding, ""Okay, what other security guarantees are possible?"" Zelenskyy was adamant that he needed to talk to Russian President Vladimir Putinin order to understand whether Russia even intends to stop the war. Putin has so far ignored Zelenskyy repeated requests for direct talks. On Monday, Zelenskyy said again that he is ready to meet Putin ""in any format"" but would also not bow to ultimatums from Russia to surrender. The president also suggested that after a cease-fire agreement, Kyiv would be ready to discuss the status of Crimea and the eastern Donbas region held by Russian-backed separatists. However, Zelenskyy said he plans to put any agreements reached with Russia to a nationwide referendum for public approval.

Russia's Foreign Ministry says it has withdrawn from peace treaty negotiations with Japan, as a result of  sanctions imposed by Tokyo over the invasion of Ukraine. ""Under the current conditions Russia does not intend to continue negotiations with Japan on a peace treaty,"" the foreign ministry said and cited Japan's ""openly unfriendly positions and attempts to damage the interests of our country."" Last week Japan announced plans to revoke Moscow's trade status and expand freezing of assets against Russian individuals. Russia and Japan have not officially ended World War II hostilities due to a dispute over islands north of Hokkaido. And Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida hit back at Russia's decision to withdraw from the peace treaty. ""The latest situation occurred as a result of Russia's aggression against Ukraine, and Russia's attempt to shift the issue to Japan-Russia relations is extremely unjustified and absolutely unacceptable,"" he said in parliament. Japan ""strongly protests,"" he added, condemning Russia for its actions to ""unilaterally change the status quo by force.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said again that he is ready to meet Russian leader Vladimir Putin ""in any format"" but would also not bow to ultimatums from Russia to surrender. Russian publication Komsomolskaya Pravda briefly published a casualty figure of nearly 10,000 deaths of Russian soldiers since the invasion of Ukraine on February 24 began, but then deleted it. US President Joe Biden says Vladimir Putin is considering the use of biological and chemical weapons as a false flag attack, based on US intelligence assessments. The Pentagon has accused Russian forces of committing war crimes in Ukraine and said it would help gather evidence of them. The European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Monday that Russia's attacks on the Ukrainian coastal city of Mariupol amount to a ""war crime."" German Christian Democratic Union (CDU) lawmaker Michael Brand called for sanctions against former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder over his strong links with Russia. Humanitarian organization Save the Children said upwards of 6 million children are in imminent danger as a growing number of hospitals and schools come under attack during Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. A Moscow court ruled in favor of Russia's FSB intelligence services on Monday, agreeing to label the US internet giant Meta (formerly Facebook) an ""extremist organization.""

36,QrBP3sydgXg,DW News,Russian forces take control over Europe's largest nuclear power plant | DW News,2022-03-04T07:55:48Z,25,"Russian forces have entered the site of Europe's largest nuclear power plant after a fire broke out there during Russian shelling. Ukrainian authorities say no radiation leaks have been detected.

Ukrainian authorities say Russian forces have taken control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the countries southeast. A fire broke out at one of the reactors at the site after Russian shelling overnight. ""Operational personnel are monitoring the condition of power units,"" the regional authority said on social media. It added that it sought to ensure the operations were in line with safety requirements.

Russian authorities have moved to restrict access to a number of international media websites, including that of Deutsche Welle, that they accuse of providing false information about Russia's attack on Ukraine. Websites of the BBC, the independent news website Meduza and the Russian-language website of the US-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Svoboda, were also ""limited"" following a request from prosecutors, according to Russian media watchdog Roskomnadzor. Deutsche Welle has been able to confirm that access to its website from Russia has been blocked since early Friday morning, and that its services can be used only by employing a VPN or circumvention tool.

The Ukrainian Embassy in Berlin has requested the German government provide Kyiv with tanks and warships to face down a Russian invasion. Additional items on Ukraine's list of requests include infantry fighting vehicles, artillery systems, such as self-propelled howitzers, air defense systems, combat and support helicopters, reconnaissance and combat drones and transport aircraft. Ukraine's formal request to the Chancellery, the Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry read in part, ""In view of the extremely tense security situation because of the ongoing Russian aggression, the Ukrainian government is seeking that this request be processed and favorably reviewed as quickly as possible."" The note adds Putin started a ""war of annihilation"" against Ukraine. Berlin reversed its defense and Russia policy of many decades seemingly overnight following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Germany has already provided 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger surface-to-air missiles after initially promising just 5,000 helmets.

Earlier, Ukraine's armed forces command said Russia's main efforts were focused on establishing complete control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, with military action also intensifying in Kharkiv.

Previously, Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said seven civilians were killed in overnight missile strikes. The city has been considered a safe haven as it is relatively less affected by the fighting than other parts of Ukraine. Reporting from Lviv, DW correspondent Emmanuelle Shaze said there was ""infrastructure"" in the city that would be of interest to Russian forces.

More than 10,000 civilians have been killed in the weeks-long bombardment. Moscow estimates around 2,500 Ukrainian soldiers are holding out at a huge steel plant. Russia's defense ministry says it will destroy those who continue to resist. Ukraine's prime minister says the city has not fallen, and its forces will fight to the end.
But Russia has taken significant losses in its war against Ukraine, including a third of its generals, most recently General Vladimir Frolov, and its Black Sea flagship, the Moskva. DW spoke with former military intelligence officer Frank Ledwidge about what this says about Russia's military and its leadership.

40,9x_frrL8Pas,DW News,Economy in crisis: Russia hit hard by international sanctions | DW News,2022-02-28T15:16:20Z,25,"Russia's escalating war in Ukraine has prompted unprecedented economic sanctions against the country. Over the weekend, Russian banks were further cut off from the international financial system. Some have been excluded from the SWIFT payments system while moves have been made to stop the Russian central bank using its $630 billion (€562 billion) of foreign reserves. The sanctions are by far the most severe to have been leveled at Russia since the country invaded Ukraine last week. The country's increasing financial and political isolation is already causing significant consequences for the economy, the 11th-largest in the world by GDP.

Russia's currency, the ruble, fell by around 30% to record lows after the latest sanctions, although it did recover a little in recent hours. That compounds massive losses already experienced last week. In response, the Russian central bank has made an emergency decision to hike interest rates from 9.5% to 20%. The bank has also temporarily blocked the sale of securities held by foreigners. The currency collapse has led to long lines outside ATMs across Russia, with fears rising over further plunges in the value of the ruble. On Monday, the central bank announced that the Moscow Stock Exchange would not open. It also said in a statement that it has increased interest rates to support ""financial and price stability and protect the savings of citizens from depreciation.""

The Kremlin is seeking to capture the industrial Donbas region, but many observers say that Russian gains are smaller than expected. Ukraine has admitted heavy losses in the east, but says Russian casualties are far higher. Evidence of Russian brutality under Vladimir Putin has shocked western officials - even those with military backgrounds.
On March 4th, eight days after Russia invaded Ukraine, Russian forces took control of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. The Russians have kept the Zaporizhzhia plant running – with Ukrainian staff. But there have been reports of Russian troops forcing engineers to work under extreme pressure. 
There are also concerns that fighting near the plant has caused damage or could cause a nuclear accident. Ukraine says Russia sent eight specialists from its state nuclear company to the plant, where they demanded managers give them confidential data about its operation. The head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, has urged international nuclear specialists be granted access to the plant as soon as possible.
And Russia has been relentlessly bombarding Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-biggest city, for weeks. Most people there have left, but many remain.

The Ukrainian military claims to have driven Russian troops out of the area around the country's second-largest city. The shelling, according to regional authorities, has stopped. But Ukraine's president says his forces elsewhere still lack the means to tip the scales in their favor. Volodomyr Zelenskyy told a visiting U.S. Senate delegation he needs more powerful weapons. 
And in a victory on stage, the Ukrainian band Kalush Orchestra has won the Eurovision Song Contest. The group was a favorite going into the final round with their song Stefania, which blends traditional folk music with modern-day hip-hop. The band was in fourth place after the jury voted, but swept to victory thanks to overwhelming support from fans across Europe.  
Usually, Ukrainian TV would broadcast the competition from a studio in Kyiv. But after the war broke out, producers moved the broadcast to a secret location underground. DW correspondent Amien Essif joined the crew on what was to be a very special night.
Foreign ministers from NATO countries are in Berlin for talks dominated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Representatives from Sweden and Finland are ALSO in town to discuss their intentions to gain membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But not all NATO members are keen to let the Scandinavian countries become part of the defense alliance.

48,f9TBvq_ZqBc,DW News,Russia claims 'first stage' of Ukraine war is a success | DW News,2022-03-26T10:00:24Z,25,"While Russia says its invasion of Ukraine has entered a new phase, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated his call for peace talks with Russia to end the war. Zelenskyy has called on energy-rich countries to increase their output to prevent Moscow from using its oil and gas supplies to ""blackmail"" other nations. Zelenskyy also noted that Muslims in Ukraine would have to fight during the upcoming holy fasting month of Ramadan. ""We have to ensure this sacred month of Ramadan is not overshadowed by the misery of people in Ukraine,'' he said. Zelenskyy made the comments during a surprise video appearance at the Doha Forum in Qatar, a leading exporter of natural gas. He told the international conference that no country was safeguarded from the shocks triggered by disruptions to food supply as a result of Russia's invasion. ""They are destroying our ports,'' Zelenskyy said. ""The absence of exports from Ukraine will deal a blow to countries worldwide.'' ""The future of Europe rests with your efforts,'' he added.

The latest intelligence report from the UK's Ministry of Defense has warned that Russia will likely continue to ""use its heavy firepower on urban areas as it looks to limit its own already considerable losses."" In over a month of fighting, Russian troops have failed to capture and hold onto any major Ukrainian city, although a number of major centers, including Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol remain under siege. The intelligence report said Russian forces were mainly relying on the indiscriminate use of air and artillery bombardments ""in an attempt to demoralize defending forces,"" rather than large-scale infantry operations inside cities. This strategy would come ""at the cost of further civilian casualties,"" the report added.

The office of Ukraine's prosecutor general says the war in Ukraine has killed 136 children since Russia invaded its neighbor a little over a month ago. The death toll was posted in a message on the Telegram app and on Facebook. It said 64 of those children were killed in the Kyiv region. A further 50 died in the Donetsk region in the country's east, it added. Around 200 children have been injured, the prosecutor's office said. The figures have not been independently verified.

Russia has said its invasion of Ukraine has entered a new phase, one signal it may be scaling back its ambitions. Moscow has suffered a series of setbacks and defeats at the hands of the Ukrainian army and Ukrainians fighting against the Russian invasion. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated his call for peace talks with Russia to end the war, but he stressed that Ukraine would not give up territory. In his nightly video address to the Ukrainian people, Zelenskyy may have been responding to Russian Colonel General Sergei Rudskoi, the deputy chief of the Russian general staff. Rudskoi said Russian forces would focus on ""the main goal, the liberation of Donbas."" Dozens of Ukrainian officials, journalists and activists have been detained or kidnapped by Russian forces, the United Nations has warned. Matilda Bogner, the head of the UN rights team in Ukraine, said human rights monitors have been receiving ever more information on mass graves in the besieged port city of Mariupol. UK intelligence reports Russian forces have been pushed back to 35 kilometers east of Kyiv. The Pentagon said the city of Kherson was again ""contested"" as Ukrainian forces launched a counteroffensive. However, Ukraine's air force said the headquarters in Vinnytsia in the western part of the country was hit by numerous Russian cruise missiles Friday afternoon. Western officials said a seventh Russian general has been killed since the war in Ukraine began. Lt. Gen. Yakov Rezanstev, commander of Russia's 49th Combined Arms Army in the southern military district, was killed most recently.
