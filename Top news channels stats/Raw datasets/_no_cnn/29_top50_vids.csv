10,adccBN1y3E0,Washington Post,"She gets paid to be her paralyzed boyfriend’s caregiver, but marriage could change that",2021-08-09T15:49:12Z,25,"Over a year ago Jane Morgan and Conner Slevin's life changed when Conner was hit by a wave in the ocean on a trip to Mexico. It left him paralyzed. Now, his girlfriend Jane is his sole caregiver, taking care of his long list of medical needs. Living in Oregon, the state pays Jane minimum wage for forty hours of care a week. Before the accident, Conner was planning to propose. But if they marry, Jane's payments for caregiving will get reduced. 

Who gets paid to be a caregiver is complicated. Medicaid, Medicare and private insurance companies have different rules and requirements for paying family members, as do individual states — and in most states, married caregivers are not counted as workers. Only eight state Medicaid programs allow married people to be paid caregivers to their partners. Eight additional states have private programs that allow spouses to be paid as caregivers.

But across much of the country, interabled couples, a relationship with one person who is disabled and one who is able-bodied, are placed in a terrible predicament: marriage or compensation for the grueling work of managing one of the most expensive medical conditions.

11,ibWJO02nNsY,Washington Post,Inside the U.S. Capitol at the height of the siege | Visual Forensics,2021-01-17T01:45:03Z,25,"At 2:12 p.m. on Jan. 6, supporters of President Trump began climbing through a window they had smashed on the northwest side of the U.S. Capitol. “Go! Go! Go!” someone shouted as the rioters, some in military gear, streamed in. It was the start of the most serious attack on the Capitol since the War of 1812. The mob coursed through the building, enraged that Congress was preparing to make Trump’s electoral defeat official. “Drag them out! … Hang them out!” rioters yelled at one point, as they gathered near the House chamber.

Officials in the House and Senate secured the doors of their respective chambers, but lawmakers were soon forced to retreat to undisclosed locations. Five people died on the grounds that day, including a Capitol police officer. In all, more than 50 officers were injured.

To reconstruct the pandemonium inside the Capitol, The Washington Post examined text messages, photos and hundreds of videos, some of which were exclusively obtained. By synchronizing the footage and locating some of the camera angles within a digital 3-D model of the building, The Post was able to map the rioters’ movements and assess how close they came to lawmakers — in some cases feet apart or separated only by a handful of vastly outnumbered police officers.

12,LGXwJnZSIkQ,Washington Post,Most of the dead Astroworld Festival victims were in one highly packed area | Visual Forensics,2021-11-24T13:00:08Z,25,"UPDATE: After this video was published, The Post determined Bharti Shahani, another victim, was also in the south quadrant when the concert began, according to a video she took that was obtained by The Post. In an interview, Shahani's sister, who was with her at the concert, confirmed the location. 

The Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences announced on Dec. 16 that all 10 deaths were due to compression asphyxia, meaning the victims were squeezed so tightly that they lost their ability to draw a breath.

***

At least seven of the 10 dead after Travis Scott's Astroworld Festival were clustered in a small area enclosed on three sides by metal barriers that became dangerously crowded, according to a Washington Post investigation. The review — based on dozens of videos examined for when and where each was taken, interviews with witnesses, and an analysis by crowd experts — reveals how a crowd surge at a performance by Scott turned one pocket of the audience into an epicenter of chaos and distress.

Ten fans at the Nov. 5 concert in Houston died and dozens more were injured, making it one of the most deadly concerts in the nation’s history. The Post found that most of those who died were close to each other in the viewing area’s south quadrant, where witnesses described people collapsing under the pressure of the crowd. Three concertgoers who died appeared unconscious in a pile of other fallen fans in the south quadrant only 16 minutes into the show, according to a video reviewed by The Post. The concert continued for nearly another hour. In parts of the tightly compressed area where many of the dead were concentrated, there were as little as 1.85 square feet per person, according to an analysis done by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University for The Post. At that density, people are amid a crowd that is at risk of dangerously collapsing in on itself, two crowd science experts said.

The Post’s reconstruction of the night’s events, including details evident in exclusively obtained videos, also underscores unanswered questions about how long the concert was allowed to continue after fans already were pleading for help and receiving emergency care.

13,_EQfUbE4bL8,Washington Post,LIVE COVERAGE | Mob storms the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6th 2021,2021-01-07T11:04:33Z,25,"Protesters pressed past police and broke into the U.S. Capitol as Congress met in a joint session on Jan. 6 to count each state’s electoral votes and confirm President-elect Joe Biden as the winner. As many as three dozen congressional Republicans were expected to launch a final challenge to the results of the 2020 presidential election.

It has become routine after recent elections for House lawmakers on the losing side to put up a symbolic fight over the results, which they can do under an 1880s law governing the process. It has been less common for senators to join them, but this time a dozen will. Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) will lead the challenge of the votes and call for an “emergency audit” to investigate baseless fraud allegations.

The Post’s Libby Casey will anchor live coverage, featuring reporters Aaron Blake, Rhonda Colvin, James Hohmann and Amber Phillips. Read more: https://wapo.st/3ohQZCg. Read more: https://wapo.st/3ohQZCg. Subscribe to The Washington Post on YouTube: https://wapo.st/2QOdcqK

43,loCNxNJkbk0,Washington Post,Third day of Trump’s impeachment trial - 2/11 (FULL LIVE STREAM),2021-02-11T22:34:59Z,25,"Former president Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial will continue on Feb. 11. He is accused of “incitement of insurrection” after the deadly Capitol riot. 

House managers have argued that the attack was “predictable” and “foreseeable” because of the former president’s provocations, including tweets and speeches that were displayed as part of their presentation. Unseen security footage presented by managers also showed the following:

- Vice President Pence and his family being rushed from the Senate chamber
- Rioters chanting and searching for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)
- Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) running in the opposite direction of the rioters

The Post’s Libby Casey will anchor live coverage of the trial and be joined by reporters Rhonda Colvin, Joyce Koh, Nicole Ellis, Hannah Jewell and James Hohmann. Read more: https://wapo.st/3rK6XGC. Subscribe to The Washington Post on YouTube: https://wapo.st/2QOdcqK
