There's a long-held myth that cracking your knuckles can damage your hands. The sound definitely might make people around you cringe, but what's making those noises, and is it actually bad for you?

There's a space in your joints filled with synovial fluid, a liquid that reduces the friction in your joints when you move. It contains gases (oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide).

When you pop a joint, you stretch out that space between the bones. That expanding space creates negative pressure, like a vacuum, that sucks in the synovial fluid. It forms bubbles, which then collapse, and that's what you hear.

Most medical sources agree that unless you experience pain when you pop your joints, you're probably fine to keep doing it. Researchers (including one man who cracked his knuckles on just one hand for 60 years) haven't established a connection between cracking your knuckles and arthritis.

One 1990 study of 300 people did find that cracking knuckles over a long period of time led to hand swelling and decreased grip strength, but there hasn't been any follow-up research on that.

Vestigial structures are evolution's leftovers ‚Äî body parts that, through inheritance, have outlived the context in which they arose. Some of the most delightful reminders of the common ancestry we share with other animals, they show that the building blocks of the human body predate our species by hundreds of millions of years.

Forty-two percent of Americans say that humans were created in their present form within the past 10,000 years ‚Äî a percentage that hasn't changed much since 1982, when Gallup started polling views on evolution.

Several lines of evidence, from the fossil record, comparative anatomy, and genetics, tell another story. But you don't have to read all the research to find signs of our evolutionary history ‚Äî you can see it in the vestigial structures in each of our bodies, like the third molars that no longer fit in our mouths. For a few other examples, check out the video above.

2,QMbHLF_zwjs,Vox,Why no aquarium has a great white shark,2016-07-08T13:52:58Z,25,"Many have tried to keep a white shark in captivity. Here's why that's so difficult.

‚úâÔ∏è Sign up for our newsletter: http://www.vox.com/video-newsletter

There are several aquariums around the world, including one in Georgia, that house whale sharks, the biggest fish in the sea. But not one has a great white shark on display. 

Aquariums have made dozens of attempts since the 1970s to display a captive great white shark. Most of those attempts ended with dead sharks. 

By the 2000s, the only group still trying was the Monterey Bay Aquarium, which spent a decade planning its white shark program. In 2004, it acquired a shark that became the first great white to survive in captivity for more than 16 days. In fact, it was on display for more than six months before it was released back into the ocean. 

In the following years, the Monterey Bay Aquarium hosted five more juvenile white sharks for temporary stays before ending the program in 2011. It was an expensive effort and had come under criticism due to injuries that some of the sharks developed in the tank. 

Responding to those critics, Jon Hoech, the aquarium's director of husbandry operations, said: ""We believe strongly that putting people face to face with live animals like this is very significant in inspiring ocean conservation and connecting people to the ocean environment. We feel like white sharks face a significant threats out in the wild and our ability to bring awareness to that is significant in terms of encouraging people to become ocean stewards."" 

Check out the video above to learn why white sharks are so difficult to keep in captivity and how the Monterey Bay Aquarium designed a program that could keep them alive.

3,TPpoJGYlW54,Vox,How wildlife trade is linked to coronavirus,2020-03-06T13:00:04Z,25,"And why the disease first appeared in China.

NOTE: As our expert Peter Li points out in the video, ‚ÄúThe majority of the people in China do not eat wildlife animals. Those people who consume these wildlife animals are the rich and the powerful ‚Äìa small minority.‚Äù  This video explains how the people of China are themselves victims of the conditions that led to coronavirus. The virus is affecting many different countries and cultures, and there is never justification for xenophobia or racism.

As of early March 2020, a new coronavirus, called COVID-19, is in more than 70 countries and has killed more than 3,100 people, the vast majority in China. That's where the virus emerged back in December 2019. This isn't a new phenomenon for China; in 2003, the SARS virus also emerged there, and under similar circumstances, before spreading around the world and killing nearly 800.

Both SARS and COVID-19 are in the ""coronavirus"" family, and both appear to have emerged from animals in China's notorious wildlife markets. Experts had long predicted that these markets, known to be potential sources of disease, would enable another outbreak. The markets, and the wildlife trade that supports them, are the underlying problem of these pandemics; until China solves that problem, more are likely to emerge.

Hong Kong is the most expensive housing market in the world. It has been ranked as the least affordable housing market on Earth for eight years in a row, and the price per square foot seems to be only going up. The inflated prices are forcing Hongkongers to squeeze into unconventionally small spaces that can affect their quality of life. 

Tens of thousands of Hongkongers are living in spaces that range from 75 to 140 square feet. To put that in perspective, the average parking space in the US is about 150 square feet. And in the most extreme cases, Hongkongers have resorted to homes the size of a coffin. 

I spent some time exploring the living situation in Hong Kong to find out why housing has become so expensive and spaces so tight. 

To understand how Hong Kong‚Äôs housing market turned out this way and see how it‚Äôs affecting people‚Äôs lives, watch the final episode of Borders Hong Kong.

Maps are flat representations of our spherical planet. Johnny Harris cut open a plastic globe to understand just what it takes to turn a sphere into something flat.

His struggle to make a flat map out of the plastic globe is indicative of a challenge mapmakers have faced for centuries: It is mathematically impossible to translate the surface of a sphere onto a plane without some form of distortion.

To solve this problem, mathematicians and cartographers have developed a huge library of representations of the globe, each distorting a certain attribute and preserving others.

For instance, the Mercator projection preserves the shape of countries while distorting the size, especially near the north and south pole.

For a more accurate view of land area look at the Gall-Peters projection, which preserves area while distorting shape.

In the end, there's not ""right"" map projection. Each comes with trade-offs, and cartographers make projection decisions based on the particular tasks at hand. But if you are interested in seeing an accurate depiction of the planet, it's best to stick with a globe.

Vladimir Putin has been ruling Russia since 1999. In that time he has shaped the country into an authoritarian and militaristic society. The Soviet Union dissolved into 15 new countries, including the new Russian Federation. In Putin‚Äôs eyes, Russia had just lost 2 million square miles of territory. But Putin‚Äôs regime has also developed and fostered the most effect cyber hacker army in the world and he‚Äôs used it to wreak havoc in the West. But the election of Donald Trump brings new hope for the Putin vision. Trump‚Äôs rhetoric has been notably soft on Russia. He could lift sanctions and weaken NATO, potentially freeing up space for Putin‚Äôs Russia to become a dominant power once again.

One of the biggest myths about the Israel-Palestine conflict is that it's been going on for centuries, that this is all about ancient religious hatreds.

In fact, while religion is involved, the conflict is mostly about two groups of people who claim the same land. And it really only goes back about a century, to the early 1900s. At its heart, it is a conflict between two self-determination movements ‚Äî the Jewish Zionist project and the Palestinian nationalist project ‚Äî that lay claim to the same territory.

14,luTPMHC7zHY,Vox,Why China is building islands in the South China Sea,2017-02-17T13:16:38Z,25,"China claims they aren't military bases, but their actions say otherwise. 

Join the Vox Video Lab: http://bit.ly/video-lab

Since 2014, China has been building islands in the middle of the South China Sea. What were once underwater reefs are now sandy islands complete with airfields, roads, buildings, and missile systems. In less than two years, China has turned seven reefs into seven military bases in the South China Sea, one of the most contentious bodies of water in the world.

The sea is one of the most important areas of ocean in the world. It‚Äôs estimated to hold 11 billion barrels of oil, 109 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 10 percent of the world‚Äôs fisheries. Most importantly, 30 percent of the world‚Äôs shipping trade flows through the South China Sea to the busy ports of Southeast Asia. It‚Äôs an incredibly important strategic area, and five countries currently claim some part of it.

Most countries base their claims off the United Nations Law of the Seas, which says a country‚Äôs territory extends 200 miles off its shores, an area called the exclusive economic zone, or EEZ. Any trade or resources that fall in a country‚Äôs EEZ belong to that country; they‚Äôre its sovereign territory. Any area that is not in an EEZ is considered international waters and subject to UN maritime law, meaning it‚Äôs shared by everyone. Every country in the region, which includes Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, and Vietnam, bases its claim to the South China Sea on the UN‚Äôs EEZ laws ‚Äî except China.

China argues it has a historical claim to the South China Sea, dating back to naval expeditions in the 15th century. After World War II, the Japanese Empire lost control of the South China Sea, and China took advantage of the moment to reclaim it. On maps, it started drawing a dashed line that encompassed most of the South China Sea. This line became its official claim and is known today as the Nine-Dash Line, because it always has nine dashes. In 1973, when the UN law established EEZs, China reaffirmed its Nine-Dash Line, refusing to clarify the line‚Äôs boundaries and rejecting other countries‚Äô claims.

Since then, tensions have built around who rightfully owns the South China Sea. The dispute has centered on the Spratly Islands, an archipelago at the heart of the South China Sea. Currently, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam claim some part of the Spratly Island chain. They‚Äôve asserted their claims by putting small buildings, ports, and even some people on what are essentially rocks in the middle of the ocean.

But the Spratlys are very important, because whichever country can successfully claim them can extend its EEZ to include them, thus gaining miles of precious sovereign territory. This is why China began building up islands in 2014. By turning these rocks into military bases, the Chinese are now able to support hundreds of ships, bolstering their presence in the region. They are using fishing boats, surveillance ships, and navy destroyers to set up blockades around other countries‚Äô islands and defend their own. This is all done very cautiously and in small steps in order to avoid sparking a wider conflict.

Since China began building islands, the disputes have not become violent. But tensions are building in the region. As China deploys more of its military to the Spratlys, other countries are getting nervous and building up their own islands. It‚Äôs a complex situation that will continue to gain international attention, for better or for worse.

15,TVe5XPU10Zc,Vox,How fan films shaped The Lego Movie,2017-06-15T13:07:45Z,25,"The 2014 film was an animation feat ‚Äî¬†but it was built on the legacy of homemade fan movies. 

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

When you watch installments of the Warner Bros. line of Lego movies, it's hard not to be struck by how realistic the animation is. It isn't quite traditional stop motion ‚Äî but it sure looks as if it could be. That's largely thanks to the work of the animators at Animal Logic, a Sydney-based visual effects studio that has worked on The Lego Movie, The Lego Batman Movie, and the upcoming The Lego Ninjago Movie. Powered by live action filming techniques and a close attention to detail, the studio has helped reinvent what Lego animations can look like. But they owe a lot of that aesthetic to the influence of fan films. Since the early 1970s, enthusiasts have made home movies with their own Lego sets. They're called Brickfilms ‚Äî¬†and they've grown into a sizable community producing great movies and helping many young animators get their start. The Lego Movie animators learned from what made those home movies so good by embracing the limitations of the medium, and creating a world that anyone could could rebuild at home. 

Check out some of the Brickfilms we showed in this video:

UPDATE: Watch our 2020 follow-up interview with Gates: https://youtu.be/jLbJayQygzw

There's something out there that's as bad as war, something that kills as many people as war, and Bill Gates doesn't think we're ready for it.

""Look at the death chart of the 20th century,"" he says, because he's the kind of guy that looks at death charts. ""I think everybody would say there must be a spike for World War I. Sure enough, there it is, like 25 million. And there must be a big spike for World War II, and there it is, it's like 65 million. But then you'll see this other spike that is as large as World War II right after World War I, and most people, would say, 'What was that?'""

""Well, that was the Spanish flu.""

In a 1990 paper on ""The Anthropology of Infectious Disease,"" Marcia Inhorn and Peter Brown estimated that infectious diseases ""have likely claimed more lives than all wars, noninfectious diseases, and natural disasters put together."" 

Infectious diseases are our oldest, deadliest foe.

And they remain so today. ""In a good year, flu kills over 10,000 Americans,"" says Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""In a bad year, it kills over five times that. If we have a pandemic, it will be much worse. People think the H1N1 flu wasn‚Äôt so bad. But more than 1,000 American kids died from H1N1!""

19,K3odScka55A,Vox,Why you can't compare Covid-19 vaccines,2021-03-20T12:00:13Z,28,"What a vaccine's ""efficacy rate"" actually means.

Sign up for our newsletter: http://www.vox.com/video-newsletter

In the US, the first two available Covid-19 vaccines were the ones from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. Both vaccines have very high ""efficacy rates,"" of around 95%. But the third vaccine introduced in the US, from Johnson & Johnson, has a considerably lower efficacy rate: just 66%.

Look at those numbers next to each other, and it's natural to conclude that one of them is considerably worse. Why settle for 66% when you can have 95%? But that isn't the right way to understand a vaccine's efficacy rate, or even to understand what a vaccine does. And public health experts say that if you really want to know which vaccine is the best one, efficacy isn't actually the most important number at all.

On February 24th, Russia launched a military invasion of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin called it a ‚Äúspecial military operation,‚Äù but the scale of the attack shows this is a full-scale war that has already caused more than 100 casualties and forced more than half a million Ukrainians to flee their homes.

Ukraine and Russia‚Äôs conflict goes back to 2014, when Russia invaded and annexed Crimea and Russian-backed separatist forces took over parts of southeastern Ukraine‚Äôs Donbas region. But to understand the full context behind the invasion, it‚Äôs important to go even farther back, to the time when Europe‚Äôs current-day divisions began, and see how that shaped Europe‚Äôs power balance today.

21,HdsWYOZ8iqM,Vox,The lost neighborhood under New York's Central Park,2020-01-20T13:00:05Z,27,"Before Central Park was built, a historic black community was destroyed. 

Help our reporting on hidden histories. Submit a story idea here: http://bit.ly/2RhjxMy

If you‚Äôve been to New York, you‚Äôve probably visited Central Park. But there‚Äôs a part of its story you won't see. 

It‚Äôs a story that goes back to the 1820s, when that part of New York was largely open countryside. Soon it became home to about 1,600 people. Among them was a predominantly black community that bought up affordable plots to build homes, churches and a school. It became known as Seneca Village. And when Irish and German immigrants moved in, it became a rare example at the time of an integrated neighborhood.

Everything changed on July 21, 1853. New York took control of the land to create what would become the first major landscaped park in the US -- they called it ‚ÄúThe Central Park.‚Äù 

In the Vox series Missing Chapter, Vox Senior Producer Ranjani Chakraborty revisits underreported and often overlooked moments from the past to give context to the present. Join her as she covers the histories that are often left out of our textbooks. Our first season tackles stories of racial injustice, political conflicts, even the hidden history of US medical experimentation.

Elegant Olympic dives fly by in a matter of seconds. Because of that, it‚Äôs hard to know what to look for when you try to judge the sport from your couch. One thing that‚Äôs easy to see, though? The splash.

If you‚Äôve watched any Olympics diving coverage, you may have noticed that the splashes athletes make are tiny. Divers spend years training to perform with minimal splash, in the same way that gymnasts train to stick their landings.

In this video, Team USA‚Äôs head diving coach Drew Johansen explains the three major components he uses to guide his athletes towards smaller splashes: the above water position, the underwater swim, and the underwater pike. 

And while the sport of diving isn‚Äôt all about getting splashes, a small splash is the perfect punctuation to a job well done.

27,NVH7JewfgJg,Vox,Why South Africa is still so segregated,2021-04-12T12:00:19Z,25,"How centuries of division built one of the most unequal countries on earth.

Subscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (üîî) http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

For decades, South Africa was under apartheid: a series of laws that divided people by race. Then, in the 1990s, those laws were dismantled. But many of the barriers they created continue to divide South Africans by skin color - which in turn determines their quality of life, access to jobs, and wealth. Racial division was built into the fabric of cities throughout South Africa, and it still hasn't been uprooted.

That's partly because, while apartheid was the culmination of South Africa's racial divisions, it wasn't the beginning of them. That story starts closer to the 1800s, when the British built a network of railroads that transformed the region's economy into one that excluded most Black people -- and then made that exclusion the law.

Vox Borders Episodes:
1. Haiti and the Dominican Republic ( https://youtu.be/4WvKeYuwifc)
2. The Arctic & Russia (https://youtu.be/Wx_2SVm9Jgo)
3. Japan & North Korea (https://youtu.be/qBfyIQbxXPs)
4. Mexico & Guatemala (https://youtu.be/1xbt0ACMbiA)
5. Nepal & The Himalaya (https://youtu.be/ECch2g1_6PQ)
6. Spain & Morocco (https://youtu.be/LY_Yiu2U2Ts)

The sixth and last Vox Borders episode deals with a border between Morocco and Spain. The journey to asylum is never easy. And perhaps no one knows this better than would-be African migrants to the European Union. In North Africa, on the border of Morocco, there's a Spanish town called Melilla. It's technically Europe.

So undocumented migrants and refugees, asylum seekers, wait in limbo for a chance to scale the fence and apply for asylum in Europe. It's the first of many, many hurdles. And it's a tall one.

Today‚Äôs Republican Party opposes big government. It‚Äôs culturally conservative. Its demographic support is strongest among white voters, and it usually dominates elections in the South. And its 2016 presidential nominee has been heavily criticized for inciting racial tensions.

But things weren‚Äôt always this way. 

Over the past 160 or so years, the party has undergone a remarkable transformation from the party of Abraham Lincoln‚Ä¶ to the party of Donald Trump.

Throughout his career as a drug trafficker, tunnels have been the common theme in El Chapo‚Äôs story. When he gained control of a major drug trafficking corridor in the late 1980s, Joaquin Guzman Loera ‚Äî then known as ‚Äúel Rapido‚Äù‚Äî was the first to create super tunnels for transporting drugs across the border.

At the time, a crackdown by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) meant Colombian cocaine was in decline and the Mexican narcotrafficker saw an opportunity. By using tunnels to facilitate fast transport, El Chapo leveraged his role as a trafficker to claim new responsibilities as a cultivator and distributor of drugs. 

Over the next twenty years, he learned how to use his drug tunnels in ways nobody had ever imagined and his success became dependent on his subterranean inclinations. Although his masterful use of tunnels led him to a maximum security jail cell at Altiplano prison, it would be tunnels that also led him back out again.

Mohammad bin Salman was designated as Saudi Arabia's new crown prince in June 2017. Since then, he has rapidly consolidated power and led Saudi Arabia towards some progressive reforms, such as granting women the right to drive. He also has plans to privatize certain segments of the economy, with the goal of reducing Saudi Arabia's economic dependency on oil. These changes, along with a suppression of Saudi Arabia's religious Right, could potentially begin to destabilize one of the Middle East's most powerful nations.

Correction at 7:48: The protester says ‚ÄúThey are not doing this for themselves, but for the future of Hong Kong.‚Äù

Hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers have taken to the streets to protest a controversial extradition bill that could send Hong Kong residents to mainland China to be tried in court. Hong Kong‚Äôs Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, says the bill is meant to prevent Hong Kong from becoming a safe haven for fugitives. But its opponents fear that Hong Kong would be exposed to China‚Äôs flawed judicial system, which would lead to further erasure of the city‚Äôs judicial independence.

At first Lam was determined to move forward with the bill. But after a series of massive protests, she announced she would ‚Äúindefinitely suspend‚Äù the bill. But protesters aren't accepting the suspension, and have started demanding its complete withdrawal. They've also begun calling for Lam‚Äôs resignation.

But this rise in tensions is about a lot more than a bill. To understand why this bill hits a nerve with Hongkongers, it's important to understand Hong Kong‚Äôs relationship with China - and exactly how the bill would tip the scales in China‚Äôs favor.

After prohibition ‚Äî the total ban on alcohol ‚Äî many states established a minimum legal drinking age of 21. But that began to change after the voting age was lowered to 18. Many states followed by lowering their drinking ages, which changed the landscape for the entire country.

By the 1980s, this unusual patchwork of drinking ages started to be seen as a problem, especially by activist organizations like MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Drivers) and RID (Remove Intoxicated Drivers). They lobbied for a 21-year-old minimum legal drinking age, and President Ronald Reagan supported the cause. His mechanism for enabling a national law? Threatening to withhold Federal Highway funding to states that didn‚Äôt comply.

It was an unpredictable strategy for an official typically hesitant to use federal power over the states, and the practice was eventually challenged in the Supreme Court, where it was upheld.

Beyond the political clash, it‚Äôs a look at how roads shape policy.

In the few short years since the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria formed, it has done the seemingly impossible, seizing vast areas of the Middle East to form a mini-state it calls a reincarnation of the ancient Caliphate. It is at war with all its neighbors and virtually the entire world, yet someone remains, and is launching increasingly deadly terror attacks abroad.

To understand how this terrible group came about and how it has grown so powerful, you need to understand the story behind its rise. And that is a story that goes back decades, to long before ISIS existed.

These days, pro golfers are hitting the ball far. Really far. And it's creating a problem: because modern golfers can reach the hole with fewer shots than before, older courses -- like Augusta National Golf Club, Oakmont Country Club, and others -- are becoming obsolete. Now, professional organizations, like the United States Golf Association, are struggling to find a solution for big powerful golfers like Dustin Johnson, Bubba Watson, and Tiger Woods. While the jump in distance is due to lots of factors, conversation is centering on the controversial possibility of redesigning the golf ball to reduce distance. It'd be the latest turn in the ball's long history: Golf balls have evolved from ""featheries,"" to gutties, to balata balls, and eventually dimpled modern balls. But the biggest, and most recent change? The almost-instantaneous switch from wound balls to solid core multilayer balls like the Titleist Pro V1.

Venezuela was once the richest country in Latin America. It has the largest known oil reserves in the world and its democratic government was once praised world wide.

But today, Venezuela‚Äôs democratic institutions and its economy are in shambles.The country has the highest inflation in the world, making food and medicine inaccessible to most Venezuelans. 

Over the last four years, its GDP has fallen 35%, which is a sharper drop than the one seen during the Great Depression in the US. The country‚Äôs murder rate has surpassed that of the most dangerous cities in the world.

These conditions have sparked months of protests against the president, Nicolas Maduro. And it‚Äôs easy to see why: the country has become measurably worse since his election in 2013.

Japan‚Äôs Shinkansen doesn‚Äôt look like your typical train. With its long and pointed nose, it can reach top speeds up to 150‚Äì200 miles per hour. 

It didn‚Äôt always look like this. Earlier models were rounder and louder, often suffering from the phenomenon of ""tunnel boom,"" where deafening compressed air would rush out of a tunnel after a train rushed in. But a moment of inspiration from engineer and birdwatcher Eiji Nakatsu led the system to be redesigned based on the aerodynamics of three species of birds. 

Nakatsu‚Äôs case is a fascinating example of biomimicry, the design movement pioneered by biologist and writer Janine Benyus. She's a co-founder of the Biomimicry Institute, a non-profit encouraging creators to discover how big challenges in design, engineering, and sustainability have often already been solved through 3.8 billion years of evolution on earth. We just have to go out and find them. 

This is one of a series of videos we're launching in partnership with 99% Invisible, an awesome podcast about design. 99% Invisible is a member of http://Radiotopia.fm

In the ‚Äô80s, scientists discovered there was a hole in the ozone over the South Pole. A significant layer of gas that deflects much of the sun‚Äôs radiation was disappearing much faster than anyone expected. Projections suggested it would collapse by 2050, increasing skin cancer rates, harming crops, and destroying the marine food chain. The situation was dire. But today, we are on the path to recovery.

Dr. Susan Solomon, among other scientists, contributed key findings to understand what was depleting the ozone layer and how to address it. In this video she takes us back to her expedition to Antarctica, breaks down how we managed to fix this huge problem, and looks at our next big environmental challenge ‚Äî climate change ‚Äî with the unbridled optimism that drove her to fix the ozone hole.

Haiti and the Dominican Republic share a border, and an island. But the two countries are very different today: the Dominican Republic enjoys higher quality of life for many factors than Haiti. I went to this island and visited both countries, to try and understand when and how their paths diverged. And I began to learn how those differences are playing out in the present.

Vox Borders is a new international documentary series presented by lululemon, by Emmy-nominated videojournalist Johnny Harris. For this series, Johnny is producing six 10-15 minute documentaries about different borders stories from around the world.

Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has similar symptoms to the flu. They also spread in similar ways. So it's natural to want to compare the two. But Covid-19 is very different, in ways that make it much more dangerous. And understanding how is key to understanding why we have to take it so seriously.

The video conferencing session between the two schools was conducted between students of Gyan Mandir Public School (Delhi, India) and Adamjee Model School (Karachi, Pakistan). The session was coordinated by Ms Anju Anand and Ms Devika Mittal from Indian side and Mr Usama Palla and Ms Suraya Islam from Pakistan. We're grateful they let us drop by!

The British tasked Cyril Radcliffe with the job of drawing a line to separate Punjab and Bengal provinces from India into East and West Pakistan. Muslims and Hindus weren‚Äôt the only ones being separated from each other. Sikhs and people from other faiths were affected as well. 

A Sikh pilgrimage was divided because of the new border, Punjabi people of all faiths were separated from each other, and a culture was ultimately divided.

This Vox Borders episode looks at how the Radcliffe line changed Punjab and how communities are affected now.

48,LVWTQcZbLgY,Vox,The sound illusion that makes Dunkirk so intense,2017-07-26T12:00:23Z,25,"Why Christopher Nolan is obsessed with Shepard tones.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk is a nerve-wracking movie. Three separate storylines tell the tale of the famed World War II evacuation in a intense two hours of film. A lot of that feeling has to do with how the film's score uses Shepard tones¬†‚Äî¬†layered sound waves that simulate a constant ascent in tone ‚Äî¬†to create a sensation of building tension. They're a personal favorite trick of Nolan's: he's based sound effects and entire soundtracks with other composers on the auditory illusion. In Dunkirk, composer Hans Zimmer crafted his soundtrack around the effect ‚Äî¬†and it's an auditory masterpiece.
