Karmel Allison, who has type 1 diabetes and is 20 weeks pregnant, began to swoon as she stood behind the president during his 25-minute speech in the White House Rose Garden. 

He interrupted his remarks to help her: ""You're ok. I'm right here. I got you."" As one of his aides helped lead Mrs Allison away, he added: ""This happens when I talk too long.""

She later took to Twitter to thank the commander-in-chief for the catch, saying: ""I'm ok world- just got a little lightheaded.Thanks, @BarackObama for catching me! And good thing this pregnant diabetic is pregnant :)""

“This is a spot where the Russians tried to break through on a ringroad yesterday, they were ambushed by the Ukrainians,” said Roland Oliphant, The Telegraph's senior foreign correspondent.

“The situation is this: as far as we understand the Russians have stopped on the northern side of the city. They don’t seem to be doing much for now but they’re lobbing shells in towards the Ukrainians and into the northern suburbs. 

“Our suspicion is they’re going to try and decapitate Kyiv so they don’t have to fight here.”

With Mr Trump, 74, telling Mr Biden, 77, ""there is nothing smart about you, Joe”, and Mr Biden branding the president ""a bulldozer”, the debate produced several heated moments.

“Nobody is going to break us, we’re strong, we’re Ukrainians.”

President Zelensky also challenged EU leaders to “prove” they are Europeans by backing his bid for Ukraine to join the bloc.

“Prove you are with us, do prove that you will not let us go, do prove that you, indeed, are Europeans and then life will win over death and light will win over darkness,” he said.

Explorers making the first manned voyage to the Titanic wreckage in more than a decade said they had uncovered a partial collapse of the ship's hull and that the Captain’s quarters had also deteriorated heavily.

Nearly 13,125ft (4,000m) beneath the surface of the Atlantic Ocean, in water at a bitterly cold one degree, salt corrosion and metal-eating bacteria have worn away parts of the liner's structure.

The team of divers found that the hull near the officers' quarters on the starboard side of the ship has started to collapse, taking with it the vessel's luxurious stateroom accommodation, according to exploration company Caladan Oceanic.

He told CBS reporter Jiang to ""ask China"" in response to her question at a White House press conference.

Why does that matter? Why is this a global competition to you if every day Americans are still losing their lives and we are still seeing more cases every day?” she asked.

“Well, they are losing their lives everywhere in the world,” Trump said. “Maybe that is a question you should ask China. Don’t ask me. Ask China that question. When you ask China that question you may get a very unusual answer.”

A number of his political adversaries, including Republic Senator Ted Cruz, seized on Mr Biden’s latest gaffe, using it to question his cognitive state.

Footage of the moment, shared by millions on social media, showed the gaffe-prone President turn to his right, before he appeared to say something into empty space while miming a handshake.

A Swiss League match between FC Thun and Zurich was disrupted after a pine marten escaped onto the pitch on Sunday and evaded capture for over five minutes. 

The marten, which is similar to a weasel, appeared at one point to have be caught Zurich defender Loris Benito. 

But Benito was bitten for his troubles and it managed to escape again. 
Martens are known for their sharp teeth which are usually used to eat birds, berries and the occasional garden hose. 

So it was up to Zurich goalkeeper Davide Da Costa, armed with his gloves, to pick up the marten. 

The crowd applauded as Da Costa escorted the pitch invader off the field. 
Zurich went on to win 4-0.

28,tcOY8ziJdLk,The Telegraph,What sound does an ancient Egyptian mummy make? Scientist recreate voice of 3000 year old mummy,2020-01-23T16:00:10Z,25,"When Egyptian priest Nesyamun died more than 3,000 years ago his departing wish was that he be allowed to speak in the afterlife so he could address his gods, and be granted entry into eternity.

Now, with the help of science, the holy man has indeed found his voice after death.

Academics at Royal Holloway, University of London, University of York and Leeds Museum scanned the mummy of Nesyamum, 3D printed his vocal tract then played soundwaves through it to create an impression of how the priest might have sounded.

So far, the only noise they’ve created is a nondescript bleat, sounding something like ‘beh’ but the researchers are hoping to use computer modelling to recreate words and even sentences. 

The experts said it allowed people to ‘make direct contact with ancient Egypt by listening to a sound from a vocal tract that has not been heard for over 3000 years.’

And they want to eventually try the technique on other famous ‘heads’, and bring back the voices of notable figures.

35,Fzu9ZNEuU9Y,The Telegraph,Russia's fighting power is exhausted in Ukraine - here's why | Defence in Depth,2023-05-11T18:00:11Z,25,"Moscow’s Victory Day parade held on May 9 was notable for the lack of military hardware on display.

It’s supposed to remember and respect the Second World War generation, but Putin and Soviet leaders before him have used it as a means of expressing power and prestige.

So it was surprising that the only tank on the parade was an 80-year-old T-34 from the Second World War.

Should we laugh at such a poor display of Russian military might? How powerful is Russia's armed forces and how can we objectively assess the state of Putin’s army?

En route, he met up with Nugs, an ex-British military security advisor training Ukrainian troops in advanced tactical warfare.

The military expert compares undertrained mobilised Russian soldiers 'being sent to the meatgrinder' to Soviet battle tactics of World War II.

""They’re pushing Russian troops to the front line and they’ve got a group of others behind them to stop them from retreating. It’s sick,"" Nugs says.

He adds that he's deeply skeptical Russia will resort to nuclear weapons despite their threatening sabre rattling.

""They can say it all they want in terms of the promotion of fear. It won’t happen,"" he said, adding: ""They would be destroyed even before they got anywhere near their target.""

Jack and his team head to the Sumy region 4 km from the Russian front line to give out aid to civilians, many of who are too elderly to evacuate the heavily shelled area.

""Any movement in this direction will be considered by us as participation in an armed conflict by that country,"" he said.

Ukrainians have been asking NATO to impose a no-fly zone but NATO leaders, wary of a potential clash with the Russian air force, have steered away from it.
