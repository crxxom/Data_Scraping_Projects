0,oh2Sj_QpZOA,Sky News Australia,SPECIAL INVESTIGATION: What Really Happened in Wuhan,2021-09-27T23:00:11Z,25,"Get Sharri Markson’s book ‘What Really Happened in Wuhan’ here: https://linktr.ee/WhatReallyHappenedInWuhan

This Sky News Australia special investigation into the origins of COVID-19 reveals what really happened in Wuhan in the early days of the pandemic.

Award-winning journalist Sharri Markson spent more than a year investigating the potential leak of the virus from a top-secret laboratory in Wuhan.

Ms Markson uncovered evidence of a widespread cover-up and unpacks the new theory that “patient zero” worked in the Wuhan lab.

Sky News Australia anchor and Investigations Writer at The Australian, Sharri has been at the forefront of investigating the origins of COVID-19 since early in 2020 when the virus spread globally. Since that time, the precise genesis of COVID-19 has been hotly contested, with scientists, government officials, the World Health Organization, and the Chinese authorities releasing conflicting reports.

In a coup for Australian television, Sharri secures the first sit-down interview for an Australian broadcast media outlet with Donald Trump since he was elected president in 2016. 

Sharri also speaks with a range of Chinese whistle-blowers, scientists, and high-ranking intelligence officials to bring us closer to discovering the truth of what happened in Wuhan. 

These include John Ratcliffe, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence from 2020 to 2021, and former head of British intelligence service, Mi6, Sir Richard Dearlove.",13316674,233564,,43049,PT59M46S

“After her cringeworthy performance in recent weeks, she had the opportunity to redeem herself during a vitally important trip to Poland and Romania as Russia's invasion of Ukraine plunges the region into a deepening crisis. The White House said her visit will demonstrate the strength and unity of the NATO Alliance,” Ms Panahi said.

“What it actually did was demonstrate the utter ineptitude of the vice president.

“You might be wondering what prompted that mad cackling during such a serious press conference, was there perhaps a moment of lightness during such a dark time. Well, no, that embarrassing performance was prompted by a serious question about the unfolding refugee crisis. ”

Ms Harris' laughter occurred after she was asked if the US would make a specific allocation for Ukrainian refugees. 

""It's little wonder that Ukrainian President Zelensky's former press secretary said this of Kamala after that chuckle happy performance with the Polish president,” Ms Panahi said.

""'It would be a tragedy if this woman won the presidency'.""  

“Never mind winning it, the fear is she'll be installed president during Biden's first term should the 79-year-old's health decline further. 

“But put the mad chucking to one side – Kamala Harris' incompetence and complete lack of foreign policy acumen was on display every time she actually answered a question. 

“Kamala Harris is proof of what can happen when you disregard meritocracy and embrace identity politics – Kamala is what happens when you choose people for key roles not according to their ability, experience or acumen but according to their gender or their skin colour.”",2734295,71453,,23133,PT4M58S

Senator Thorpe took to the Senate chamber last week to target the NT attorney general, and said she hoped “he listens to these experts” on indigenous incarceration given “he didn’t read the royal commission”.

Northern Territory Attorney General Selena Uibo responded in force to Senator Thorpe’s comments, and said she had “pointers” for her and any “other southern politician” who wanted to use the NT as a “punching bag for their own political point scoring”.

“One, get your facts straight,” she said.

“The Northern Territory attorney general is not a white man, I am an aboriginal woman”.

Ms Panahi said Selena Uibo gave Senator Thorpe a “nice working over” where she “called her out” for some of her appearances in rural and remote communities.",1442851,29469,,3412,PT3M14S

The CNN anchor was a guest at the University of Chicago’s panel discussion on ‘Disinformation and the Erosion of Democracy’ when a college student didn’t hold back arguing the network had made several mistakes including failing to report on the Hunter Biden laptop story. 

 “You’ve all spoken extensively about Fox News being a purveyor of disinformation but CNN is right up there with them,” college freshman Christopher Phillips said.

“With mainstream corporate journalists becoming a little more than apologists and cheerleaders for the regime, is it time to finally declare that the cannon of journalistic ethics is dead or no longer operative?

“All the mistakes of the mainstream media – CNN in particular – seem to magically all go in one direction. Are we expected to believe that this is all just some sort of random coincidence or is there something else behind it?”

Brian Stelter replied joking it was “time for lunch” before defending his network.

“I think my honest answer to you – and I will come over and we will talk in more detail after this – is that I think you’re describing a different channel than the one that I watch.”",1418989,52809,,14202,PT5M41S

“As one computer said, if you’re on the train and they say Portal Bridge, you know you better make other plans,” he said.
