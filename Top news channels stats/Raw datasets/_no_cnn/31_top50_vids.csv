The partially naked woman was then sent for a stroll down London's Kensington High Street to see how passers-by would react to her unusual outfit. Kelly's attire - or lack of - attracted far more attention than the spray-on jeans she sported for a similar test last month.

Experts believe it suffered a catastophic implosion.*

Missing Titanic submarine: Five things that may have gone wrong. It is another mystery of the deep.
 
As hopes fade for the five wealthy Titanic tourists who vanished while exploring the wreck aboard a mini submarine – one question keeps being asked.
 
What happened?
 
It is possible that no one will ever know after the sub, called Titan, suddenly went silent hundreds of miles off the coast of Canada and around 13,000ft underwater beside the Titanic.
 
On board were five men including a British billionaire, one of Pakistan’s richest men and his son, a famed French explorer, and the CEO of the company running the dive.
 
But submarine experts agree that five possible accidents are the most likely cause.

Sebastian was walking with his mother Ingrid in Australia when he had to explain he was her son. 
The mother and son were strolling along a footpath when Sebastian asked his mum if she knew who he was.

'You're a lovely carer,' said Ingrid while holding onto his arm.

'What if I told you I was your son?' asked Sebastian.

The mum was confused, thinking her boy was a minder with the same name. She didn't believe him at first, and said that he merely looked like her son Sebastian.

Her eyes lit up when she realized the truth and she sang a rendition of Vera Lynn's We'll Meet Again, edited to praise her boy and express her love for him. 

'Ingrid wants to meet Sebastian some sunny day, some sunny day, because Ingrid love Sebastian very much,' she sang.

At one point, one woman blurted out, 'You'll always be our Captain Jack Sparrow!' The actor momentarily assumed the voice of the Pirates of the Caribbean protagonist. 'He's still around somewhere. I see him now and again,' he said in Sparrow's iconic slurred British accent, according to a video posted on Twitter by user Bekka Schultz Fontanilla . 'He shows up now and again.'

24,-u0UeY4epuQ,Daily Mail,These Titanic submarine 'flaws' may be behind disaster,2023-06-23T11:55:02Z,25,"On 22 June the wreckage of the Titan submarine was found on the sea bed 500 yards from the Titanic. Experts say the submarine suffered a catastrophic implosion and the five passengers onboard died. It was steered by Playstation controller, used components bought from Camping World and didn’t have safety certification. But five missing Titanic tourists paid to descend 12,500ft in the Titan submarine. Now they have vanished without a trace, and questions are being asked why experts who raised safety concerns about the OceanGate vessel were apparently ignored. One of the engineers was so concerned he quit the project, one man was said to have refused to ride the sub after seeing how it was built, and one man who did described his voyage to a newspaper as ‘suicide’. These are all the potential concerns that could have led to disaster.

As Putin's brutal attack on the Ukraine continues to unfold, the 44-year-old actor-turned-president has spent the duration of the war in the trenches with his military, advocating on behalf of his country. Through tweets, video press conferences and conversations with global leaders,  Zelensky has worked tirelessly to inform the world  of the atrocities being committed on behalf of  Putin. In doing so, he has become an almost folkloric pillar of bravery and strength – but as the days stretch into weeks, and weeks into months, the weight of the conflict has taken a visceral toll on the leader, who has gone from clean-cut, suit-wearing politician to a grizzled military man.

Mala Tokmachka has been the focus of Ukraine’s counter-attack in the south.cIt was here that a failed attack led to the destruction of dozens of Western vehicles.

It came as Turkey reported that one of its ships had been hit by a 'bomb' off the coast of Odessa, where fighting is also going on. Turkey is a member of NATO, underlining fears that the war in Ukraine could quickly suck in other states and spark an all-out conflict in Europe. Elsewhere, Kiev ordered civilians into bomb shelters and declared a curfew amid fears Russia is about to strike the Ukrainian capital as Kiev's troops lost control of a key airfield around 15 miles away. The Ukrainian army was this afternoon fighting in almost every region of the country, battling the Russians for control of military bases, airports, cities and ports from Kharkiv to Kiev, and Donetsk to Odessa after Vladimir Putin declared all-out war.
