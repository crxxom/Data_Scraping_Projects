The House Jan. 6 committee announced an previously unplanned hearing for June 28, promising new evidence and witness testimony.

Committee members did not confirm a focus for Tuesday's hearing, scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. ET. But it will likely lean heavily on the testimony of Cassidy Hutchinson, a senior aide to former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, the NewsHour and other media outlets confirmed.

In the course of her work for the White House, Hutchinson had firsthand insight into communications between Meadows and former President Donald Trump, including those leading up to the insurrection and in the days afterward.

In the year since its creation, the committee has conducted more than 1,000 interviews, seeking critical information and documents from people witness to, or involved in, the violence that day.

Additional hearings are expected in July.

33,7u4ocGJ9ZXI,PBS NewsHour,WATCH LIVE: Jan. 6 Committee hearings - Day 3,2022-06-16T20:49:44Z,25,"Warning: This hearing may include footage of violence.

The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack will hold its third public hearing June 16, focused on former President Donald Trump's efforts to pressure former Vice President Mike Pence to reject Congress' official count of Electoral College votes on the day of the attack. 

The hearing is scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. ET on Thursday, June 16.

The  vice president is charged with overseeing the Electoral College vote count -- already certified by individual states -- in a joint session of Congress following a presidential election. Trump called on Pence repeatedly to reject the results confirming President Joe Biden's win, telling supporters in a rally hours before the attack that ""it will be a sad day for the country"" if his vice president did not come through. Pence said in a statement after the speech he did not have the constitutional authority to do what the president asked. Some rioters began chanting ""hang Mike Pence.""  Committee member Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said at the start of the hearings that upon hearing this,  Trump said ""maybe our supporters have the right idea.""

The committee postponed a hearing scheduled for June 15 that was meant to focus on Trump's efforts to replace Attorney General Bill Barr, who did not support his claims of voter fraud after the election. Members of the committee said this week they thought they had evidence to indict Trump for seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which they will lay out as part of several public hearings this month.

The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack will hold its fourth public hearing June 21, focused on former President Donald Trump's efforts to pressure state legislators and local election officials to change the results of the 2020 presidential election.

The hearing is scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. ET on Tuesday, June 21.

The hearing comes after the committee on Thursday, June 16 laid out evidence on how Trump pressured his then- vice president, Mike Pence, to overturn the election, even as the Capitol insurrection was underway. The June 16 hearing played out testimony from several aides and close Trump allies that all testified to the pressure that the president was putting on Pence. The vice president is charged with overseeing the Electoral College vote count -- already certified by individual states -- in a joint session of Congress following a presidential election-- that is what was taking place on Jan. 6, 2021. Pence said on that day that he did not have the constitutional authority to do what the president had asked.

Members of the committee said last week they thought they had evidence to indict Trump for seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which they will lay out as part of several public hearings this month.

39,r5YOqIK7Bkk,PBS NewsHour,WATCH: Democratic counsel’s questioning of committee lawyers | Trump's first impeachment,2019-12-09T19:13:13Z,25,"Barry Berke, the House Democratic counsel, questioned Republican counsel Stephen Castor and fellow Democratic counsel Daniel Goldman on Dec. 9. The questioning came on the second day of public hearings by the House Judiciary Committee as part of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. Berke asked a question that both Castor and Goldman appeared to agree on. “Is it your experience, that when someone has done something wrongful and corrupt, and they’re dealing with somebody who’s not in the scheme, that they state their intentions to do something wrongful and corrupt?” Berke asked. Castor said no, in a general sense. In answering Berke’s question, Goldman said, “You almost never have a defendant ... who would ever explicitly say … 'I’m going to bribe you now. I’m going to ask you for a bribe. I’m going to extort you.' That’s not how things work.” The Judiciary and Intelligence committees have led the probe, hearing testimony from witnesses and legal experts about Trump’s conduct. House lawmakers are currently drafting the articles of impeachment, on which House lawmakers are anticipated to vote in the coming weeks. The impeachment case has revolved around a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked the president of Ukraine to investigate former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

41,DJtRtWu7gcE,PBS NewsHour,WATCH: Former Justice Department official said Trump asked him to call 2020 election ‘corrupt’,2022-06-23T20:58:00Z,25,"Former acting deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue spoke on June 23 as the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack presented its findings in their fifth public hearing.
Donaghue went through the steps the Department of Justice took to investigate claims of fraud that former President Donald Trump had repetitively raised. They said they found none of the claims to be factual.

“We went through a series of other [claims that the president raised]. The truck driver who claim to have moved an entire tractor trailer of ballots from New York to Pennsylvania. That was also incorrect. We did an investigation with the FBI, interviewed witnesses at the front end and the back end of that trailer’s transit from New York to Pennsylvania. We looked at loading manifests. We interviewed witnesses, including, of course, the driver, and we knew it wasn't true. Whether the driver believed or not was never clear to me, but it was just not true,” he said.

Donaghue began taking handwritten notes on a call with the president when he made an allegation that was new to him-- that more than 200,000 votes were certified in Pennsylvania that were not actually cast. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill. showed Donoghue’s notes at the hearing which quoted the president directly from the call the two had.

“The president said, ‘just say the election was corrupt. And leave the rest of me and the Republican congressman,’” Kinzinger said. “That’s a direct quote from President Trump?”
“Correct, “ Donaghue said. “That's an exact quote from President. Yes.”

Kinzinger also played video testimony from former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani where Giuliani was asked about whether obscure DOJ official Jeffrey Clark was recommended to be put in a leadership position of the department after Clark had pushed proposals to further the president's effort to overturn the 2020 election.

“I do recall saying to people that somebody should be put in charge of the Justice Department who isn't frightened of what's going to be done to their reputation. Because the Justice Department was filled with people like that,” Giuliani said in a video testimony.

The hearing, the fifth of several planned by the Jan. 6 committee, focused on Trump’s pressure on the Department of Justice to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. In the year since its creation, the committee has conducted more than 1,000 interviews, seeking critical information and documents from people witness to, or involved in, the violence that day.

47,fuP1Bqsqk9w,PBS NewsHour,WATCH: Rep. Liz Cheney says Trump ignored pleas to stop Jan. 6 violence | Jan. 6 hearings,2022-06-10T01:37:02Z,25,"Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming said in her opening remarks of the first Jan. 6 committee hearing June 9 that former President Donald Trump's intention as the violence unfolded ""was to remain president of the United States, despite the lawful outcome of the 2020 election.""

The hearing June 9 was the first of several planned by the Jan. 6 committee in the coming weeks. In the year since its creation, the committee has conducted more than 1,000 interviews, seeking critical information and documents from people witness to, or involved in, the violence that day.

Cheney added that the committee learned that Trump ""oversaw and coordinated"" a seven-part plan to overturn the presidential election despite advisors being aware Trump had lost. Despite that, Cheney said, the president embarked on a campaign to spread the lie that the election had been stolen.

""Over a series of hearings in the coming weeks, you will hear testimony, live on video, from more than half a dozen former white house staff in the trump administration. All of whom were in the west wing of the white house on January 6th. You will hear testimony that 'The president did not really want to put anything out, calling off the riot or asking his supporters to leave.' You will hear President Trump was yelling and 'really angry' at advisers who told him he needed to be doing something more. And aware of the rioters chants to 'hang Mike Pence,' the president responded with this sentiment: 'Maybe our supporters have the right idea, Mike Pence deserves it.'""
