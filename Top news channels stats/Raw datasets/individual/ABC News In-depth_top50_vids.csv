0,M2IQuXbExjU,ABC News In-depth,Inside Mexico's Most Powerful Drug Cartel | Foreign Correspondent,2021-07-22T10:00:11Z,25,"Tens of thousands are missing, many more murdered. So why are Mexico’s violent drug cartels operating with impunity? We go inside the most powerful cartel to meet the footsoldiers. Corruption, they say, goes right to the top. Produced in collaboration with Ben Zand and Vice TV.

In Mexico’s Sinaloa state, violence has become a way of life.
Home to the country’s most powerful drug syndicate, the Sinaloa cartel, murders and disappearances are rife.

The police, meant to protect the population, are often the targets of violence. Over 500 officers were killed in Mexico last year.

They’re also often complicit, with corruption in the police force and government a major problem.In this shocking portrait of a country caught in the grip of organised crime, reporter Ben Zand takes us where few have gone – inside the Sinaloa cartel in the Sierra Madre mountains where he witnesses the group’s operations up close.

At their hidden base, the group grows poppies and marijuana for export, fends off outsiders with guns and bribes visiting police and security officers with money and women.

“The government is the one in charge” say the local leader. “The cartel is only as big as the government wants us to be.”

Commentator and writer Ioan Grillo believes that the police and military used to have the upper hand with the cartels but says that’s now changed.

“Some of the cartels have become much more powerful,” says Grillo. “[now] the cartel is actually bullying and controlling elements of the security forces.”

It’s the community who’s paying the price for corruption and impunity. 
Mirna Quiñones’ son disappeared suddenly 7 years ago. When police refused to help her, she set out to find him herself. 

She went on to set up the Trackers of El Fuerte group which helps parents looking for their children. In the last seven years of searching, they’ve uncovered over two hundred bodies.

“There is no justice. We all know that. I have been threatened by the municipal police here. The government and crime are united.”

Interior Minister, Olga Sánchez Cordero, concedes there is corruption. “The trials, and the investigations, are deficient”, she says. “Lawyers are threatened. Judges are threatened. That is just the reality.”

But she maintains the government is doing its best to investigate the cartels and to undermine their support base. 

Investigative journalist Anabel Hernández disagrees, saying she has little faith the government of Andrés Manuel López Obrador, elected two and half years ago, will tackle the problem.

“He promised to do something different but….it’s just the same. Nothing changed. In some parts it's worse.""

As the explosion occurred, people around Beirut captured the moment, and its aftermath, on their phones.

Four Corners pieces together the story of the blast, tracking down many of the people who filmed the disaster, as well as those who were dramatically shown on screen.

In a city with so many connections to Australia, the pain and grief are immense.

Wuhan — a city more populous than London or New York — placed in ‘lockdown’ following the outbreak of the new and deadly coronavirus.

In China, more than two thousand people have died, with tens of thousands more infected, and authorities are resorting to extreme measures to try to halt the contagion. In interviews filmed on smartphones, Chinese activists and Australians trapped in the lockdown explain what they are going through.

Four Corners charts how the outbreak occurred and investigates whether a cover-up by Chinese authorities allowed the virus to spread.

5,cBYryDFLO4Y,ABC News In-depth,Is Thailand the New Weed Capital of the World? | Foreign Correspondent,2022-10-06T09:00:31Z,25,"From zero tolerance to decriminalisation, Thailand’s recent u-turn on its cannabis laws is lighting up a billion-dollar industry. Officially it’s for medicinal use but the legal grey area means ‘ganja’ lovers are celebrating. Subscribe: https://ab.co/3yqPOZ5 

It’s the country which gave us the words ‘bong’ and ‘ganja’.

In Thailand, cannabis has been used for centuries in traditional medicine.

But when the US launched its ‘war on drugs’ in the 1970s, Thailand became a key partner, placing cannabis on the narcotics list and toughening penalties against it.

This June, the country took it off that list, meaning cannabis sellers and recreational users no longer risked jail for selling or possessing cannabis.

In tourist hotspots, a ‘ganja-culture’ is fast taking hold. In Bangkok’s Khao San Road nightspot, it seems easier to buy a joint than a Pad Thai.

‘Now it’s legal – God gave a gift for us’, says Choco Gonzales, a cannabis seller in Bangkok. 

And it’s party time for tourists at the famous full moon party at Koh Phangan in the country’s southeast.

‘Wherever you go now, it’s Amsterdam again in Asia’, says an Italian tourist at the party. 

As Australia reignites on its own debate about legalising cannabis, Southeast Asia correspondent Mazoe Ford travels around Thailand to meet the new crop of ‘ganja-preneurs’ cashing in on the green rush.

In Bangkok, Kitty Chopaka, a shop owner selling cannabis products and a leading advocate of decriminalisation, is still pinching herself. 

‘I never thought in my lifetime that this would actually happen…But at the same time I knew it has to be done.’

In the southern island of Samui, resort owner Carl Lamb reckons the liberalisation of the laws is attracting overseas tourists. 

‘You can really feel it's reinvigorated the market. There's a new energy here.’

Ford also hitches a ride on the private jet of the politician behind the policy – Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul.

He takes us to Thailand’s east to spruik the medicinal cannabis industry which the government hopes will become a billion-dollar industry.

‘It turned out that majority of my voters chose to vote for my party… some people even called my party (the) “Cannabis Party”’, he tells Ford.

But not everyone welcomes the change.  More than a thousand doctors have warned that the drug was delisted before proper safeguards and regulations were in place.

‘We don't want to be the cannabis haven of the world’, say Doctor Chanchai Sittipunt from Chulalongkorn University's Faculty of Medicine.
 
But Kitty Chopaka says going back isn’t possible - the genie is out of the bottle.

‘That bottle is broken. It’s gone!’

A secretive Kingdom, faraway. American Jared Morrison has dreamed of meeting his dad since he was a kid.
Subscribe: https://ab.co/3yqPOZ5
Like many young Saudi men, Jared’s father came to America to study in the 1970s. At university, he met Jared’s mum and they began a relationship. When she became pregnant, he disappeared back home.

Throughout his childhood and into adulthood, Jared was obsessed with finding his Saudi father.

“I had that overwhelming urge and drive...to find him, locate him, learn about him, learn about the culture. It was just an innate instinct.”

Jared connected once on the phone when he was in his early twenties but his father rejected him. Now that Saudi Arabia has begun to open up to the world, Jared wants to try again.
 
Reporter Brietta Hague and Saudi producer Essam Al-Ghalib tell the exclusive story of Jared as he travels to the Kingdom to try and track down his father. It’s a dangerous, fraught and emotionally risky mission. 

Jared's family is powerful and well-connected in Saudi and Jared bumps up against the unwritten rules of a deeply conservative society, which values reputation and family honour above all.

Jared is not alone in his quest to connect with his Saudi father. 

Saudi men abroad continue to father and abandon children. In Guatemala, we meet a young boy and his single mother, his Saudi father long since departed. Sami Alrajhi Chang visits the mosque every week to learn Arabic in the hope he may one day meet his Saudi family.

Sami’s father Sulaiman came to study in the USA as part of a Saudi government scholarship programme. There he met student Mandre Chang. Despite promising her marriage and a life together, he abandoned Mandre days after Sami’s birth. 

Mandre and Sami are part of a global network of people searching for answers. Stone-walled by the Saudi government and embassies, Mandre sought the help of a blog called ‘Saudi Children Left Behind’, a platform encouraging the children and ex-partners of Saudi men to publish their stories of abandonment in the hope they’ll make contact. 

'Saudi Children Left Behind' is an untold story about the powerful human impulse to connect with family, against all odds, and a rare insight into the rigid rules governing this hidden Kingdom – rules about kinship, obligation and family honour.

Dying is an expensive business but as this investigation reveals, what you pay for is not necessarily an indication of the service received.

14,bB3kuuBPVys,ABC News In-depth,The Environmental Disaster that is Fuelled by Used Clothes and Fast Fashion | Foreign Correspondent,2021-08-12T10:00:13Z,25,"The dark side of the world’s fashion addiction. Many of our old clothes, donated
to charities, end up in rotting textile mountains in West Africa. This is a story
about how our waste is creating an environmental disaster.

Have you ever thought about what happens to your old clothes after you drop them off at the
op shop? It might be time to start, because these goodwill gestures are helping to fuel an environmental catastrophe on the other side of the world.

When charities in Australia can’t sell donated clothing, tonnes of it ends up being exported to
countries like Ghana, in West Africa. Ship after ship docks every week with bales from Europe,
the US, China and Australia.

They call them ‘Dead White Man’s Clothes’. Once they arrive in Ghana, they’re taken to the
bustling Kantamanto markets in the capital Accra and from here, they make their way to
villages and towns across the country.

The industry provides jobs for thousands of people, like Asare Asamoah, a successful importer.
He brings in clothes, mainly from the United Kingdom, and if they’re good quality, he can make
a decent living.

But it’s risky business. He has to pay upfront for a bale and never knows whether it’s trash or
treasure. With cheap, fast fashion flooding the world, the quality of the clothes arriving in
Ghana is getting worse and worse.

‘Sometimes you’ve gone and bought something, then you don’t get what you want’, says
Asamoah. ‘Then you lose your money.”

And there’s a dark side to this industry.

Correspondent Linton Besser travels to Ghana to uncover the dirty secret behind the world’s
fashion addiction.

While 60 per cent of imported fashion items are reused and resold, 40 per cent are rubbish,
creating an environmental catastrophe for this poor nation.

With the main dumpsite for textile waste now full, unregulated dumpsites ring the city. These
fetid clothes mountains are often set on fire, filling the skies with acrid smoke.

‘It is totally a disservice to us in this part of the world because we have become sort of the
dumping ground for the textile waste that is produced from Europe, from the Americas”, says
Accra’s waste manager, Solomon Noi.

Emmanuel Ajaab imports used clothes from Australia but he despairs at the poor quality of the
clothes that arrive. From a bale of about 200 garments, he finds only seven he can resell at a
good price.

“In Europe and UK and Australia, America, they think Africa here, sorry to say, we are not like a
human being”, he tells Foreign Correspondent.

The dumped textiles also get swept up in the monsoonal rains and end up choking the city’s
waterways and beaches, posing a danger to fishermen and aquatic life. Liz Ricketts, who runs
an NGO campaigning for awareness of Ghana's textile waste crisis, lays the blame at the feet
of international fashion houses.

“Waste is a part of the business model of fashion. A lot of brands overproduce by up to 40 per
cent”, says Ricketts.

Noi begs the people who donate their clothes to think twice about where they end up.

“If they come here, like you've come, and you see the practicality for yourself, then they will
know that, no, we better take care of these things within our country and not to ship that
problem to cause problems to other people.”

The mafia is one of Italy’s most famous international business brands, with an estimated annual turnover of $250 billion a year. But its market share is being challenged by a group of ruthless new players.

Foreign Correspondent’s Emma Alberici investigates the growing power of Nigerian organised crime in the birthplace of the Italian mafia.

The director of Italy’s anti-mafia agency says Nigerian crime gangs are organised and dangerous:
“It has many similar traits to Italian mafia – its oaths, its sense of belonging, the capacity to coerce, the code of silence…even the local mafia fear them.”

Specialists in trafficking humans for sexual slavery and drug running, the Nigerians are now being allowed to run their operations in return for giving the Italian mafia a cut. 

A former prostitute, trafficked from Nigeria, tells us:
‘There’s no pity. If you misbehave…or you can’t continue anymore, they will bring their gun and shoot you.’ 

We investigate the two main hubs for Nigerian organised crime in Italy. 
North of Naples, Alberici visits Castel Volturno, an almost lawless coastal town, abandoned by the local Camorra Mafia and by the state. Here, the Nigerian Mafia is left alone to use this once “Mafioso Riviera” as a hub for its European operations.

In Sicily, the mafia’s birthplace, we go undercover to expose prostitution and drug houses and catch up with the man named by investigators as one of the Nigerian Mafia’s kingpins.

At a secret location, we speak to Roberto Saviano, one of the world’s most famous Mafia whistle-blowers. He lost his freedom 13 years ago after revealing the sordid workings of the Camorra mafia in Naples. 

Now living under permanent police guard, Saviano explains the role Nigerian organised crime plays in Italy’s homegrown mafia. 

To stay silent, he says, is to be complicit.

17,SORthIsoLP0,ABC News In-depth,Living Lonely and Loveless in Japan | Foreign Correspondent,2022-02-17T09:00:12Z,25,"Around the world more and more people are opting for the single life but in Japan, loneliness has become an epidemic.   Subscribe: https://ab.co/3yqPOZ5
Marriage and childbirth rates are falling, as more and more young Japanese choose to stay single and childless. Relationships are too difficult, they say.

In the country’s last Fertility Survey, figures showed that a quarter of women in their 30s were single, and half of those weren’t interested in having a relationship. 

Many Japanese adults aren’t even having sex. It’s estimated around 10% of people in their 30s are still virgins.
 
By 2040, it’s estimated nearly half of Japan’s population will be single.
Correspondent Jake Sturmer has reported from the ABC’s Tokyo bureau for 4 years and nothing has confounded him more than this social crisis.
As he prepares to return to Australia, Jake sets out on a final journey to discover the forces driving this ‘Solo Society’.

He meets 29-year-old Sayaka, who works in the fashion industry. Sayaka is happily single, and not interested in getting married. 

“I’m under a lot of (social) pressure but I don’t mind,” she says. “There's nothing I can’t do without a man at the moment.”

Instead, the objects of her affection are her dogs - Kogemaru, Unimaru, Rinmaru and Riko - whom she loves to spoil.

Naoya, a 32-year-old creative director for an advertising company, isn’t in a rush to get married either. He often feels lonely but hanging out with friends cheers him up.

“It’s fun drinking with my friends like this and I’m able to fill in the loneliness,” Naoya tells Jake in a cosy bar in downtown Tokyo.

Jake also explores a darker side of Japanese society, meeting a man who has opted out in an extreme way, hiding in his bedroom and avoiding society altogether. He’s what’s called a hikikomori, someone who withdrawn socially. 

In Japan there are more than a million hikikomori. Jake meets the mother of one who’s become an activist, campaigning for Japanese society to be more tolerant of those who don’t fit the mould.

“People believe they need to change the people who’ve withdrawn but I think it’s exactly the opposite. I think the society should change,” she says.

Jake spends time with Masatomi, a cleaner whose job is to clear out the homes of those who die alone. Each year, tens of thousands of Japanese end their lives alone, their bodies often found after neighbours detect an odour. Masatomi is calling for Japanese people to sit up and take notice.

“It’s something that could happen to anybody including myself. I strongly feel that we need to have connections with other people. I feel outrage, why don’t they see what’s going on?""

19,lF3mnuxjPCw,ABC News In-depth,The Year Bali Tourism Stopped | Foreign Correspondent,2021-03-09T09:00:14Z,25,"Bali’s natural beauty and rich culture have made it a tourist magnet but since COVID19, the island is struggling to stay afloat. Locals are questioning their dependence on tourism and the over-development it has unleashed.

Marcello and the lifeguards of Kuta Beach rise bright and early for their morning meeting and surf sprints. But they know it’s going to be a quiet day. While the iconic beach normally attracts 50 000 visitors a day from around the world, today the head lifeguard expects only 50 people.

“Nobody makes a life on the beach"", says Marcello. “People who sell massage, or merchandise on the beach…I heard they all go back home to their village. It’s a very sad situation.""

It’s a common story across the island, even in its remotest corners.

Off Bali’s east coast on the small island of Ceningan, Wayan lost his job at a hotel, and had to return to farming seaweed with his family. It’s the same story across Ceningan.

“Before we had 100 per cent tourism. Now 80 or 90 percent they are doing seaweed farms”, says Wayan who’s had to cop a 75% pay cut. “We had no choice but to return to nature.""

But some Balinese see the crisis as an opportunity.

“This is a wake-up call for all of us”, says Christia, a young businesswoman. “We realized that we cannot just depend on one industry.”

In this visually stunning story, reporter and cameraman Matt Davis travels around Bali and discovers an island in the midst of some serious soul searching.

He meets locals who are questioning the unhinged development that’s accompanied the tourist boom and who want to chart a different course for the future.

“Bali tourism industry is based on two things, nature and culture"", says rock star Robi Gede, “and we cannot sacrifice them”.

Politicians and businesspeople want to fix the congestion, pollution and rubbish problems and encourage a different type of tourism. One that’s sustainable and benefits locals more.

“I think it's a good time for reflection this year”, says Christia, “Go back to loving our island and make sure that people don't abuse our island as well.”

“We hope that when the tourists come back, they are coming with a good energy, they are not littering, with more respect for the local rules”, says Marcello. “Come with a good vibe.”

The luxury holiday promised great entertainment and the opportunity to get up close to the country’s renowned natural beauty.
 
But things quickly turned nightmarish when a group of day-trippers and cruise ship passengers were trapped in the middle of a volcanic eruption. 

47 people were inside the White Island volcano crater when it erupted.

21 were killed.

19 of them were from the Ovation of the Seas.

Four Corners investigates what tourists understood about the dangers of visiting New Zealand’s most active volcano and whether more could have been done to prevent the tragedy.

21,1Xij_cIe5_A,ABC News In-depth,Gwarosa: Working to Death in South Korea | Foreign Correspondent,2021-08-26T10:00:13Z,25,"Since the start of the pandemic, 21 delivery workers in South Korea have died. Unions blame overwork. The Koreans even have a word for death by overwork: 'gwarosa'. 

We all rely on home deliveries to get us through the pandemic but do we ever spare a thought for the workers who bring them to us?

As demand for home deliveries explodes, the pressure on warehouse sorters and drivers has become relentless. 

Lee Seong Wook, 44, is a delivery driver. He works six days a week from early in the morning until late at night.

“I'd be lying if I said it isn't tough for me. But it’s a matter of survival. My children won't eat if I don't earn.”

Lee’s colleague, 47-year-old driver Im Gwang Soo, recently suffered a massive brain haemorrhage and fell into a coma. His life is hanging in the balance. Before his collapse, Im Gwang Soo had been working over 90 hours a week.

As companies compete with each other to offer faster delivery times, distribution workers and drivers have borne the brunt, putting in longer and longer hours. 

The ABC’s South Korea correspondent Carrington Clarke goes on the road with the drivers and hears stories of their struggles as they race against the clock to deliver more packages than ever before.

He rides with 61-year-old driver Huh Wonjea, the son of an activist and fighter in the Korean Independence Movement. Mr Huh says South Koreans worked hard to rebuild their country after the war, but not everyone is reaping the rewards.

“The whole country’s been developing, but still in terms of the fair distribution of the assets or human rights… not really fairly developed yet.”

Lee Seong Wook is a branch leader of the Delivery Workers’ Union. He’s determined that his generation will be the one to force change.

“If our generation can't change it, it’ll be passed down to the next generation and then what we sacrifice for our children would be meaningless. “

It’s not just the drivers who are suffering. Those working in the distribution centres are also being pushed to their limits and beyond.

27-year-old Jang Deokjoon died of a heart attack. He’d been working long hours in the “fulfillment centre” of e-commerce company Coupang, described as the “Amazon” of South Korea. The government ruled it was “death by overwork”.

“These really clever people used their brains only to work out how to squeeze as much blood from the workers as possible within the boundaries of the law”, says Deokjoon’s mother.

In response to union pressure, some companies have introduced restrictions on delivering parcels after 9pm. But many drivers still have parcels left. If they don’t deliver them, their workload the following day will be even greater, so they keep working. For any food items they deliver after the 9pm cutoff, they’ll pay late fees. They’re damned if they do, damned if they don’t.

Dead on Arrival is a timely and cautionary tale of what happens when workers are pushed to the limit in the name of consumer convenience and company profits.

“If consumers don’t start thinking about it there will be other victims. Do you really think it’s okay to turn a blind eye or force someone to be sacrificed for your convenience?”, asks Deokjoon’s mother.

For the first time ever, the program has been granted access to Bon’s family and friends who provide fresh insights into his vulnerabilities and state of mind leading up to his untimely death in London in 1980.

The program features the first interview with Bon’s younger brother Derek and is introduced by Brian Johnson, Bon’s successor with the band.

Bruce Howe, a former bandmate who shared a house with Bon for five years, noticed a big change when he last saw him in late 1979.

“He wasn’t bubbly and laughing.  Maybe he’d come to the state where he’d achieved his dream, he found his holy grail, but found that his holy grail might have looked like an empty goblet,” he told the program.

To this day, Bon Scott is considered one of the world’s best rock and roll singers.

23,O8KQbZDatg0,ABC News In-depth,Japan's Great Wall: Can It Stop A Tsunami? | Foreign Correspondent,2021-03-02T09:00:17Z,25,"When a massive tsunami engulfed the north-eastern coastline of Japan a decade ago, it wiped out everything in its path, flattening villages, killing nearly 20,000 people and triggering a nuclear meltdown.

The old seawalls which had been built along the coastline to protect villages and infrastructure offered little protection. Today, the government’s solution to a future tsunami is to build an even bigger and longer seawall to protect Japan’s coastal communities.

Up to 14 metres high and 400 kilometres long, the new seawall is dividing
communities, and some fear, placing them in greater danger.

In this ARTE documentary, presented by former ABC Japan correspondent Mark Willacy, The Great Wall of Japan travels along the north-eastern coast of Japan’s main island to meet the fishermen and communities affected by one of the country’s biggest ever construction projects.

Oyster farmer Atsushi Fujita has mixed feelings about the wall, saying it’s destroying his community’s livelihood and culture.

“We're all very sad that our former lifestyle has gone and we can no longer see the ocean from our windows. It's really affecting us a lot.”

In the village of Akahama, fisherman Hiromi Kawaguchi has galvanised locals against the building of a giant wall. While he lost his wife and mother to the 2011 tsunami, he has no faith a new seawall will protect locals in the event of another great wave.

“In the last tsunami, the old wall was destroyed and its remains were left floating on the surface like cubes of tofu. Everything man-made is destined to be destroyed. It’s inevitable.”

But others support the wall, including construction executive Kazunori Yamamoto, who believes the old seawall saved his family in 2011.

“The breakwater earned us precious time, enabling a lot of people to escape. Without the breakwater, my whole family would have died.”

Scientists are divided on the benefits. Some say the wall will slow a tsunami’s advance, allowing more time for people to escape. Others say it will do the opposite, providing a false sense of security, delaying departure and putting people in greater danger.

Some believe the 13 billion US dollars spent on the wall’s construction could have been better used moving more communities to higher ground.

As Japan commemorates the tsunami’s 10th anniversary, this is a moving and timely story from the region hardest hit by the 2011 disaster.

24,Oqh6hGLqAG8,ABC News In-depth,"Salt, Sewage and Sinkholes: The Death of the Dead Sea | Foreign Correspondent",2021-06-10T10:00:14Z,25,"It’s the lowest place on earth. A sea in the middle of a desert. Fed by the waters of the Jordan River, nestled on the borders of Israel, Jordan and the West Bank, the Dead Sea has supported life and provided spiritual healing for millennia. 

But today the Dead Sea is disappearing, its waterline receding year by year. And the fight over this diminishing resource is fueling tensions between Palestinians and Israelis.

In a visually stunning story, correspondent Eric Tlozek travels through this ancient land to unravel the mysteries of this vanishing sea.

Upstream in the Jordan Valley, the waters which feed into the Dead Sea have been diverted for agriculture and now there’s not enough to go around.

Zeyad, whose family lives in the Jordan Valley, says Palestinian farmers aren’t getting their fair share of water.

“They have a very big shortage of water. The water allocated for this village actually is less than 50% of the needed water.”

David, an Israeli farmer, says the Jewish settlers have used the water well, making an arid land productive and fertile.

‘When we came to the Jordan Valley, we found a desert’, says David, a spokesperson for settlers in the West Bank. ‘Nothing was growing here. So now the Jordan Valley is green.’

Downstream, as a result of less water, the landscape around the Dead Sea is being dramatically transformed and is collapsing in on itself. It’s creating a strange phenomenon - ‘sinkholes’.

Highways which once teemed with traffic are now buckled and broken. Holiday resorts which once hosted families are abandoned and ruined.

“It’s a spectacular landscape that developed in a few years”, says an Israeli government geologist.

Meanwhile, the faithful still believe in the waters’ healing powers even though much of the water they bless now comes from sewage pipes.

“Once the water of the river is blessed…anyone that has any kind of pain or any kind of bad feelings he can wash himself with this water and he can be healed”, says an Armenian Orthodox priest.

There’s debate about schemes which could halt the sea’s decline but there’s little political will. 

“Who will pay the price for this water?”, asks one geologist.

This is an epic journey through a land with a rich history, a troubled present and an uncertain future.

“If our children will say that they wanted to save it, they can't even do it because it's too late. Everything that's happening here, it's because of us,” says Carmit, an Israeli hydrologist.

25,Q4JhhhrjGgw,ABC News In-depth,The City where Thousands of Russians have fled since the Invasion of Ukraine | Foreign Correspondent,2022-04-28T10:00:12Z,25,"Since President Putin invaded Ukraine in February, some 200,000 Russians have fled their country, scattering across western and eastern Europe.

Around 30,000 have landed in Georgia, a former Soviet country on Russia’s southern border, where it’s cheap to live and visas are easy to get. 

Nika Nikulshina can’t see herself going home any time soon.

“I really think that I will not be able to go to Russia till Putin will, I don't know, die, disappear, become a bug or something. So yes, I think we need to wait for his death.”

The Russian refugees are distressed at the invasion of Ukraine and the brutal crackdown on free speech.

Ekaterina and her husband Tikhon were high-profile presenters at the independent station in Moscow, TV Rain. When it shut down shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, they fled.

“There is no guarantee that they will arrest you, but there's no guarantee that they won't. So there are much more chances that you're going to be in jail, if you go back and we're not ready to have this kind of risks. We have kids,” says Tikhon.

“It was the most stressful and terrible moment of my life. We have decided everything that we are leaving and to you know pack up stuff and wake up kids in the middle of the night … A couple of hours and your whole life has changed”, says Ekaterina.

In a timely story, we film both inside Russia and in neighbouring Georgia, meeting the brave people opposing Putin and his war.

In St Petersburg, we meet 76-year-old artist Yelena who’s been arrested for protesting against the war but is refusing to stay silent. 

“There are good Russians too. But now there is so much shame for our country, so much disgrace. Russia always had much to be proud of. But this is all so awful.”

Dissidents inside Russia are increasingly isolated as State TV whips up hostility against anyone who questions the government.

But those who’ve landed in Georgia feel vulnerable too because the Georgian government has been reluctant to criticise Putin for fear of reprisals. Many Russians living in Georgia are unsure how long they’ll be welcome there.

“We know that Georgian government is not happy with us being here because they are afraid that …Georgia will become a safe space for Russian independent journalists,” says Tikhon.

“It is not a safe space.”

Opinion polls are giving Democrat contender Joe Biden a decisive lead, and despite Donald Trump's insistence, even some of his most prominent supporters concede he has a battle on his hands.

29,9A1LtmxkAYk,ABC News In-depth,How Denmark took a hard line on Immigrants | Foreign Correspondent,2019-10-08T07:00:01Z,25,"‘What is Danish?’ asks comedian Ellie Jokar. Born in Iran, now a Dane, Ellie struggles to understand why her once friendly country has pulled up the welcome mat. Hamish Macdonald explores a nation with an identity crisis.

It’s one of the most open and equal countries in the world. Denmark has long had a reputation for welcoming migrants and protecting its minorities. But these days there are fractures in this once cohesive society. Its mood of tolerance has shifted and now migrants feel on the outer. 

‘When do you feel Danish? What is Danish?’, asks actress and comedian Ellie Jokar, who arrived in Denmark from Iran with her family when she was four. Now she feels she lives in a no man’s land.

""I define myself as a grey zone kid because people like me are not accepted by the Danes and not accepted by the Muslims.”  

In recent years, the government has passed a hundred laws which place strict controls on immigrants: they’ve frozen the intake of refugees, banned the burqa in public and made it mandatory for children of migrants to attend Danish cultural training from the age of one. 

The laws are some of the most draconian in Europe and have the backing of both sides of politics. Some areas with large immigrant populations have been designated as ‘ghettos’, where you get double the punishment for a crime.   

Foreign Correspondent reporter Hamish Macdonald travels through Denmark in midsummer and takes the temperature of a country in the middle of an identity crisis.

He meets a far-right politician whose provocative stunts include throwing around the Koran and who often needs a police entourage when he appears in public. He wants all Muslims deported.

Hamish visits a young Muslim woman who’s been driven indoors by the burqa ban, and he has lunch with the local councillor who’s making pork compulsory on the menu at restaurants and schools in his area.

“If you want to be integrated and accepted, they must also accept the way we live”, he says.

Hamish also takes a ride in Ellie’s pink taxi – made famous in her hit YouTube show – where she interviews Danes from all sides of the political fence, using humour to navigate and explore the cultural divide.

“I meet people that are different than me…and I try to get to the bottom of, how did they become extreme Muslims? Extremist right wing?”, she says. But Ellie is increasingly worried about the growing divisions in her country and longs for strong leaders who can build bridges.

‘So the Danes are over here. The Muslims are over here and…they don't really know how to communicate’.

As leader of the Communist colossus, he commands the world’s attention, but who is China’s strongman and what is his agenda?

Born into the privileged life of a princeling, banished to poverty in the countryside during a political purge, his early life formed and framed his views on power and control.

His rise up the political ladder was propelled by party connections and an advantageous celebrity marriage. As he rose through the party ranks, he carefully crafted his image. 

Today it’s a full-blown cult of personality featuring compulsory lessons in “Xi Jinping Thought”.

China specialists say that the country has already fundamentally re-written the international rule book. The question is, how will the rest of the world respond?

China has warned it will take Taiwan by force if necessary, while US military strategists are now mapping out war games to predict the impacts of a conflict.  

They forecast it could become a brutal regional war, with casualties and carnage on a scale not seen since WWII.   

It’s increasingly becoming a question of when – not if – China will launch an assault. Experts say it could be as early as 2025.  

And Australia would play a key role in the conflict as it spills across the Pacific.  

The investigation reveals how the US has been quietly building up its military assets in northern Australia, including plans to deploy nuclear capable B-52 bombers south of Darwin.  

There are now fears that relationship could pull Australia deeper into any future conflict.

33,xZSa4B37sZs,ABC News In-depth,Breaking the Calabrian Mafia in Italy | Foreign Correspondent,2022-04-21T10:00:12Z,25,"For years, a ruthless mafia has ruled Calabria through intimidation and violence. Now prosectuors are taking them on, charging hundreds in one of the biggest trials in decades. But can the Italian state beat the country's most powerful mafia organisation?

The Calabrian mafia began local but over recent decades it's transformed into a powerful, multi-national criminal organisation, with an estimated turnover of 80 billion dollars a year. 

Now Italian prosecutors are running a maxi-trial against members of a family they allege is one of the ‘Ndrangehta’s most powerful clans – the Mancusos.

More than 300 members and associates of the Mancusos have been arrested.

The charge sheet is sobering. It includes murder, extortion, drug trafficking and money laundering.

In this gripping crime saga, Fran Kelly travels to Vibo Valentia to tell the story of this historic attempt to curb the power of the ‘Ndrangheta.

She gains access to the man leading the trial, Chief Prosecutor Nicola Gratteri. He’s  been investigating the Calabrian mafia for decades and has long been on the mafia’s kill list. 

“There’s always tension. There’s always fear and you must always be careful”, he tells Kelly as he drives to court surrounded by his security motorcade. “You have to tame fear and talk to death.” 

Kelly speaks with community members who now feel emboldened to speak out against the mafia.

‘The number of people turning on the mafia has increased’, says anti-mafia activist Giuseppe Borrello. ‘It’s new for Vibo Valentia.”

Gratteri’s actions have given hope to Sara Scarpulla, whose son was blown up in a car bomb organised by a member of the Mancuso family.

Kelly also speaks to an anti-mafia prosecutor in Milan, Italy’s financial heart, where the ‘Ndrangheta has established a strong presence. 

In Calabria, not everyone in the community is rallying behind Nicola Gratteri’s maxi-trial. 

“There’s vicious mudslinging aimed at the Prosecutor’s Office’, explains lawyer Giovanna Fronte. “That’s how the ‘Ndrangheta operates.”

For the people of Vibo Valentia, the maxi-trial has raised hopes of a new chapter in which the State regains control of a land long thought lost to organised crime.  
 
But can these prosecutions uproot the powerful networks of the ‘Ndrangheta?

On the night of the US presidential election, Donald Trump declared the vote was a ""major fraud on the American people."" Rather than face defeat, he and his allies began a campaign claiming the election had been stolen.
 
In the aftermath, high profile Fox News presenters gave a platform to Trump's campaign pouring fuel on the already ferocious political divide.
 
Now, their words and actions are under scrutiny in multi-billion dollar lawsuits. Election software companies Dominion and Smartmatic sued Fox News for its coverage of false claims the 2020 presidential election was rigged.
 
In an exclusive interview, Trump’s former lawyer and advocate of the 'stolen election' conspiracy, Sidney Powell, is asked to justify her claims.

They were flying on what was then the world's newest, most sophisticated civilian aircraft, powered by prestigious Rolls Royce engines.

In 2011, Four Corners told the compelling story of the frightening hours that followed.

40,Faro2mDRklg,ABC News In-depth,Coronavirus: Inside Italy's COVID-19 Lockdown | Foreign Correspondent,2020-03-24T09:30:13Z,25,"It’s Europe’s coronavirus epicentre with cases of infected rising by up to a thousand daily. Hospitals are full. Patients, young and old, are dying. To control the outbreak, Italy is in lockdown but is it too little too late?

In the province of Lodi, half an hour from northern Italy’s capital Milan, it’s day 23 of the lockdown.

A young couple - Isabella and Roberto - are stuck inside with their 3-year-old daughter Eleonora. They’re wondering when they will be able to resume normal life.

The northern Lombardy region has been dubbed the ground zero of Italy’s corona crisis. So far, over two thousand people have died there and nearly thirty thousand have been infected.

After Lombardy, the virus spread through the north, then nationwide.  
At first, doctors mistook it for the flu. Precious time was lost and now Italy, known for its warm embraces and kisses on both cheeks, has more cases than any country apart from China. 

Hospitals have been swamped. All non-corona related patients’ care has been sidelined. Doctors have been issued with protocols about which patients to prioritise and which not to – a form of disaster medicine.

Desperate to bring the virus under control, Italy has finally taken strong action, declaring a nationwide lockdown. Schools and universities have shut. Shops, cafes and restaurants have closed. Apart from buying groceries, people need official authorisation to move around or else face a fine.

Reporter Emma Alberici can’t travel to Italy but she has relatives and friends there. 

For this special report, Emma taps into her network of family and friends as well as doctors and businesspeople, to tell an intimate story about how families, communities and the country are dealing with this unprecedented health emergency.

We use skype calls, phone diaries, photos and home video to bring you a picture of Italy in lockdown.

In Milan, we meet the head surgeon at one of the city’s major hospitals. He’s isolated at home after contracting the Coronavirus from one of his patients. He explains how he’s being treated for the infection and his fears for his wife, who’s working as an obstetrician.

There’s 7-year-old Zoe, who doing school from her home in Milan. She skypes her Australian friend Livia and they chat and giggle about the virus and hand washing.

We meet Emma’s 90-year-old aunt recently hospitalised with influenza, and her cousin – also Emma Alberici – who’s looking after her mother while holding down a job as CFO of a big pharmaceutical company in Milan – an industry which has special exemption from the lockdown. 

We hear from Isabella and Roberto about the meals they’re cooking and the bread they’re baking.

And we interview virologist Prof Roberto Burioni who warns Australia that this virus is dangerous and must be taken with the utmost seriousness.

This is an intimate insight into an extraordinary moment in history.

With the help of social media platforms.” 
Maria Ressa, journalist and Noble laureate.

Ferdinand Marcos Jnr, the son of his dictator father Ferdinand Snr, is poised to become the next President of the Philippines.

Once synonymous with corruption and authoritarianism, the Marcos family is restoring its once tarnished reputation.

So how did this miraculous makeover happen?

Reporter Bonny Symons-Brown visits the Philippines on the eve of momentous national elections to find out how Bongbong Marcos became so popular his rivals barely stand a chance.

She finds a nation deeply divided over its recent political history.

Ferdinand Marcos ruled the country for two decades with an iron fist, imposing martial law, even jailing and torturing his political opponents.

The President and his glamourous, powerful wife Imelda Marcos flaunted their lavish lifestyle as they stole billions from the nation’s coffers.

In 1986, they were forced out of the country by a ‘People Power’ revolution but today many Filippinos have forgotten why and forgiven the family.

“I think people get tired of the mudslinging against the Marcoses, and people now realise that the best president and the best administration we had was President Marcos”, says Larry Gadon, a senatorial candidate on Marcos Jr’s ticket.

He dismisses the stories of torture and human rights abuses under martial law as ‘propaganda’.

But Cristina lived it. A member of the underground residuring the martial law years, she was picked up by soldiers, interrogated and tortured.

“We have to continue to tell the story so that it doesn’t happen again”, she says. Journalist and Nobel Laureate Maria Ressa says part of the problem is the massive spread of disinformation online.

“What social media has done is to spread lies faster than facts,” she tells Symons-Brown. “And this will help pave the way for a win.”

This is a timely and unsettling story about how the powerful weapon of social media can be deployed to rewrite history.

43,rJnOlaZwMeg,ABC News In-depth,Inside Israel's Closed Off Ultra-Orthodox Communities | Foreign Correspondent,2022-04-14T10:00:22Z,25,"In the modern State of Israel, the ultra-Orthodox – or Haredi – communities live a world apart.

Rejecting the secular, they live according to ancient religious principles.
Many Haredi men spend their days in religious schools studying the Jewish bible.

“People here focus on the essentials: on the Torah. Material things are irrelevant here,” says Yossef, a member of a Haredi community on the edge of Tel Aviv.
 
“On Shabbat, cars stand still, everyone observes Shabbat. The women show restraint outdoors.”

Yossef’s wife, Esther, supports her husband.

“Man was created to study day and night. As a woman, I support that and benefit from it as well.”

The Israeli government subsidises this lifestyle, exempting community members from compulsory military service.

It’s lead to resentment among secular Jews, tensions which have deepened during COVID.

“This is a state within a state,” says one Israeli MP. “Many Haredi movements want to integrate into Israeli society…the only problem is that some Haredi leaders strongly hinder this integration.”

Presented by Eric Campbell, this Arte documentary explores how pressures from outside are forcing many Haredim to integrate more with the modern world.

Moshe is one who’s pushing the boundaries. He’s set up a tech company which adheres to religious rules, including providing separate workspaces for men and women.

“In the business world, the sexes share a space and many Haredim don't deal well with that. So, we founded this place, so the Haredim feel comfortable in the high-tech world.”

Chira dreams of becoming a professional singer, but as a Haredi woman she’s not allowed to perform for men. She’s decided she wants to be a performer, but only for other women.

“I will never be able to sing on a stage where everyone can see me. But a new female audience is emerging. They organise parties, celebrations for young girls, festivals for women.”

Moshe feels his community’s traditions can help drive innovation.

“Some think if you preserve tradition, you stay stuck in the past, but the future is innovation… The talent for innovation comes precisely from reflection…This legacy enables us to look forward and invent new things.”

This is a fascinating and rare insight into a normally-closed world on the cusp of change.

44,qInkR8P7q3M,ABC News In-depth,Inside SpaceX's Mission to Send Humans into Deep Space | Foreign Correspondent,2021-09-30T10:00:11Z,25,"In the era of New Space, billionaire Elon Musk is blazing the trail. He’s building a gigantic starship to fly humans further than ever before. 

In the tiny Texan hamlet of Boca Chica, a huge rocket is being built and tested. It’s Elon Musk’s Starship, a 120-metre-high spacecraft whose mission is to transport humans to the moon and beyond, to Mars.

Musk and his company SpaceX are at the forefront of what’s being called ‘New Space’, the rush to commercialise the space sector.

His ambition is extraordinary; he wants to colonise the Red Planet. 

“It’s helpful to have the objective of a self-sustaining city on Mars. This has to be the objective”, says Musk.

In his quest to perfect the Starship, Musk has been blowing up prototypes. 

“He doesn't really care if it's messy, he doesn’t really care if it appears to be chaotic, he's trying to go forward into the future as fast as possible”, says space writer Eric Berger. 

But the mighty rocket has its critics, including a former head of NASA, Charlie Bolden.

“The difficulty for me as a huge fan of SpaceX, but a huge sceptic about Starship is the fact that it's so big, it's so massive”, says Bolden. “If Neil Armstrong were alive today to talk to them, he would probably say, ""That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.” 

US correspondent Sarah Ferguson heads to Texas to see Musk’s space base up close. She joins a band of devotees in Boca Chica, from Gene the local surfer to MaryLiz and Ryan who are dedicating their lives to documenting the billionaire’s space odyssey.

She speaks to members of the ‘space establishment’ – former and current NASA executives who’ve decided to accept and work with the great disruptor. NASA recently awarded Musk a multi-billion-dollar contract to build its next moon lander.

“I think actually this will be a perfect example of ‘New Space’ and ‘Old Space’ meeting together in a great new mission”, says Kathy Lueders, head of the NASA mission to send humans back to the moon. 

Sarah travels to Florida’s space coast to witness the launch of SpaceX’s Inspiration4, the first time civilians have flown into orbit.

Musk is a polarising figure, but he’s changed forever how humans view space.

In the face of new security laws passed in Australia that could see them prevented from returning anytime soon, the women insist they are not a threat. They are begging the Australian government to let them come home.

46,5a0iZvG4kEM,ABC News In-depth,Inside the cartels controlling Australia's cocaine trade | Four Corners,2023-05-22T10:30:03Z,25,"Four Corners has gained unprecedented access to the inner workings of Australia’s cocaine industry. 

We’ve spoken to people across the supply chain, from low-level street dealers to traffickers at the highest levels. 

Some are breaking the underworld’s code of silence to reveal details about the trade that have never been seen or heard before.  

These people are fuelling a cocaine boom across the country. Australians are the highest per capita users of cocaine in the world, and pay some of the highest prices in the world for it – about $350 a gram. 

Police claim things are under control, but those in this shadow economy tell a very different story.",1726396,15034,,,PT44M38S

48,pAFdLaW02jw,ABC News In-depth,The Fight To Take Back Hawaii | Foreign Correspondent,2022-05-12T06:12:38Z,25,"For over a century, the destiny of this island paradise has been in the hands of outsiders. Now native Hawaiians are reclaiming their culture, language and land.
Subscribe: https://ab.co/3yqPOZ5
“Hawaii is being sold to the global elite. It's not give and take. It’s just take, take, take, take.”  Filmmaker Chris Kahunahana

“They took it away in three generations. We’re going to get it back in one. Whatever it takes.” Waterman Pomai Hoapili.

It’s a slice of paradise for some but behind the postcard façade, native Hawaiians have a different story to tell. 

Theirs is a stuggle for land, language and culture, forcibly taken from them by the United States of America.   

Housing prices in Hawaii were already sky high, but in the midst of the pandemic they exploded as mainland Americans bought up island boltholes. The housing crisis is hitting native Hawaiians hardest, forcing many out of their own homes. The state of Hawaii now has the third highest homeless rate in the USA.

This is one of many problems facing native locals who are fighting to ʻKeep Hawaii Hawaiian’.

Reporter Matt Davis visits the Hawaiian Islands to hear from the people fighting to keep their culture alive. In a visually stunning journey, Davis explores the lives of people on the frontline of this modern-day native Hawaiian rennaisance.

“Resistance is not only how we get our land back,” says school principal Kalehua Krug. “But it is also medicine – that resistance is how we heal.”

At his school on the island of Oahu, the curriculum focuses on redsicovering the modern story of Hawaii after the kingdom was overthrown in 1893. The students study the Hawaiian language, hula dancing and other cultural practices alongside the mainstream curriculum.

Davis takes a tour around the back streets of Waikiki with celebrated filmmaker Chris Kahunahana, the first native Hawaiian to direct a feature film. 

“Hawaii was seen as Hollywood’s back drop. It served as a beautiful location for a Caucasian centred hero,” he tells Davis.

His movie Waikiki shows the darker side of these tropical islands – the reality for many native Hawaiians.

Davis visits the powerhouse community leader Twinkle Borge who has set up a permanent camp to provide shelter for Hawaiians who are sleeping rough. She reveals an extraordinary plan to reclaim land and build a village for her community.

And he goes out on the jet ski with waterman Pomai Hoapili in the middle of the worldʻs most famous surfing competition – the Pipeline Pro.

Between surfing on the North Shore and rescuing people caught in the giant waves, Pomai has enrolled in Hawaiian language classes. He practices speaking with his 10-year-old daughter, who’s also learning.

He says it’s urgent for native Hawaiians to practice their culture.

“Be Hawaiian, speak Hawaiian live Hawaiian…If we stop down the line, people stop talking about us, we disappear...we’ve got to keep practicing.”

In Hawaii to compete in the Pipeline surfing competition, the world’s most famous  surfer Kelly Slater asks the world to pay respect.

“Everyone who comes Hawaiian should, should take care of this place and really respect the culture and the locals,” says Slater. “It's their home and it's your place to visit, but, you know, take care of it and look after it and ever one can enjoy it.”

49,HrnQ9U_cXpo,ABC News In-depth,True Detectives: Police reveal details of the underbelly killings (2015) | Four Corners,2019-10-22T06:35:12Z,25,"This joint Four Corners/Fairfax report from 2015 revealed damning evidence that the investigations of key gangland murders in Victoria were deeply flawed, undermining the criminal justice system in the state.

Terry Hodson and Carl Williams were career criminals. Hodson was shot twice in the head by a killer who'd come to his home with no apparent sign of a break-in. Williams was bludgeoned to death while in jail.

Two murders - six years apart, both linked by key facts. Each was a police informant; both had made serious allegations of police corruption; both were killed with police acutely aware both men were in danger.

Despite the extraordinary circumstances of the deaths, it's still not clear who ordered their killing. To this day, no one has been convicted of the murder of Terrence Hodson and his wife Christine.",1603655,5576,,1065,PT44M30S
