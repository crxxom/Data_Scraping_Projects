Opinion: The American-made weapons that could change everything
by David A. Andelman

It seems that increasingly these days, the United States is letting Ukraine fight, valiantly, but is it with one hand tied behind its back?

The US and its allies have given the Ukrainians artillery systems, some of them quite advanced, but withheld those with the longest range or, as arms experts have suggested, the greatest sophistication.

In an address to Congress on Wednesday, Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska asked US lawmakers to send air defense systems to her country ""in order for rockets not to kill children in their strollers.""
Still, Ukrainian officials have expressed their public gratitude for weapons delivered so far. Ukranian President Voldymyr Zelensky, in his daily video message Monday, observed that his armed forces are now ""able to inflict significant logistical losses on the occupiers.""

Military observers tell me that Zelensky and his senior generals have expressed their delight in the new systems that are appearing, hoping that their words will encourage a greater willingness of the West to release even more advanced systems that could turn the tide of battle by leaps and bounds.

There is an electronic war that cries out to be fought -- drones that need to be jammed or flown to precise targets, long-range artillery with GPS targeting, enemy chatter that needs to be plucked from the skies. Some of these capabilities are increasing as the West gradually introduces new systems to the battlefield and trains Ukrainians to operate them.

The growing list of those corporations, including BlueCross BlueShield, Citigroup (C), Commerce Bank and Marriott (MAR), comes after a pro-Trump mob breached the US Capitol last Wednesday to fight against the ceremonial counting of electoral votes that confirmed President-elect Joe Biden's win.
147 Republicans voted against certification of the electoral votes in a joint session of Congress last Wednesday evening. They included Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, among hundreds other congress members.
""At the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, we continuously evaluate our political contributions to ensure that those we support share our values and goals,"" said Kim Keck, BlueCross BlueShield's president and CEO, in a statement. ""In light of this week's violent, shocking assault on the United States Capitol, and the votes of some members of Congress to subvert the results of November's election by challenging Electoral College results, BCBSA will suspend contributions to those lawmakers who voted to undermine our democracy.""
The health insurance company's BLUEPAC political action committee -- supported only by employee contributions -- donated $246,750 to Republican lawmakers during the 2020 cycle. That included $10,000 to Sen. Tuberville, $1,000 to Sen. Marshall and $500 to Sen. Hawley.
BlueCross BlueShield said it's stopping donations to all 147 Republicans who challenged the Electoral College results.

Nearly 80% of Americans have been exposed to Covid misinfo, and many don't know what to believe, survey says
By Brian Stelter and Virginia Langmaid, CNN Business

New York (CNN Business)The information landscape about Covid-19 is bewildering, with factual and fictional claims competing for attention. And most American adults have heard at least a couple of the fictions, according to new data from the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Kaiser, which is widely respected for its top-notch work on this subject, tested eight false statements about Covid. Nearly 80% of Americans surveyed said they had heard of at least one of the falsehoods and either believed it or are unsure whether it is true.

""Most commonly,"" the report's authors wrote, ""six in ten adults have heard that the government is exaggerating the number of Covid-19 deaths by counting deaths due to other factors as coronavirus deaths and either believe this to be true (38%) or aren't sure if it's true or false (22%).""

One-third of respondents ""believe or are unsure whether deaths due to the Covid-19 vaccine are being intentionally hidden by the government (35%),"" the authors wrote, ""and about three in ten each believe or are unsure whether Covid-19 vaccines have been shown to cause infertility (31%) or whether Ivermectin is a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 (28%).""

The researchers also found that ""between a fifth and a quarter of the public believe or are unsure whether the vaccines can give you COVID-19 (25%), contain a microchip (24%), or can change your DNA (21%).""

Why Russia's Ukraine aggression matters to Americans
by Zachary B. Wolf

Nobody knows for sure exactly what Vladimir Putin is doing with around 100,000 Russian troops parked near the Russia-Ukraine border, but it's making the US and Europe extremely nervous.

President Joe Biden said this week he expected the Russians would ""move in"" and that a slight incursion would be met differently than a full-on invasion.

The US has spent the past few days cleaning up that remark and making clear any type of invasion is unacceptable.

Asked in Geneva by a reporter if he thought, like Biden, that an invasion was likely, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov used some interesting language.

""Unless the United States doesn't go to bed with Ukraine, I don't think so,"" Lavrov said.
What does it mean for countries to 'go to bed'? All of this high-stakes geopolitical chess, then, comes down to how intimate the US gets with Ukraine in the eyes of Russia.

Right-wing lawyer Sidney Powell 'is cooperating' with federal criminal probe into fundraising
By Katelyn Polantz, CNN Reporter, Crime and Justice

A lawyer for Sidney Powell, a well-known, Trump-connected attorney, acknowledged that her organization's fundraising connected to the 2020 election is subject to an ongoing federal criminal investigation.

Powell's lawyer, Howard Kleinhendler, told CNN that his client ""is cooperating"" with the investigation into her organization, Defending the Republic, by the US Attorney's Office in the District of Columbia. That cooperation includes ""rolling productions"" of documents.

The Washington Post first reported details of the probe, including a grand jury subpoena for records related to it, in November.

Powell has not been charged with a crime. The investigation has continued this year, though two sources with knowledge of the probe tell CNN it's unclear when -- if ever -- any charges would be filed.

A spokesman for the DC US Attorney's Office declined to comment on Friday.
Powell's response to the federal investigators and to a major defamation lawsuit from the company Dominion Voting Systems comes into play as she now prepares to respond to the House select committee investigating January 6, which subpoenaed her this week.

(CNN) One of the Russian Navy's most important warships has sunk in the Black Sea, a massive blow to a military struggling against Ukrainian resistance 50 days into Vladimir Putin's invasion of his neighbor.

Russian state news agency TASS reported Thursday evening that the guided-missile cruiser Moskva had sunk, citing a statement from the Russian Ministry of Defense.
""During the towing of the cruiser Moskva to the port of destination, the ship lost its stability due to hull damage received during a fire from the detonation of ammunition. In the conditions of stormy seas, the ship sank,"" the statement said, according to TASS.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, during an interview on a conservative podcast this week, compared House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to continue to require members of the House to wear masks on the chamber floor to steps the Nazis took to control the Jewish population during the Holocaust.

Greene, in a conversation with the Christian Broadcasting Network's David Brody Real America's Voice TV show ""The Water Cooler,"" attacked Pelosi and accused her of being a hypocrite for asking GOP members to prove they have all been vaccinated before allowing members to be in the House chamber without a mask.

""You know, we can look back at a time in history where people were told to wear a gold star, and they were definitely treated like second class citizens, so much so that they were put in trains and taken to gas chambers in Nazi Germany,"" Greene said. ""And this is exactly the type of abuse that Nancy Pelosi is talking about.""

Jewish groups were quick to condemn Greene's remarks. 

""You can never compare health-related restrictions with yellow stars gas chambers and other Nazi atrocities. Such comparisons demean the Holocaust and contaminate American political speech,"" the American Jewish Congress said in a tweet in response to Greene's comments. ""Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene must immediately retract and apologize.""

Serena Williams announces she will 'evolve away from tennis' after upcoming US Open
By Ben Morse

Serena Williams has announced that she will ""evolve away from tennis"" after this year's US Open to focus on ""other things that are important to me.""

In an article in Vogue, the 23-time grand slam winner said that, although she will try to win at the US Open, it is time for her to move ""in a different direction.""
""There comes a time in life when we have to decide to move in a different direction,"" Williams posted on Instagram with a picture of herself on the cover of Vogue with the title: 'Serena's Farewell...I'm terrible at goodbyes.'

""That time is always hard when you love something so much. My goodness do I enjoy tennis. But now, the countdown has begun. I have to focus on being a mom, my spiritual goals and finally discovering a different, but just exciting Serena. I'm gonna relish these next few weeks.""

The announcement comes a day after the 40-year-old won her first singles match in 430 days.

She played her first singles match in over a year at Wimbledon in June, losing to France's Harmony Tan. Afterwards, she hinted that she could play on home soil at the US Open, which begins August 29.

Novak Djokovic targets Pete Sampras' year-end world No. 1 record in Vienna
By George Ramsay

While unable to edge closer to Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal in the grand slam leaderboard in the second half of the tennis season, Novak Djokovic is chasing one record that could see him outstrip his rivals.

Djokovic needs to win just two matches at this week's Vienna Open to end the year as world No. 1 for the sixth time, equaling Pete Sampras' record set between 1993 and 1998.

The Serb is currently tied with Federer, Nadal -- whom he lost to in the final of the French Open earlier this month -- and Jimmy Connors on five year-ending No. 1 accolades, securing them in 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015 and 2018.
