The moment of the massive explosion that rocked the Lebanese capital Beirut, killing more than 137 people and injuring thousands, was captured in high definition by a shop owner who was recording when the blast hit.

Video shows smoke rising from Beirut's port with small sparks being seen in what is believed to be fireworks that were set off by the blaze. According to reports, fireworks were stored in the same warehouse where 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate had previously been stored. After several seconds of recording, a massive explosion bursts outwards, which then moves outwards towards where the shop owner is, the resulting shockwave impacting multiple buildings in the process.

At least seven people died from the chaos on the tarmac, U.S. officials said.
 
The crowds of people rushing the airport came as the Taliban enforced their rule over the wider capital after a lightning advance across the country that took just over a week to dethrone the country’s Western-backed government.
 
The U.S. military and other Western forces continued to organize evacuations.
 
The United Nations Security Council held a meeting on Monday to discuss the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on countries to take Afghan refugees.

Johnson told lawmakers that the restrictions were being eased because of the ""extraordinary booster campaign"" as well as because government scientists believed it was likely that the surge of Omicron infections “has now peaked nationally.""

“We will trust the judgment of the British people and no longer criminalize anyone who chooses not to wear one,” Johnson said on masks.

The government will no longer advise people to work from home and beginning next Thursday, mandatory COVID-19 passes will not be required to gain entry to large-scale events.

Londoners shared mixed views about the easing of restrictions.

Depp was awarded $15-million in total – $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages.

The jury also awarded Heard $2 million in compensatory damages, ruling that Depp’s lawyer Adam Waldman defamed her when he called her abuse claims “a hoax” in a British newspaper.

Depp, who is out touring, did not appear in the courtroom for the verdict. Heard, however, was in attendance.

43:23 Lawyers Ben Chew and Camille Vasquez celebrated the verdict outside court.

28,kJOU9YYMzpw,Global News,Apartheid: The rise and fall of South Africa's 'apartness' laws,2019-04-25T10:00:08Z,25,"South Africa is marking the 25th anniversary of the fall of apartheid in 2019.

Apartheid, the Afrikaans word for ""apartness,"" was made up of a collection of strict laws targeting visible minorities in the country and is viewed as one of the darkest periods in the nation's history.

For nearly half a century, non-white South Africans were stripped of their freedoms and suffered under government imposed restrictions.

The face of the anti-apartheid movement became Nelson Mandela - who was jailed as a political prisoner for 27 years - whom would later become the nation's president and an icon of freedom and justice.

So, how could institutionalized discrimination take hold in South Africa, and what steps were taken to bring an end to apartheid?

Dawna Friesen has more on Trudeau's message to Canadians. Plus, David Akin reports on Trudeau's promise to help those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and how the Bank of Canada is reacting to the crisis.

In an effort to control the spread of COVID-19 in Canada, the federal government is asking Canadians to eliminate all non-essential travel outside the country. Jeff Semple looks at some of the measures in place during the pandemic.

U.S. President Donald Trump has now declared a national emergency over COVID-19, which will free up $50 billion in aid, and waived restrictions for hospitals in their response. As Abigail Bimman reports, life in the country has largely ground to a halt.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared Europe the new epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic, as that continent reports more cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined, excluding China. Europe is also reporting more new cases every day than China did at the height of its epidemic. Crystal Goomansingh reports on the latest measures to keep people healthy.

As some countries and some Canadian provinces close schools due to COVID-19, questions are being raised about whether the rest of Canada should follow suit. As Ross Lord reports, the right approach is a lesson in itself.

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, concern is growing for Canadians living in remote regions of this country with limited access to medical services. Heather Yourex-West looks at what's being done to prepare Indigenous communities.

More than 130,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide and roughly half of the people who caught the virus have already recovered. Eric Sorensen looks at the silver linings of this seemingly dark time.

In November 2021, the Trudeau government announced that Canadian truckers crossing into the U.S. would need to be vaccinated or face a 14-day quarantine. The policy took effect last Saturday despite opposition from the trucking industry, which warned it could lead to supply chain issues. 

But as Brittany Rosen reports, the protest raises questions about the feasibility of restrictive public health decisions.

COVID-19 has now spread to at least 50 countries, making tens of thousands of people ill. Global News looks at the drastic steps governments around the globe are taking to mitigate the risks. Also, a woman in California has become America's first confirmed COVID-19 case of ""unknown"" origin. Jackson Proskow explains the mystery surrounding this case, how thousands of people in California are now being monitored and how the case exposes a gap in the country's response to the virus.

Meanwhile, in Canada, after weeks of protests and rail blockades, Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett is in northern B.C. to meet with the Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs opposed to the Coastal GasLink pipeline. As Sarah MacDonald reports, Bennett's visit comes just hours after the meeting was abruptly cancelled over what's been labelled a miscommunication. Plus, a rail blockade on Kahnawake Mohawk territory near Montreal is entering its third week, in a show of solidarity with Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs against Coastal GasLink's pipeline project in northern B.C. Mike Armstrong explains why a court injunction to remove protesters hasn't been acted upon.

Alberta's UCP government has tabled its second budget in just four months, as the province continues to suffer through a prolonged downturn in the oil and gas sector. But as Heather Yourex-West reports, the government says hope is on the horizon.

And Canadian feds have launched new protections for a certain aquatic creature. Ottawa is ramping up measures meant to protect endangered North Atlantic right whales, following the death of dozens in Canadian waters over the past three years. Ross Lord reports on the new rules, and why researchers say the new rules are similar to previous ones.

Tents have been set up for a massive weekend party where the bikers leave for their annual Canada Run bike ride. Police say bikers will have their motorcycles inspected and driver's licences checked — a power that police have under the Highway Traffic Act.
 
Hundreds of Hells Angels members snaked from through Toronto on Thursday for a memorial procession and subsequent gathering, under the watchful eye of police and causing traffic disruptions along the way.
 
The gathering was the culmination of a memorial ride for former Toronto chapter president Donny Petersen, who died last December at the age of 74. The outlaw bikers congregated at the unofficial clubhouse for the Toronto's Hells Angels, with their Harley-Davidson motorcycles and patches.

These types of balloons are not new. In fact, similar tactics have been used for espionage in the early days of the Cold War. Eric Sorensen takes a look at the balloon and explores why old-fashioned technology is being used in the age of sophisticated satellites.

There are new concerns over the worldwide spread of another virus: avian flu. For more than a year, there's been a significant uptick in cases among wild birds and farmed poultry. Now, there's new evidence the illness is spreading among other mammals. Heather Yourex-West reports.
