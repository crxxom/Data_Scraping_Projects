Chad and Amy Kempel already had 2 children when they found out that Amy was pregnant with quintuplets.

Before having their 7 children, the Kempels struggled with infertility. They had multiple miscarriages and lost twin boys at 22 weeks. Despite the odds, Amy carried her 5 babies to 27 weeks at which point doctors needed to intervene for medical reasons. The quintuplets were delivered by C-section 3 months early and spent 73 days in the NICU until they were ready to go home.

After the babies made it home safely, Chad and Amy had to figure out how to make it work. Amy chose to stay at home while Chad went to work each morning at 4am. So Chad came up with a variety of creative solutions to help streamline daily activities — including a prop feeding system and an end table with highchairs built in.

Chad shares his inventions on his YouTube channel, calling them Quint Hacks — see more here: https://www.youtube.com/user/ChadKempel.

In US news and current events today, teacher Amanda Coffman resigned on the spot during a school board meeting and delivered a powerful message to her former students. 

Coffman is a former teacher at Indian Woods Middle School in Kansas. She says she resigned because she felt ‘silenced’ when Shawnee Mission School District issued teachers new 3-year contracts. 

Coffman says the contracts don’t address the concerns or needs that the teachers have fought for in the past.

Listen to Amannda Coffman's fiery resignation speech to the Kansas school board here. Here is how she plans to continue the fight for better education in America.

In US news, high school graduate Nataly Buhr shocked the audience and the world with her San Ysidro High School valedictorian speech. The headlines will surely read 'Valedictorian shocks world with brutally honest speech,' because in this grad speech she called out teachers and school staff for being negligent and accused one faculty of being a drunk teacher. Buhr hoped students would find her graduation speech inspirational. A rep from Sweetwater Union High School District called the speech 'unfortunate.' Buhr is evidently not the teachers pet.

In US news, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, one of the many 2020 election candidates, appeared at a Fox News Channel town hall and the Fox News audience loved him. At the end of the Pete Buttigieg Fox News town hall, the audience gave him a stand ovation. One might argue that the Pete Buttigieg town hall on Fox News went better than Bernie Sanders'. In the Pete Buttigieg interview he answered questions about the electoral college and called out Laura Ingraham and Tucker Carlson. After the town hall, the Fox & Friends hosts and President Trump expressed their dismay at Buttigieg's warm reception.

In US news and current events today, President Donald J. Trump has claimed to be the smartest, most intelligent president in US history, though his knowledge of the country's past leaves somewhat to be desired. From his defense of Andrew Jackson, complete misunderstanding of the Confederacy and why the Confederate Army was fighting in the Civil War history, and numerous other inaccuracies about world history and U.S. history, this President Trump history lesson will no doubt leave you dumber about the state of history. For President Trump, smart is a state of mind, and while many have cast doubts on the President's intelligence, we'll let this Trump history lesson speak for itself.

In US news and current events today, the phenomenon known as never Trump Republicans, or Republican Voters Against Trump, also known as RVAT, are becoming a force to be reckoned with in the upcoming election 2020. President Trump has turned off a sizable portion of the Republican base, and as President, Donald Trump is know a known entity rather than the unknown he was before he became President Donald J. Trump. For these never Trumpers, the threat of another Trump term is very real, which is why they are speaking out against President Donald Trump.

In World news and current events today, world leaders from around the globe have condemned President Donald Trump and his response to the peaceful protest happening in front of the White House as a result of the police killing of George Floyd. 

The senseless act has sparked a movement of George Floyd protests and Black Lives Matter protests not just in America, but around the world, but no other leader has responded to the uprising with the same violent rhetoric as President Trump. From Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson of England, international leaders from Germany to the entire European Union have roundly condemned the violent response of Donald J. Trump and voiced support for Black Lives Matter, the BLM protests, and the fight for racial justice.
