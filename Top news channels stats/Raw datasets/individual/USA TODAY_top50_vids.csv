A Tampa woman who fought off an attacker at her apartment complex's gym is speaking out about her experience in the hopes that other women will feel more empowered.

Nashali Alma, 24, said she was exercising in her complex's gym, about 12 miles northwest of downtown Tampa, in late January when a man who looked familiar to her needed access to the gym, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office said.

Alma said she let the man in because she had seen him in the gym before. But as she was working out, Alma told investigators that the man approached her and grabbed her waist. Alma said she yelled at the man to get away from her but he kept chasing her around the gym, police said.

President Joe Biden approved Gov. Pedro Pierluisi's request for a major disaster declaration on Wednesday, opening up more federal assistance. Meanwhile, the Federal Emergency Management Agency announced it will send hundreds of personnel to aid local response efforts, while the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency.

Puerto Rico experienced widespread landslides, damaged homes, washed-out bridges and downed power lines as torrential rains and flooding engulfed the island. Power company officials initially said it would take a few days for electricity to be fully restored, but then appeared to backtrack late Tuesday night. Only 26% had power as of Wednesday morning, three days after it hit the island.

9,v-43wPyblUA,USA TODAY,"WATCH: Election results for Trump, Biden and key swing state races | USA TODAY",2020-11-05T09:31:23Z,25,"Results from the 2020 presidential election as Americans vote in races for the presidency, 11 governorships, 35 Senate seats and all 435 House seats.

Final polls show the race between President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden has tightened since mid-October, both nationally and in battleground states.

Biden's lead in USA TODAY's average of averages, which is based on data from RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight, reached double-digits on Oct. 12, but has since fallen back to a 7.5-percentage point lead. That leaves him back roughly in the same position USA TODAY found him in its first poll roundup on Sept. 28, when his polling average lead over Trump was 7.2 points. 

Beyond the presidency, Tuesday's election may result in changes in Congress, where Democrats want to regain control of the Republican-led Senate and Democrats hope to expand their advantage in the House.

30,A1DEd0iKC8Q,USA TODAY,"Election Night 2020: Coverage of Trump, Biden and key races | USA TODAY",2020-11-04T08:58:02Z,25,"Watch our continued coverage here https://youtu.be/Oj9GpZB9cuc

Results from the 2020 presidential election as Americans vote in races for the presidency, 11 governorships, 35 Senate seats and all 435 House seats.

Final polls show the race between President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden has tightened since mid-October, both nationally and in battleground states.

Biden's lead in USA TODAY's average of averages, which is based on data from RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight, reached double-digits on Oct. 12, but has since fallen back to a 7.5-percentage point lead. That leaves him back roughly in the same position USA TODAY found him in its first poll roundup on Sept. 28, when his polling average lead over Trump was 7.2 points. 

Beyond the presidency, Tuesday's election may result in changes in Congress, where Democrats want to regain control of the Republican-led Senate and Democrats hope to expand their advantage in the House.

RELATED: Zelenskyy appeals to European Union for 'immediate' membership https://bit.ly/3tfqgdo

Residential areas in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, were being pounded by Russian shells while a massive 40-mile convoy of Russian tanks and vehicles rolled toward the capital of Kyiv on Tuesday as the war entered its sixth day.

At least 11 people were killed and 35 wounded in the rocket strikes on Kharkiv, Interior Ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said. He said the rubble was still being cleared and the death toll was expected to rise.

Closed-circuit television footage showed a fireball engulfing a street in front of one building, and a few cars rolled out of the billowing smoke.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the attack on the city's main square “frank, undisguised terror. Nobody will forgive. Nobody will forget. This attack on Kharkiv is a war crime.”

At the urging of President Donald Trump, however, die-hard supporters are planning to descend on the nation's capital Jan. 6, to pressure Republican lawmakers into aligning themselves with the doomed effort to overturn Joe Biden's electoral victory.

Knife fights, shouting matches, and verbal harassment of Trump opponents accompanied previous demonstrations following Biden's election win in November. Now federal and local law enforcement are bracing for what may be the most intense Trump protest yet as Congress is poised to formally declare Biden president-elect.

The mayor appealed for calm Thursday as the city released body camera videos of last month's fatal shooting of Adam Toledo, 13, by a Chicago police officer - an incident that appears to show Adam's hands in the air when he was shot.

According to one officer's bodycam video, he pulls up in a car, gets out, pushes past another man and runs down an alley shouting ""stop"" toward Adam, who is dressed in jeans, a sweatshirt and white baseball cap. Adam runs away from the officer, then slows down and pauses near a fence.

Adam can be seen tossing what appeared to be a gun behind the fence as he slows down, according to surveillance video shot from across a parking lot. The video shows the gun coming to rest on the backside of the fence.
