The clip, which was shown of Faroese Television, has since gone viral, racking up millions of hits on YouTube alone. The dead whale had been lying on the beach for two days, after getting stuck in the waters between two islands, when marine biologist Bjarni Mikkelsen was sent to cut it open. As he made incisions in the whale's side the carcass exploded due to a buildup of methane gas from the decomposition creating a loud sound and releasing a pungent smell. It is reported that a local museum will collect the skeleton and put it on display. Report by Laurie Blake.

The Russia President presented Kim with a tea set. In return, Putin was gifted with a ceremonial sword. Putin and Kim said they had good talks about their joint efforts to resolve a standoff over Pyongyang's nuclear program, amid stalled negotiations with the United States. Kim's first trip to Russia comes about two months after his second summit with US President Donald Trump failed because of disputes over US-led sanctions on the North. Putin meanwhile wants to expand Russia's clout in the region and get more leverage with Washington.

However, a woman from Germany has avoided the 'unthinkable' and broken a world record instead. Julia Plecher, from Ruckersdorf, has run 100 metres in 14.531 seconds, wearing shiny golden heels. She has raced into the Guinness World Records and has been included in its 2014 book.

Julia has a history of running in heels. She took part in a 'stiletto race' in Berlin back in 2009, and despite the rule being a seven centimetre heel, she chose an 8.5 cm one. She ended up winning the race.

Julia has previously said the key to not falling over is unsurprisingly now the show is made.

""You need shoes which ideally are closed in the front because you run on the front part of the foot. You have to be careful not to slip out. I think sandals would not be too appropriate,"" Plecher said. Report by Ashley Fudge.

Paul and Rachel Chandler, the British couple kidnapped by Somali pirates, say their captors are ""losing patience"" as they wait for ransom negotiations to begin. 

In October 2009 the Chandlers set sail from the Seychelles for Tanzania. Ninety miles offshore, their small yacht was boarded by armed Somali pirates, who held them hostage on land for more than a year, demanding a ransom of millions.

They were held hostage for 388 days and freed when a private ransom was paid, mostly be members of their extended family.

13,R5aIpUVAwZs,On Demand News,Little Girl Lost: More than 600 people ignore lost child in TV experiment,2014-03-24T21:09:14Z,25,"In a social experiment for a TV documentary 616 people were filmed walking past two young girls, who were left alone in a London shopping centre. Seven-year-old Uma Rumsey and her sister, Maya, who's five, were taken to Victoria Place shopping centre, next to Victoria Station. They were left alone separately - but with tight security around them - obviously alone and looking in need of help. The cameras recorded men and women clearly seeing them - and ignoring them. A total of 616 adults passed them by in just one hour. The one person who did finally ask Maya if she needed help did so only after doubling back and making sure the child was alone. She was Pearl Pitcher, who said: ""I was very hesitant to come and ask her, but I thought I must come back - just in case. I think the older generation would stop, but very cautiously, a bit like I was"". A spokesman for the NSPCC said: ""We have got to get a message out to adults that they have a responsibility to protect children and that must supersede any concern you have for other people's perception of why you are reaching out to help that child"". The experiment, which was to test the public's reaction to lost children, was carried out for a programme by ITN Productions on Channel 5, called ""Little Girl Lost: A Police 5 Special"", which will air on Tuesday 25th March at 6.30pm.

State news agency Xinhau reported around 200 firefighters and police officers were involved in the search for his body.

He was due to take part in the second World Wingsuit Championship this week in Tianmen mountain where participants have to jump from 700-metre-high cliffs. Report by Ashley Fudge.

19,Ae9LyDU48Q4,On Demand News,7 Funny Moments You Missed From the G7 in Biarritz,2019-08-27T18:16:25Z,25,"From Indian Prime Minister Modi slapping US President Trumpâs hand to Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau going on a morning run, this yearâs G7 has been a very eventful one.

French President Emmanuel Macron was hosting the summit in the seaside city of Biarritz, and had set the agenda as âfighting inequalityâ.

As expected though, Brexit and a future trade deal took centre stage in the bilaterals.

The G7 brings together leaders from the UK, USA, Canada, Germany, Italy, France and Japan for an annual discussion.

Hereâs Part 2 of our hilarious collection of epic awkward moments throughout his career in politics.

With just weeks to go until the US election in November, Joe Biden's gaffes are still making headlines. He recently struggled to describe the impact of coronavirus at a rally in Pittsburgh, saying: âCOVID has taken this year just since the outbreak, has taken more than 100 years â look, here's the lives it's just it's just, I mean, think about it"".

But with Joe Biden defending a steady lead in the polls against President Donald Trump, will his gaffes get in the way of his bid for the White House?

Hereâs a hilarious collection of epic awkward moments throughout his career in politics.

From several out-of-place jokes to some seriously unfortunate incidents, former Vice-President Biden's goofiness is either considered charming or alarming by the US electorate. 

Ironically, in 2008 Mr Biden said that Hillary Clinton is âmore qualified than I am to be Vice-President of the United States of America.â

Maybe it helps that the then-President Barack Obama reacted to most of his gaffes with bemusement. 

However, could some of these embarrassing moments make his race for the White House against incumbent President Donald Trump more difficult?

42,YbfEvAmZs8g,On Demand News,Funny moments you missed from the Trump-Kim summit,2019-02-28T15:12:50Z,25,"Here are some of the lighter moments from the Trump-Kim summit in Hanoi. The highlights include jogging bodyguards, a Kim Jong-un lookalike being deported and Kim having a smoke break as his sister holds a crystal ashtray. Also we see Trump frantically waving a Vietnam flag and seemingly understanding Kim's jokes, even though Korean leader spoke in his native tongue. We see the pair enjoying a 'private dinner' in front of the gathered media, including one of the ""world's greatest photographers"". After the summit ended with no agreement we see Trump having an awkward moment with a bunch of flowers then stumbling slightly as enters Air Force One.

The fire started at around noon on the 7th and 8th floors of the building and rapidly engulfed three more floors, trapping several people inside.

Horrified onlookers watched from the street below as those in the building waved for help from the smoke-filled rooms.

Two men were filmed jumping from the building rather than face the flames. One died on impact and the other later in hospital.  Report by Matt Blake.

47,apSYJB0qWL0,On Demand News,Gareth Bale with Cristiano Ronaldo on first day of training at Real Madrid,2013-09-12T10:07:15Z,17,"After playing 30 minutes for Wales on Tuesday, Gareth Bale finally joined up with his new Real Madrid team-mates on Wednesday. Video released by the club showed a smiling Bale being greeted by team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo as he arrived at the Valdebebas training ground.

He was then greeted by manager Carlo Ancelotti and his assistant Zinedine Zidane at a pre-training session in a meeting room.

Bale then joined the rest of players for a two-hour session, where he met up with his former Spurs team-mate Luka Modric.

Only Ancelotti, and perhaps his coaching staff, know whether Bale will make his debut during Saturday's La Liga match against Villarreal.

But Wales boss Chris Coleman said on Wednesday that Bale is not fit enough to play a full 90 minutes.

Real have won their opening three La Liga matches under Ancelotti, who replaced Jose Mourinho at the end of last season. Report by Mark Morris.
