0,YAxL4TB6pmQ,The Young Turks,Spent: Looking For Change (Documentary),2014-06-04T14:08:17Z,25,"Spent: Looking for Change is a film about everyday Americans without the financial options most of us take for granted and the movement giving them renewed hope. To find out more and take action, visit http://spentmovie.com/.

Turning to pawn shops, check cashing services, and using payday loans to meet basic financial needs can be costly for many of us, with $89 billion a year going to fees and interest* for using these types of alternative financial services.

It's time for change. New technology, new ideas and encouraging dialogue around this issue can help make managing money simple and more affordable.

American Express is presenting this documentary to help improve financial inclusion in the United States. Academy Award¬Æ-winning filmmaker Davis Guggenheim is the executive producer of the documentary which is narrated by Tyler Perry and directed by Derek Doneen.

1,gTFljCRnGN4,The Young Turks,You'll Never Flirt The Same After Watching This,2014-04-16T02:45:36Z,25,"""Does Flirting Actually Work?

Very much so. In fact, research says it's more effective than looking good.

Signaling availability and interest trumps attractiveness. Via How to Make Someone Fall in Love With You in 90 Minutes or Less:

Dr. Monica Moore, a psychologist at Webster University in St. Louis, has conducted research on the flirting techniques used in singles bars, shopping malls, and places young people go to meet each other. She concluded that it's not the most physically appealing people who get approached, but the ones who signal their availability and confidence through basic flirting techniques like eye contact and smiles. Just signaling your interest in someone gets you halfway there, whether you're a man or a woman.""* The Young Turks hosts Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian break it down.

""Multiple supporters of President Donald Trump over the past couple of weeks have taken to Twitter to air their grievances about the president‚Äôs signature tax cut plan.

Even though the 2017 GOP tax cut is leading to spiking federal deficits thanks to its generous benefits to corporations, many middle-class Americans are winding up having to pay more because the bill eliminated multiple deductions used by middle-class families to lower their annual tax payments.

Among other things, the tax bill capped deductions for taxes paid to state and local governments, while massively increasing the amount of money you must donate to qualify for a charitable giving deduction.""

""Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado told Fox News on Wednesday she intended to take legal action against the political action committee widely credited with making Madison Cawthorn the youngest member of Congress to lose a primary.

Following Cawthorn's defeat in May, the American Muckrakers PAC announced they were targeting Boebert, who is also a first-term Republican.

On Tuesday, the PAC published salacious allegations about Boebert working through a ""sugar daddy"" website prior to her election to Congress.

The group said ""their team and volunteers have uncovered that Lauren Boebert was an unlicensed, paid escort and met clients through SugarDaddyMeet.com. Text messages show she was bankrupt at the time and looking for some 'side income' and called her work 'pay to play.' She was paid to 'escort' with wealthy men,"" the group alleged.""

""We did not develop this medicine for Indians...we developed it for western patients who can afford it,"" he said back in December. The quote is quickly making its way across Indian news outlets.

The comment was in response to a decision by an Indian patent court that granted a compulsory license to a local company to reproduce Bayer's drug.""* The Young Turks hosts Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian break it down.

""CNN‚Äôs Alisyn Camerota moderated a Donald Trump voter focus group on Tuesday, and the discussion became a free-for-all when the president‚Äôs supporters sparred with those who have come to regret backing him in 2016.

The panel was an even split of backers and critics, and Arthur Schaper started things off by lauding Trump‚Äôs performance in office so far. These plaudits were countered by Jeremy Montanez, who called Trump a bigoted ‚Äúmonster‚Äù while slamming the White House‚Äôs separation of migrant families at the southern border.

The panel ended up holding a conversation about illegal immigration and migrant parents who had their children taken away even though they tried crossing the border through the proper legal channels. This segued into a debate about whether Trump is responsible for the increasing levels of divisiveness around the country.‚Äù*

‚ÄúWhat good is it if FOX News speaks well of me when they continually allow horrible and untruthful anti-Trump commercials to be run ‚Äî and plenty of them,‚Äù Trump said in a statement. ‚ÄúIn the good old days, that would never have happened and today it happens all of the time.‚Äù

""President Trump‚Äôs two sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, who were born into wealth and work at a company their grandfather founded, have spent the last few weeks contending for the title of World‚Äôs Least Self-Aware Person.

First, one of them goes on TV or Twitter and attacks Hunter Biden for trading on his father‚Äôs name, brushing aside their own histories of doing the same. Then the other one goes on TV or Twitter and wags their finger at Joe Biden allowing his son to profit off his name, never mentioning that their sister and brother-in-law are senior White House officials whose companies are raking in cash as they help craft U.S. policy. With each appearance, the irony and sanctimony are ratcheted up.

The brotherly competition reached its apex Wednesday night when Don Jr., who became an executive vice-president at his father‚Äôs company at the age of 23, appeared on Sean Hannity‚Äôs Fox News show and said this: ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre the father and your son‚Äôs entire career is dependent on that, they own you.‚Äù*

17,TVdD4wRKnaI,The Young Turks,Marijuana Study Reports Positive And Negative Findings,2014-10-12T00:00:00Z,25,"""On Monday, the scientific journal Addiction released a sweeping new review of 20 years of research into the recreational use of marijuana. Dr. Wayne Hall, director of the Centre for Youth Substance Abuse Research at the University of Queensland and an adviser to the World Health Organization, began the review in 1993. At that time, there were ‚Äúvery few epidemiological studies of the health effects of cannabis,‚Äù he says. The existing scientific literature was ‚Äúdominated‚Äù by ‚Äúanimal studies from the 1970s,‚Äù and the only human laboratory studies available were from the late ‚Äô70s and early ‚Äô80s. And even those analyzed only ‚Äúthe effects of sustained cannabis use over 7‚Äì35 days on the health of college students.‚Äù

What changed to make a review like this possible? Two things: First, people are smoking more weed. ‚ÄúDuring the past half-century,‚Äù the authors say, ‚Äúrecreational cannabis use has become almost as common as tobacco use among adolescents and young adults,‚Äù which means there are simply more weed smokers to study.‚Äù *

‚ÄúThe Pentagon is rolling out military hardware for a Fourth of July unlike any other. Tanks on the National Mall and military flyovers will be part of the capital's celebration, by order of President Trump. He'll be the first president to take an active role in any July Fourth ceremony in recent memory.

These flyovers cost tens of thousands of dollars per hour, though military officials say they are essentially training flights and therefore not an extra cost to taxpayers. But the National Park Service is reportedly diverting nearly $2.5 million, originally intended for parks across the country, for the celebration.

""Certainly going to be more expensive than previous years. Anytime you get a presidential visit there are inherent security costs,"" said Mark Litterst of the National Park Service.

The National Park Service said on Tuesday it was still waiting for the run of show from the White House ‚Äì proof this is a show, one stage-managed by the president down to the placement of tanks and infantry vehicles and the sequence of military flyovers, reports CBS News' Major Garrett. The Fourth of July is typically nonpartisan and a tribute to America's founding documents and self-government. 
 
The event is being called is called a ""Salute to America"" but Mr. Trump has made it clear that  the military will be front and center. ""We have some incredible equipment, military equipment on display ‚Äì brand new. And we're very proud of it,"" Mr. Trump said.‚Äù

‚Äú(CNN) Friday's airing of ABC's The View appeared to get a little more heated than normal. During the episode, Meghan McCain walked off the set as cameras panned the studio heading into a commercial.

It's unclear why McCain walked off the stage, but right before the break she and guest host Ana Navarro got into a disagreement as the group discussed whistleblowers and leakers, including WikiLeaks' Julian Assange.

As the panel voiced their opinions regarding McCain's comments, McCain tried to clarify as she talked over the other hosts: ""Excuse me, maybe I was clumsy in the way that I said it.‚Äù

Navarro responded, telling her that she ""didn't have to yell.""

‚ÄúLOS ANGELES (KABC) -- President Donald Trump attended a fundraising dinner in Beverly Hills and made an appearance at his privately owned golf club in Rancho Palos Verdes on Friday. 

Trump made the visit to Los Angeles after touring a section of recently rebuilt border fencing in Calexico. 

The president's rare visit to California is part of a renewed push to make border security a central campaign issue for his 2020 re-election. 

""There is indeed an emergency on our southern border,"" Trump said at the briefing, adding that there has been a sharp uptick in illegal crossings. ""It's a colossal surge and it's overwhelming our immigration system, and we can't let that happen. ... We can't take you anymore. We can't take you. Our country is full.""

Since President Trump took office, black unemployment has hit a historic low and currently sits at about 6.7 percent. And by the way, he's not satisfied with that. He wants it a lot lower but still pretty great. The number of African Americans employed is up more than 4 percent. And the most stunning of all African American wages. This is my favorite are up more than 9 percent. Here now in a truly special debate, I'm so happy about this.

""Several times in the first year of his administration, President Donald Trump wanted to call Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the middle of the afternoon. But there was a problem. Midafternoon in Washington is the middle of the night in Tokyo ‚Äî when Abe would be fast asleep.

Trump‚Äôs aides had to explain the issue, which one diplomatic source said came up on ‚Äúa constant basis,‚Äù but it wasn‚Äôt easy.

‚ÄúHe wasn‚Äôt great with recognizing that the leader of a country might be 80 or 85 years old and isn‚Äôt going to be awake or in the right place at 10:30 or 11 p.m. their time,‚Äù said a former Trump NSC official. ‚ÄúWhen he wants to call someone, he wants to call someone. He‚Äôs more impulsive that way. He doesn‚Äôt think about what time it is or who it is,‚Äù added a person close to Trump.

In the case of Abe and others, Trump‚Äôs NSC staffers would advise him, for instance, that ‚Äúthe time is messed up, it‚Äôs 1 o‚Äôclock in the morning‚Äù and promise to put the call on his calendar for a more diplomatically appropriate time. Former national security adviser H.R. McMaster would assure him: ‚ÄúWe can try to set it up.‚Äù

""When Vice President Mike Pence flew to Europe as the stand-in for President Trump at the 80th anniversary of the start of World War II, it appeared to be another sign that the famously fickle president trusted his vice president.

But Pence‚Äôs decision while in Ireland to stay at the Trump golf resort in Doonbeg, the area his grandfather emigrated from a century ago, caught Washington insiders as another act of fealty from a vice president derided at times as overly obsequious, even ‚Äúoleaginous.‚Äù

On the surface, Trump and Pence insist they have a great relationship and are working closer than ever to win reelection in 2020. (They‚Äôve consistently beaten back rumors that former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley is in the running to replace Pence on the 2020 ticket.)""

‚ÄúFor Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the very notion that President Donald Trump could be deserving of impeachment seemed ""laughable"" earlier this week.

After having read a summary of the July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that sparked House Democrats' impeachment inquiry into the president, McConnell said on Wednesday that it was ""laughable to think this is anywhere close to an impeachable offense.""
