0,ZlRObEeuuJM,Al Jazeera English,Is Bangladesh a one-party state? | Head to Head,2019-03-01T05:37:50Z,25,"In this episode of Head to Head, Mehdi Hasan challenges Gowher Rizvi, the International Affairs advisor to the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, on the state of the country’s democracy and whether it is heading towards authoritarianism.

Once one of the poorest countries in the region, Bangladesh’s economy has been booming over the last decade, with economic growth faster than its neighbours, India and Pakistan. It also boasts lower infant mortality and longer life expectancy than its peers. 

However, human rights groups warn that the country is becoming increasingly autocratic, accusing the government of clamping down on any form of dissent and hounding and locking up its political rivals. 

In recent elections Bangladesh’s ruling party, the Awami League, reasserted its power following a landslide general election victory. The opposition rejected the results, amid violence which saw 17 killed and allegations of vote-rigging and intimidation. 

Our guest on Head to Head is Gowher Rizvi, close ally of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and advisor on international affairs.  Mr Rizvi is also a renowned historian and former Oxford University scholar.  

We challenge Mr Rizvi on Sheikh Hasina’s government’s record in office and whether it is increasingly trying to silence its critics. We also ask him about the ongoing Rohingya crisis, where over 1 million refugees have fled Myanmar and are living in camps in Bangladesh. Is Bangladesh doing enough to help?

We are joined by a panel of three experts:

Saida Muna Tasneem, Bangladesh's High Commissioner to the UK and Ireland.

Abbas Faiz, South Asia analyst at Essex University, previously worked for Amnesty International for more than 30 years.

Tasneem Khalil, Swedish Bangladeshi journalist, author of Jallad: Death Squads and State Terror in South Asia.

Is Bangladesh a one-party state? with Gohwer Rizvi will be broadcast on March 1 at 20:00 GMT and will be repeated on March 2nd at 12:00 GMT, March  3rd at 01:00 GMT and March 4th at 06:00 GMT.

Head to Head is Al Jazeera's forum for ideas, a gladiatorial contest tackling big issues such as faith, nationalism, democracy and foreign intervention, in front of an opinionated audience at the Oxford Union.

2,i-DibXXjW4g,Al Jazeera English,Algerian Wedding | Al Jazeera World,2014-06-25T13:00:37Z,25,"A rare glimpse at people's daily lives in western Algeria as we go behind the scenes at three different weddings.

Summer in Algeria - the largest Arab country in the world and the biggest in the African continent - is a popular time of year for traditional, elaborate weddings, particularly in the lead-up to Ramadan.

At the heart of these celebrations are the brides with their hand-made outfits, their jewellery and the henna parties; as well as the delicious food that accompanies every step of the marriage process. Plus the music and armed horsemen in tribal war dress.

This colourful film takes us through the rituals and significance of Algerian traditions by following three different wedding ceremonies.

We speak to heritage researchers about Algeria's marriage traditions and see how engagements and arrangements are formalised. This film is an intimate look at the preparations and rituals of these rich and sumptuous family celebrations.

5,866fXIAZsDk,Al Jazeera English,Piracy in Nigeria | People & Power,2016-11-17T11:06:25Z,24,"The event followed a now familiar pattern: a small convoy of dusty 4x4 vehicles drove on to the edge of the airstrip at Galkayo in Puntland, north-central Somalia; armed security guards took up watchful positions nearby and a number of bemused-looking men stepped gingerly from the cars and lined up to have their photographs taken by the media.

On this occasion there were 11 of them; all had been hostages until that morning. They were sailors from a Malaysian cargo vessel that had been hijacked by Somali pirates a few years ago and held until a ransom was paid for their release.

One of them gave a brief account of what had happened. ""On November 26, 2010 our ship was hijacked in the Indian Ocean. Their demand was 20 million. After that, they threatened the owner. You now increase money or we will shoot the crew. The owner didn't increase the money and then one Indian is shot with just three bullets. Then they hit us and tortured us. Tell your family to bring us money, otherwise we will kill you!""

The crew had been held for three and a half years but they were the fortunate ones. Five of their crew mates had died in that time. Now the survivors were going home and a UN plane with two envoys on board was flying in to see them to safety.

Such scenes have become relatively commonplace in Galkayo in recent times. Eighty percent of global trade is carried by sea and Somalia sits on a key maritime route linking Europe and Asia. More than 18,000 ships pass its shores every year. Over the past decade, Somali pirates, often former fishermen whose traditional livelihoods have been destroyed by foreign trawlers and toxic waste dumping, have attacked more than 300 vessels and kidnapped 700 people.

Faced with such a threat, the international community responded aggressively. In 2008, European states, the US and others began sending naval forces to these seas. They are still there today - warships, planes and helicopters patrolling thousands of square miles and doing a fair job of keeping the hijackers at bay. The UN and others have also played an increasing role in facilitating negotiations for the release of hostages - such as those set free at places such as Galkayo - for whose liberty large ransoms have been paid.

But if the problem is now slowly coming under control in Somalia, the same cannot be said for other parts of the world where piracy is on the increase. Lawlessness, desperation, poverty, greed and even political radicalism have brought the phenomenon to the waters of South America, Asia and, perhaps most aggressively, to West Africa.  

In an effort to understand the reasons why, Bertrand Monnet, a French academic and filmmaker, has been travelling to piracy hot spots around the coast of Africa. In an extraordinary and very tense series of encounters, he came to face to face with heavily armed pirate gangs operating in and around the Niger Delta, where Nigeria's huge offshore oil industry, which employs thousands of expatriates, offers rich ransom pickings. It gradually became clear that piracy in West Africa has many of the same root causes as piracy in Somalia and elsewhere, not least of which is that those who don't share in the benefits and profits of global trade have ever fewer reasons these days to respect the security of those who do.

8,wp4YZdSz2aA,Al Jazeera English,Plastic Surgery: The Cost of Beauty | 101 East,2014-08-22T14:40:02Z,24,"Seoul, South Korea's capital, is at the heart of a growing obsession to look perfect.

In the Apgujeong district of Seoul, the streets are lined with endless rows of plastic surgery clinics. Business is booming. In South Korea, v-shaped jaws, double eyelids and dimpled smiles are all the rage and people from across the nation, and the world, are flocking to the clinics for plastic surgery, supporting an industry worth $5bn a year.

More than 4,000 clinics provide cosmetic surgery in Seoul, with an estimated 650,000 people a year going under the knife.

But the surgeries performed by some of the clinics do not always live up to patients' expectations and the quest for beauty and profits is putting lives at risk.

So Yi Yoon has suffered many medical problems since having plastic surgery, including not being able to close one of her eyes. She now works two jobs to pay off her debts and is suffering from depression.

On this edition of 101 East, we look at what is driving the growth of this booming business and at what price to individuals and the wider Korean society?

101 East delves into Korea's plastic surgery craze and uncovers the real price of pursuing physical perfection.

Pegasus is manufactured by an Israeli technology company called the NSO Group and is among the most advanced spyware in the world. It can access and infiltrate a smartphone without the owner clicking a link, opening an email or even answering their phone - meaning it can go undetected.

12,NRmGfmqx29g,Al Jazeera English,Saudi Aramco: The Company and the State,2019-02-01T19:58:16Z,25,"For the past two years, Saudi Arabia has prepared to place its national oil company on the stock market. Officials talked up the Saudi Aramco initial public offering (IPO) with international exchanges and global banks. It seemed like a great idea that the world's largest oil producing company, valued at $2 trillion, would become the world's largest ever traded stock.

There are many companies in the world which move and shake markets but perhaps no other organization essential to running a country. Aramco is unique and it runs no ordinary country. Saudi Arabia plays a key role in moving global oil prices. The oil market affects everyone on the planet directly or indirectly. Oil prices have developed and destroyed economies – Sudan and Venezuela being the most recent examples. So that company shedding its cloak of secrecy and deciding to go public is a huge deal. Specially for Saudi Arabia which is run by a monarchy and its affairs cannot be publicly evaluated or scrutinized.

The proposed listing of the national champion was a central part of the young Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030, a reform drive aimed at restructuring the kingdom's economy and reducing its dependence on oil revenue. 

""I think there was a strong case for the IPO and there still is for the selling of a stake of Saudi Aramco and there are lots of reasons for it,"" explains Jim Krane, an energy researcher at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy. While Saudi Arabia, like other Gulf states have been trying to move away their economies from oil dependency for years, ""the specter of climate action has finally made the Saudis get serious about it. And really the only way to diversify is through Aramco and Aramco is the source of revenues that the Saudi state needs to build other economic sectors.""

The Kingdom holds about 16 percent of the world’s oil reserves and is the largest exporter of petroleum among OPEC countries. Nearly half of the country's GDP comes from oil and Aramco itself employs 65,000 people.

The concerns about radical changes in strategy put a spanner in the works for Saudi Aramco's public listing. For the first time in its history, an IPO would bring full public disclosure of Aramco's financial details, a feat that has never been made public.

""Probably the biggest downside is the transparency that would have resulted around Saudi oil reserves,"" says Krane, a number that doesn't move beyond 260 billion barrels. ""If Saudi Aramco would have listed shares on the NYSE or the London stock exchange, the regulators would have forced Saudi Arabia to come clean on all of its reserves, how much of that is proven probable or otherwise.""

A lot has changed since Mohammed bin Salman's international public relations drive such as the imprisonment of top Saudi businessmen, the murde r of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the continued wa r on Yemen, and the Saudi-led blockade on neighbouring Qatar. That has resulted in a flight of capital, reduced foreign investment, increased Saudi borrowing and a halt on Saudi Aramco's IPO.

This is not the first time reforms have been promised in Saudi Arabia. ""In many ways, Mohammed bin Salman resembles his grandfather Abdul Aziz al-Saud,"" according to Chas Freeman, former US Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. The late leader united the country ""with tribal marriages...conducted a wa r in the Saudi south, which took land from Yemen...suppressed religious uprisings and it worked."" Whether his grandson's current ambitions will work is ""unknown,"" says Freeman.

Aramco owns the largest refinery in the US, Motiva, and hundreds of facilities across the globe and funds universities, think-tanks, lobbying firms and controls a vast media empire. That money shapes policy and perceptions while also covering up criticism of the kingdom.

Saudi Aramco's failure to launch and a young leader's stumble from one crisis to another are directly linked. There is an urgency to rush into things but also a lack of experience. ""That is really like planning for the growth of a nation, not the exit of an IPO,"" says Chad Brownstein, a hydrocarbon investment analyst and CEO of Rocky Mountain Resources. ""And the growth of a nation takes a lot more planning than a couple of months.""

Saudi Aramco: The Company and the State examines the reasons behind the ambitious offering, the politics of Saudi oil, the strategic importance of Aramco, a faulty evaluation, the challenges of transparency and what it means for an ambitious Prince's 'Vision 2030'.

13,yZs4PqKlph0,Al Jazeera English,What is the human cost to China's economic miracle? | Head to Head,2019-03-15T12:57:48Z,25,"In this episode of Head to Head, Mehdi Hasan challenges Charles Liu, Senior Fellow at Peking University, seasoned Chinese entrepreneur and informal adviser to the Chinese government, on Xi Jinping’s record in power so far, the government’s crackdown on the Uighur Muslim minority, and what role for China if it becomes the 21st century’s military and economic superpower.

With the presidential term limit abolished in 2018, critics say that Chinese President Xi Jinping appears to be paving the way to being able to stay in power for life, but Charles Liu, founder of Hao Capital, disputes this. Separately, despite lower-than-predicted growth, China is still growing substantially and is set to become the world’s biggest economy.

But the economic boom has been paired with an increase in state surveillance and crackdowns on dissent, as well as the repression of the Muslim Uighur minority. So at what cost has China’s economic miracle come? And what’s the future for civil liberties of the Chinese people?

In recent years China has also increased its military spending while some Chinese officials have been ratcheting up their militaristic rhetoric, raising fears of direct military confrontation with the United States.

On this Head to Head episode filmed at the Oxford Union, we challenge Charles Liu on all these topics, ask him whether the Chinese economy has hit a wall, and whether China’s neighbours should dismiss their fears as his country builds up its military and extends its global reach.

We are joined by a panel of three experts:

Andreas Fulda - China Specialist at Asia Research Institute and Assistant Professor at the School of Politics and International Relations, University of Nottingham.  

Victor Gao - Vice President of the Beijing based Center for China and Globalization and former interpreter for the late President Deng Xiaoping.

New alliances are being formed that until recently would have been unimaginable. But as the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and, potentially, Sudan forge closer relationships with Israel, where does this leave the Palestinians, particularly those in Gaza? How is Hamas - the elected government of Gaza - and its paramilitary wing, the Qassam Brigades, adjusting to the new regional political climate? In this film, Al Jazeera Arabic’s Tamer Almisshal meets Hamas’s political leader Ismail Haniya and discovers dramatic and surprising military preparations that may seriously concern Israel and its allies.

Today, the Gaza Strip is blockaded by the two countries bordering Gaza, Israel and Egypt, but it somehow continues to obtain rocket technology, some of it homemade, some smuggled in. Tamer Almisshal has obtained video of rockets being manufactured in Gaza. Iran is cited as a likely supplier but the source of some of this weaponry is unexpected. While clearing damage from the 2014 Gaza War, the Qassam Brigades came across unexploded Israeli missiles and say they have repurposed them into a source of arms. Hamas explains how another arms supply was sourced by a specialist unit of Palestinian divers, who were tasked with searching the seabed for weaponry and who claim to have recovered projectiles from the hold of century-old sunken ships.

Trump has made promises to more than double previous economic growth, revive industries like coal, and slash the debt and the deficit. But has he delivered? The national debt is now skyrocketing to levels not seen since World War II and the trade war with China has experts fearing a global recession.

""Trump makes grandiose promises,"" Moore told Hasan. ""He exaggerates and sometimes I wish he wouldn’t do that. But if you compare where the economy is today versus where it was when he entered office, it’s substantially stronger.""

Moore, a conservative commentator and economist at the Heritage Foundation, is also an adviser to the Trump 2020 re-election campaign.

He told Hasan he helped write immigration legislation, referring to a bill supported by President Trump and introduced by Republican senators. Moore, however, said he does not agree with some of the government’s positions on immigration.

When challenged on policies limiting legal immigration and the dire situation in migrant detention centres at the US-Mexico border, Moore said conditions in every centre he visited had been humane.

""But I do believe that until we get the border secure and we get that wall built, once we do that, we can increase our legal immigration.""

When pressed further on the numerous false statements Trump has made, like needing an ID to buy a box of cereal and suggesting that wind turbines cause cancer, Moore said, ""Donald Trump would be better off to stop talking so much and let his record speak for itself"".

""What I'm saying is, what Americans care about is his performance, his results, not what he says and how he acts,"" he added.

This is the first Head to Head episode with an audience recorded in the United States and marks the beginning of a new series. It takes place in front of an audience at the George Washington University in Washington DC.

We are joined by a panel of three experts:

- Tiffany Cross - liberal commentator, co-founder and managing editor of the US news outlet, The Beat DC
- Rick Wilson - former political strategist for the Republican Party, conservative critic of President Trump, and author of Everything Trump Touches Dies

In 1967, at the height of the Arab-Israeli Six-Day War, the Israeli Air Force launched an unprovoked attack on the USS Liberty, a US Navy spy ship that was monitoring the conflict from the safety of international waters in the Mediterranean.

Israeli jet fighters hit the vessel with rockets, cannon fire and napalm, before three Israeli torpedo boats moved in to launch a second more devastating attack. Though she did not sink, the Liberty was badly damaged. Thirty-four US servicemen and civilian analysts were killed, another 171 were wounded.

Later Israel apologised for what it claimed to be a tragic case of mistaken identity. It said that it had believed the ship to be hostile Egyptian naval vessel. US President Lyndon Johnson was privately furious but publicly the White House chose not to challenge the word of its closest Middle East ally and accepted that the attack had been a catastrophic accident.

However, as this exclusive Al Jazeera investigation reveals, fresh evidence throws new light on exactly what happened that fateful day – and the remarkable cover up that followed.

19,U0Xn60Zw03A,Al Jazeera English,Dawkins on religion: Is religion good or evil? | Head to Head,2012-12-23T07:44:44Z,25,"With the headlines covering fanaticism, fundamentalism, superstition and ignorance, religion is getting a bad press these days. And much of the conflict in the world, from the Middle East to Nigeria and Myanmar, is often blamed on religion.

But how are things from a different perspective? Some defenders of religion claim Adolf Hitler was an atheist. Communism under Joseph Stalin, Pol Pot or Mao Zedong banned religion, but also massacred millions. And science brought incredible and amazing advances, but also pollution and the atomic bomb.

A critic of religious dogmatism, Professor Richard Dawkins revolutionised genetics in 1976 with the publication of The Selfish Gene. He has since written 12 more bestsellers, including The God Delusion which sold millions of copies, was translated into more than 30 languages, and catapulted him to the position of the world's foremost atheist.

Mehdi Hasan challenges evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins at the Oxford Union in front of a varied and lively audience.

In a frank and at times heated exchange, they discuss: Is religion a force for good or evil? Can it co-exist with science? Is science the new religion? And why if god does not exist, is religion so persistent?

The attacks began on Thursday after Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a televised address that he had approved a “special military operation”. The move came after Moscow earlier recognised rebel-held territories in Luhansk and Donetsk and said they had asked for its “help”.
Russian missiles rained down on Ukrainian cities. Ukraine reported columns of troops pouring across its borders into the eastern Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Luhansk regions, and landing by sea at the cities of Odesa and Mariupol in the south.
Russian troops attacked Ukraine from Belarus, as well as from Russia with Belarusian support. An attack was also being launched from the annexed Crimean Peninsula, Ukraine’s border guard service said.

At the centre of it is a self-made Indian billionaire - Dr BR Shetty.

As founder of New Medical Centre Health (NMC), Shetty built relationships with the UAE's all-powerful sheikhs that appeared to open doors. Business was booming and, in 2012, NMC was the first Abu Dhabi company to be listed on the London Stock Exchange. The Initial Public Offering (IPO) raised $186m and raised NMC's market value to more than $8bn.

The first rumblings of financial trouble, however, came in December 2019 when an American investment firm published a damning report on NMC's finances. NMC's shares plummeted by 48 percent, wiping $1.5bn off the Shetty family fortune.

In April 2020, NMC Health went into administration in the United Kingdom for insolvency. Later that month, the UAE Central Bank ordered the seizure of all of Shetty and his family's assets and Shetty left the country. He now sees himself as the victim, claiming alleged fraud and misconduct within NMC - and has promised to clear his name and restore his business reputation.",1549159,8669,,1325,PT45M17S

27,U2K-afWJbXY,Al Jazeera English,Malaysia: Power and Corruption | 101 East,2019-05-09T09:55:31Z,25,"In 2018, after more than 60 years being ruled by the same party, Malaysians voted out Najib Razak and his government - the catalyst, the disappearance of billions of dollars of public funds involving Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund, 1MDB.

Police raids on Najib's family homes after the election seized more than $270m  worth of cash and luxury goods including Hermes Birkin handbags worth in excess of $10m and 12,000 pieces of jewellery - valued at more than $100m.

For internationally acclaimed Malaysian cartoonist Zunar, none of this came as a surprise. For years, his cartoons portrayed images of government corruption and the extravagance of Najib's wife, Rosmah.

Under Najib's government, Zunar faced nine criminal charges for his cartoons, carrying sentences totalling more than 43 years in jail - such was the crackdown on those who dared to speak out.

Now a free man, he says that Rosmah had been ""the most powerful person in Malaysia"" when she was First Lady.

A controversial Malaysian businessman, Deepak Jaikishan, who claims to have been Rosmah's confidant and her and Najib's business partner, backs up Zunar. Accusing the couple of benefitting from government deals, he says, ""It went to a point where every project had to go through her. Any cabinet minister who defied her or dared to voice out against her was just x-ed off. You could say she's the de facto prime minister.""

Najib currently faces more than 40 criminal charges, from money laundering to abuse of power, while his wife Rosmah faces 19 charges for money laundering and tax evasion. Both continue to deny all charges.

101 East lifts the curtain on the alleged corruption of the former Prime Minister, Najib Razak, and his wife, Rosmah, and investigates how key institutions were rendered powerless as the nation's coffers were robbed.

28,SuplOE5JB4M,Al Jazeera English,The Caliph P2: Division | Featured Documentary,2016-07-22T08:07:53Z,24,"The Caliph - Part 2: Division - Featured Documentary 

For almost 13 centuries, from the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 to the overthrow of the last Ottoman caliph in 1924, the Islamic world was ruled by a caliph.
 
Translated from the Arabic ‘Khalifa’, the word ‘caliph’ means successor or deputy.
The caliph was considered the successor to the Prophet Muhammad.
 
It is a term that has, at times, been abused.
 
In June 2014, a militant group calling itself the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (known as ISIL or ISIS) declared the establishment of a caliphate and proclaimed its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, a caliph. This proclamation was rejected by the overwhelming majority of the world’s Muslims.
 
ISIL had attempted to appropriate a title imbued with religious and political significance – and in doing so had cast a dark shadow over a rich history.
 
This is the story of the caliph, a title that originated 1,400 years ago and that spanned one of the greatest empires the world has ever known.

In this episode of The Caliph, Al Jazeera tells the story of the caliphate, looking at the Sunni-Shia divide, and how this split arose from a dispute over who should succeed the Prophet Muhammad.

31,asGHu2NzvbI,Al Jazeera English,Islamophobia in Europe: Why won't Poland take in any Muslims? | UpFront,2019-11-08T11:52:18Z,25,"In this episode of UpFront, we ask Polish politician Dominik Tarczynski about his government's immigration policy and anti-Muslim rhetoric.

And in our Arena, Rim-Sarah Alouane and Benjamin Haddad discuss what's behind the ongoing debate over secularism in France.

Polish MP: 'For me, multiculturalism is not a value'
Poland's ultra-conservative Law and Justice Party (PiS) won a second term in office last month, a victory that critics fear will accelerate the country's slide towards authoritarianism.

The PiS rose to power in 2015, following a campaign that focussed on social conservatism, along with a generous social spending programme.

But the party's refusal to take in refugees, along with its attempts to reform the judiciary - critics say at the expense of independence - has put it at loggerheads with the European Union.

Just this week a top EU legal adviser said Warsaw broke the bloc’s law by refusing to take in refugees during Europe's 2015 migrant crisis.

But the PiS's Domink Tarczynski insists his country did nothing wrong, and says Poland stands by its immigration policy.

""We don't want Poland being taken over by Muslims, Buddhists, or someone else ... and no one will ever force us to take Muslims, Buddhists, non-believers in huge numbers,"" said Tarczynski.

Tarczynski says after living in the UK and the US and experiencing life in a multicultural society, he doesn't see any value in it.

""For me, multicultural society, it's not a value … it's not a virtue,"" the Polish MP said. ""Christian culture, Roman law, Greek philosophers, these are the virtues for us.""

This week's Headliner is member of parliament for Poland's governing Law and Justice Party, Dominik Tarczynski.

France, secularism and hijab paranoia
The debate over Muslim women wearing the veil has been reignited in France, after a mother was verbally abused last month by a far-right politican during her son's school trip to a regional assembly. The politician demanded the woman remove her headscarf or leave.

Wearing the veil - known as the hijab - is banned in French schools and government offices.

Politicians are now examining a proposed law that would ban parents from wearing religious symbols by parents on school trips.

The legislation has little chance of passing, but it has put the issue of French secularism, embodied in the principle of 'laicite', firmly back in the spotlight.

Critics see a worrying trend where 'laicite' could enter more areas of French society.

""We are witnessing a transformation of 'laicite' into a legal monster that it was not aimed to be when the law was implemented,"" said human rights researcher Rim-Sarah Alouane, who focuses on religious freedom and civil liberties.

""We have religious freedom at stake, but also constant harassment and targeting of a part of our population,"" she added.

Benjamin Haddad, a director at the Atlantic Council, says the law does target Muslims, and agrees it should not be extended, but he says it should be acceptable to have a political debate about what some see as problems with integration.

""You have a lot of secular Muslim women who say that they feel pressured, they feel threatened ... you also have religious leaders going to mayors asking to have separate hours in public swimming pools between men and women. You'll have a lot of young girls who don't want to sit in biology classes in school because they feel pressure from their parents or from their brothers,"" Haddad said.

""That makes it very complicated for young women and other groups such as LGBTs to express themselves,"" he added.

In this week's Arena, we discuss secularism in France and its impact on religious freedom.

In the world of US President Donald Trump, it has come to mean the civil servants who have been working for the government for years.

They are ""holdovers"" from previous administrations, and they are blocking his agenda and policy reversals. At least, that's the mantra that he repeats in his campaign rallies nationwide.

But is Trump using this construct as a punching bag to paint himself as an underdog who is fighting the powers that be?

""Deep state"" has become a permanent fixture of the culture wars in the United States, and Trump is using it to energise his base.

So what is the reality of the ""deep state"" in US politics? Join Steve Clemons as he hosts a discussion on the ramifications of the constant presidential rants against government bureaucrats and diplomats.

47,_aSLhz00U7s,Al Jazeera English,Japan: The Age Of Social Withdrawal | 101 East,2020-03-20T06:21:54Z,25,"Kenji Yamase spends his days in his bedroom.

The 54-year-old has been a ""hikikomori"" all of his adult life. The term describes Japanese who rarely interact with society beyond their family.

""It's a sense or feeling that you shouldn't be here. Even if you are here, you feel like you aren't yourself,"" Kenji says.

Japan is home to more than one million hikikomori, according to recent government surveys. Many of them are over the age of 40 and rely heavily on their elderly parents.

Kenji lives with his 88-year-old mother. ""Year by year, I can feel that she's deteriorating ... I worry about her, but I don't know what to do, so I feel very bad,"" he says. ""I feel sad thinking about when she's gone.""

An increasing number of school students are also choosing to shun the outside world. Known as ""futoko"", these children blame a rigid education system, bullying and strict parenting for their social withdrawal. It has led to NGOs setting up education centres across the country as an alternative to Japan's strict schools.

Umi Maekita, who runs Nemonet Free School, says most children who attend these centres eventually return to the mainstream education system. He says early intervention can prevent a lifetime of isolation.

""Telling them to go back to work or go back to school straight away is not the way,"" he says.

101 East meets the young and old who feel lost in Japan.

48,lZs8gRg0AEE,Al Jazeera English,Jho Low: Hunt for a Fugitive (Part 2) | Featured Documentary,2020-11-16T21:00:14Z,25,"He has been called one of the most wanted men on the planet, the shadowy mastermind of the now infamous $4.5bn 1MDB fraud that robbed Malaysia of its sovereign wealth - and brought down a prime minister.

But Low Taek Jho, or Jho Low, as he is known, has so far managed to elude Malaysian and international law enforcement agencies - somehow staying out of the public eye and keeping one step ahead of Interpol red notices for his arrest.

Yet, as this exclusive Al Jazeera investigation reveals, even while on the run, Jho Low has been attempting to negotiate yet another behind-the-scenes deal - this time to stay out of jail.

With new information on the role played by Jho Low and his associates in the 1MDB scandal, and previously unheard recordings of the man himself, this eye-opening film sheds new light on what has been dubbed ""the world's biggest heist"".
