2,aFGHerqhSC8,euronews,This baptism in Georgia is enough to make your head spin,2017-01-19T17:47:48Z,25,"New parents in Tbilisi,  Georgia queued up to have their children blessed at the Trinity Cathedral in celebration of the Epiphany on January 19.

""This baptism in Georgia is enough to make your head spin""

The mass baptism was an invention of Patriarch of all Georgia Ilia II, seen to be one of the most influential men in the country.

He came up with the idea to stimulate the country's low birth rate, promising to personally baptise every third child in each family.

The patriarch blessed 780 children during the day.

The leaders were taking in a presentation of a new Volkswagen model when the four women started chanting ""f... dictator"". The activists had the same words painted in black ink across their chests and were eventually overpowered by security guards.

Merkel and Putin were attending the Hanover Messe in northern Germany, where Russia is this year's guest country. Photos taken afterwards suggest they saw the funny side of the protest, if not the motivation behind it.

At the event's inauguration on Sunday evening, Merkel urged Putin to ""give a chance"" to non-governmental organisations, describing them as a ""motor of innovation"" while, outside, demonstrators protested a recent Russian crackdown on NGOs that has included raids on their offices.



FEMEN is a protest group started in Ukraine in 2008, whose membership has grown to countries across the world.  According to ==its website==, its purpose is ""sextremism serving to protect women's rights, democracy watchdogs attacking patriarchy, in all its forms: the dictatorship, the church, the sex industry.""

Last Thursday topless FEMEN activists ""staged rallies in front of mosques and Tunisian embassies across Europe"":http://www.euronews.com/2013/04/04/femen-targets-islam-in-bare-breast-brussels-protest/ against what they called an Islamist attack on Arab women's rights.

9,pA_YVsQFtaU,euronews,Teen prostitution in Ukraine,2013-05-31T19:58:59Z,25,"Ukraine June 1 marks Children's Day. However, an alarming number of teenage girls, many escaping problems at home, have turned to prostitution. Around 11-15 thousand according to UNICEF. 

The country is also suffering from one of the worst AIDS epidemics in Europe. Teen prostitutes are extremely vulnerable to HIV due to lack of knowledge or access to methods of prevention.

In the Mykolaiv region of Southern Ukraine, the death rate from HIV infection in the 15-24 age group is one of the highest in the country. 

Seventeen-year-old Nataliya explains how she first got involved in sex work.

""My friend has been doing it for 7 years, she told me I could do it too. At first I didn't want to. Now I have enough money. I can help my mom. She doesn't know what I do, not even my friends know,"" she confides.

Nataliya hopes to go on to study medicine, but Yuliya has no plans to quit.

""There aren't so many opportunities to make money in our city. What I do really helps me and I'm OK with it. I also like the fact that now I have someone to ask for advice, to talk to and even listen to that advice in certain situations. But one of the most important things is that I can check my health regularly and talk to a psychologist,"" she notes.

In Mykolaiv, the UNITUS charity works alongside UNICEF to provide healthcare, social services and psychological help to young people at risk of contracting HIV/AIDS.

Out of 350 female clients, most have been tested. Up to 10 per cent have the virus.

""One of the biggest problems is an extremely low level of knowledge and understanding of how HIV is transmitted. And even if people know it, they still do not regard this risk important,"" says Olena Sakovych from UNICEF.

This mobile HIV testing unit can find women most at risk on the streets and provide them with advice and access to a psychologist. 

Studies show that use of mobile units can reduce the numbers infected.

A nurse carrying out an HIV test tells the teenage prostitute:

""When accidents happen and the condom breaks, you have to get a check-up.""

 At 1.24 am, an engineer recorded in his diary that the protective system was not working. At the same moment, a huge and catastrophic surge in power caused two explosions. 

As fires raged, the core of reactor number four was destroyed. A huge cloud rose into the sky, spreading large amounts of radioactive fuel and materials into the atmosphere.

http://www.euronews.com/2013/12/01/fans-in-shock-at-death-of-fast-and-furious-star-paul-walker
Actor Paul Walker has died in a car crash in Southern California. His death has left his fan base across the world in shock.  

The star of the 'Fast and Furious' movies was a passenger in the red Porsche which burst into flames when it crashed. He and the driver were pronounced dead at the scene.

Tributes have poured in to the 40- year-old who had been attending a charity event for his organisation ""Reach Out Worldwide.""

""Everybody was saying he had died and I thought it was a hoax and because of the way he died and being in the 'Fast and Furious films' I thought 'no way'. He was one of the celebrities using his fame for good reason,"" said one fan. 

At the scene and across the world he will be remembered as a star and for the work of ""Reach Out Worldwide"" which helped victims of natural disasters around the globe.

Walker, who began his acting career a child in commercials, starred in all but one of the six multi-million dollar ""Fast and Furious"" hit movies in which he played Brian O'Connor, a law enforcement agent.

http://www.euronews.com/2013/12/04/regulate-or-root-out-prostitution-the-oldest-profession-in-the-world
It is often called the oldest profession in the world - prostitution. Should it be banned or regulated like other businesses?  In Europe there are a few countries where it is forbidden, such as Finland and Romania but without penalising those who use the services of a prostitute.

For it is the clients and not the prostitutes who are the core of the business.

""You have to cut off evil at the root. Prostitution flourishes and is maintained by customers and the only way to hit the business is with a change of outlook and that is to punish the root of it, the client,"" opined Rosen Richer, a former prostitute

There are five countries in Europe which impose punishments. Sweden, Norway, Iceland, the United Kingdom but only if the person is forced into prostitution - human trafficking is an example of that. Slovakia has penalties of up to ten years in prison. 

Since 1999 Sweden has been at the forefront of curbing prostitution, punishing paying for sex with imprisonment of at least six months and with fines imposed in proportion to the person's income.

It has proved an effective weapon, say the police, in the fight against human trafficking.

""Things have definitely changed because all the customers that come here know that there's the risk that there are some police officers sitting somewhere,"" said Per Hjort who is a police inspector in Sweden. 

The result is that almost 5,000 men have often just been detained for questioning and not imprisoned. The fear is the law has driven customers to go online where sex is on offer.

In contrast, five countries have regulated prostitution. Denmark since 1999 while the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and Greece also regulate it.

In Switzerland prostitution is considered a fully fledged economic activity and permitted from the age of 16.

In Zurich a drive-in-for-sex has just opened in a bid to better-regulate the business. It is run by the city authorities.

""In the last few years the problem has increased and in particular when we saw Romanians being forced into it. The situation deteriorated and so we had to find a solution,"" said Michael Hertzig of the Social Services Department.

We assembled a panel of experts to debate this and give us their ideas on the future of their industries.

The technology sector is facing sharper scrutiny after a former Facebook employee turned whistleblower accused the company of knowingly choosing profits over public safety, providing thousands of internal documents to support the claims.

As calls for more regulation intensify, citizens, policy-makers and innovators are wondering: how can we ensure technology serves the public good without stifling innovation? Can innovation be both profitable and take into account the public good?

Euronews assembled a panel of experts to address these questions during a live debate and to give their thoughts on how innovation can benefit everyone.

46,OJdZY3gvgAI,euronews,The Netherlands has a new King,2013-04-30T16:27:07Z,25,"http://www.euronews.com/ The new Dutch King Willem-Alexander has been sworn in at a ceremony in Amsterdam's Nieuwe Kerk.

Willem Alexander becomes the first king of the Netherlands in more than 120 years, ascending a throne largely stripped of political power but still invested with huge symbolic significance.

With his wife Queen Maxima by his side, the King took the oath of allegiance. Outside the church, a massive crowd had gathered to follow the ceremony on giant screens.  

Like her mother and grandmother before her, Beatrix, who is 75, chose to abdicate after a 33-year reign, saying her son was ready and that it was time for the throne to be held by ""a new generation"".

Beatrix is a very popular Queen with an estimated 8 out of 10 Dutch people in favour of maintaining the monarchy. 

The abdication takes place on Queen's Day, a national holiday in The Netherlands, giving the Dutch an opportunity to gather and celebrate in what are rather morose economic times with the country back in recession. 

After her abdication, Queen Beatrix, the new King Willem-Alexander and his wife, Queen Maxima, appeared on the balcony of the Royal Palace in Amsterdam to an enthusiastic orange-clad crowd of well-wishers.

Nearly a million people are estimated to have converged on Amsterdam for the event, including more than 10,000 police officers deployed in a massive security operation. 

The new King and Queen were joined by their three daughters, the eldest of whom, nine-year-old Catharina-Amalia, becomes Princess of Orange and heir to the throne.
