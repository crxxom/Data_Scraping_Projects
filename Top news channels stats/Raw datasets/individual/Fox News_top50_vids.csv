And what I'm hearing from my people in that district are the three G's, gas, groceries and grandkids. So people are having difficulty filling up their gas tank and a grocery cart on the same day. And they're worried about the future of our children because Nancy Pelosi's radical spending. We're spending our grand children's money, and it's simply inappropriate. We need to focus on home right now. We're in Dutch and when we flip the house, we're going to make sure that we stop this madness and bring America back to where it should be, and that's a place of greatness in the world.

...

JOE CONCHA: Let’s just remove all the noise. Democrats need 50 votes in the Senate to pass this bill. Kamala Harris serves as the tiebreaker, they have 48. The math also extends to inflation. You’ve talked about it before. The CBO says Build Back Better will add, what $3 trillion to the deficit?

So maybe just maybe those covering the story might want to explore that angle a little bit more in its coverage. Finally, more hard numbers and I’ll leave it here: Joe Biden is currently polling at 65% disapproval in West Virginia. That’s the state Manchin represents. Three quarters of people living in that state oppose the Build Back Better bill. Add it all up and Manchin is simply using common sense here.
