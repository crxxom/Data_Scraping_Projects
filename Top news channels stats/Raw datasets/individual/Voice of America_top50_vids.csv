0,EQRZoxnnfbA,Voice of America,Coronavirus: El Salvador Declares State of Emergency in Prisons,2020-04-26T16:53:22Z,25,"Footage provided by El Salvador's Presidency show inmates at the Izalco prison lining up in tight lines during a security operation during the coronavirus pandemic, northwest of San Salvador, Saturday, April 25. 

Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele late on Friday ordered a 24-hour lockdown of prisons containing gang members, and said their leaders would be sent into solitary confinement after a sudden spike in homicides during the day.

Bukele said the ‚Äúmaximum emergency‚Äù lockdown would be enforced while police investigated some 22 homicides reported on Friday. 

Only a few years ago, El Salvador, which has long been plagued by powerful street gangs known as maras, had the highest homicide rate in the Americas.

El Salvador has imposed some of the strictest measures in the Americas to combat the spread of the coronavirus.

Riots have broken out at prisons all over the world including in Argentina, Cameroon, and Malawi as the global health crisis exaggerates.

Inmates are protesting hygiene conditions, lack of personal protection equipment and poor cell conditions, while some protested on the roof of prisons.

Looking like a superhero, Franky Zapata successfully completed the famed 35-kilometer (22-mile) journey in just 22 minutes Sunday morning, reaching speeds of up to 177 kilometers per hour (110 mph) on the flyboard that has made him a French household name.
 
Propelled by a power pack full of kerosene, Zapata set off from Sangatte in France's Pas de Calais region and landed in St. Margaret's Bay, beyond the white cliffs of Dover, in southeast England. He stopped only once, on the British side, to refuel his futuristic invention from a boat in the choppy waters.

But U.S. officials vow to help Ukraine defend itself, as VOA‚Äôs Senior Diplomatic Correspondent Cindy Saine reports.

As Russia‚Äôs assault on Ukraine continues in the city of Kharkiv, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed Ukraine Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal to the State Department Friday. Blinken again expressed confidence that Ukraine will prevail in the war.

Antony Blinken, Secretary of State:

""I think this is the first visit since the Russian aggression by a senior official of the Ukrainian government, further evidence that an independent, sovereign Ukraine is going to be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin.‚Äù

Both Prime Minister Shmyhal and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the U.S. and other Western partners for ‚Äúfinally‚Äù providing the weapons Ukraine needs to fight back against Russia‚Äôs offensive in Donbas and southern Ukraine.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukrainian President:

‚ÄúAnd I am grateful to all our partners who finally heard us, who are providing us with exactly what we asked for. Because we know for sure that with these weapons, we will be able to save the lives of thousands of people.""

At the Pentagon, press secretary John Kirby was asked whether Ukraine's forces, now that they're getting heavy weapons, would be able to beat back the invading Russians.

John Kirby, Pentagon Press Secretary

‚ÄúI think that's a question that only the Ukrainian armed forces can answer, not the United States military. What I can tell you is that we, in keeping with another 30 plus nations, are doing everything we can to give them the tools that they need to defend themselves and to push the Russians out. ‚Äú

Some observers say the U.S. assessment of Ukraine‚Äôs ability to win has shifted over the past couple of weeks.

Anne Applebaum, Historian:

""Until the last week or so, I think Americans still weren't wholly convinced that Ukraine could win. And there were some doubts about whether, you know, these heavy weapons were necessary and so on. As I said, it feels to me like there's been a shift in the last week, and the decisions to give much more serious weapons have now been made.‚Äù

Ahead of Orthodox Easter this Sunday, European Council President Charles Michel said he strongly appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin during a phone call Friday to allow humanitarian access to the besieged city of Mariupol, where civilians remain trapped.

READ MORE: Spain's prime minister flew to the country's North African enclave Tuesday to contain a migration crisis with neighboring Morocco after 6,000 migrants swam or walked over the border.   

Videos emerged that appeared to show Moroccan soldiers opening security gates to let migrants through to the Spanish port city.   

‚ÄúThis sudden arrival of irregular migrants is a serious crisis for Spain and Europe,‚Äù said Pedro Sanchez in a televised address to the nation before travelling to Ceuta and Melilla, another Spanish enclave bordering Morocco.   

Experts suggested this huge influx, which included entire families, was an attempt by Morocco to pressure Spain to alter its policy toward Western Sahara, the disputed territory to which Rabat lays claim.  

Morocco and Spain have been mired in a diplomatic dispute over the presence in Spain of a Polisario Front leader, whose movement has fought for the independence of Western Sahara.
