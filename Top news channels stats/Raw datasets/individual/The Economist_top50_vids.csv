Every night almost everyone on the planet enters into a state of unconsciousness and paralysis - but what is really happening inside the body when we drift off, and what's the impact if we don't get enough sleep?

Sleep is regulated by your circadian rhythm, or body clock located in the brain. The body clock responds to light hews ramping up production of the hormone melatonin at night, and switching it off when it senses light. 

There are four stages of sleep that the body experiences in cycles throughout the night. On a good night we cycle through these stages four or five times. 

Stages one and two are light sleep. This is a transition from being awake to falling asleep. Heart rate and breathing begin to slow, body temperature falls, and muscles may twitch. Stage 3 is sometimes referred to as Delta sleep - because of the slow Delta brainwaves that are released during this stage. This is the first stage of deep sleep where our cells produce the most growth hormone to service bones and muscles, allowing the body to repair itself. Stage 4 is where we begin to dream. The body creates chemicals that render it temporarily paralyzed so that we do not act out our dreams. In this stage, the brain is extremely active and our eyes, although closed, dark back and forth as if we were awake.

Humans roughly spend one third of their lives asleep. Modern lifestyles, stress and the proliferation of Technology, mean that people is sleeping far less today than they were a century ago. 

Sleeping less than seven hours per day is associated with an increased risk of developing chronic conditions which could reduce life expectancy.

So for a healthier longer life get some shut-eye

1,p0G68ORc8uQ,The Economist,The deep ocean is the final frontier on planet Earth,2017-03-23T12:03:53Z,28,"Watch the latest in the Ocean series - How to stop plastics getting into the ocean: https://youtu.be/D7EdgCxFZ8Q

The ocean covers 70% of our planet. The deep-sea floor is a realm that is largely unexplored, but cutting-edge technology is enabling a new generation of aquanauts to go deeper than ever before.

Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.trib.al/rWl91R7 

Beneath the waves is a mysterious world that takes up to 95% of Earth's living space. Only three people have ever reached the bottom of the deepest part of the ocean. The deep is a world without sunlight, of freezing temperatures, and immense pressure. It's remained largely unexplored until now.

Cutting-edge technology is enabling a new generation of aquanauts to explore deeper than ever before. They are opening up a whole new world of potential benefits to humanity. The risks are great, but the rewards could be greater. From a vast wealth of resources to clues about the origins of life, the race is on to the final frontier 

The Okeanos Explorer, the American government state-of-the-art vessel, designed for every type of deep ocean exploration from discovering new species to investigating shipwrecks. On board, engineers and scientists come together to answer questions about the origins of life and human history. 

Today the Okeanos is on a mission to investigate the wreck of a World War one submarine. Engineer Bobby Moore is part of a team who has developed the technology for this type of mission.  

The “deep discover”, a remote operating vehicle is equipped with 20 powerful LED lights and designed to withstand the huge pressure four miles down. Equivalent to 50 jumbo jets stacked on top of a person

While the crew of the Okeanos send robots to investigate the deep, some of their fellow scientists prefer a more hands-on approach. Doctor Greg stone is a world leading marine biologist with over 8,000 hours under the sea. He has been exploring the abyss in person for 30 years. 

The technology opening up the deep is also opening up opportunity. Not just to witness the diversity of life but to glimpse vast amounts of rare mineral resources. Some of the world's most valuable metals can be found deep under the waves. A discovery that has begun to pique the interest of the global mining industry.

The boldest of mining companies are heading to the deep drawn by the allure of a new Gold Rush. But to exploit it they're also beating a path to another strange new world. In an industrial estate in the north of England, SMD is one of the world's leading manufacturers of remote underwater equipment. The industrial technology the company has developed has made mining possible several kilometers beneath the ocean surface.  

With an estimated 150 trillion dollars’ worth of gold alone, deep-sea mining has the potential to transform the global economy. 

With so much still to discover, mining in the deep ocean could have unknowable impact. It's not just life today that may need protecting; reaching the deep ocean might just allow researchers to answer some truly fundamental questions. Hydrothermal vents, hot springs on the ocean floor, are cracks in the Earth's crust. Some claim they could help scientists glimpse the origins of life itself. 

We might still be years away from unlocking the mysteries of the deep. Even with the latest technology, this kind of exploration is always challenging.  As the crew of the Okeanos comes to terms with a scale of the challenge and the opportunity that lies beneath, what they and others discover could transform humanity's understanding of how to protect the ocean.

It's the most hostile environment on earth, but the keys to our future may lie in the deep.

Read more about Chickenomics here: https://econ.st/2Wtp04o
Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy 

Chickens are the most populous bird on the planet. There are 23 billion of them at any given time - that's ten times more than any other bird.  It's by far the fastest growing meat product but pound for pound the price of chicken has fallen sharply. How has this happened? 

This farm is at the forefront of a technology revolution that has drastically changed chicken farming. It's run by David Speller who's pioneered the use of CCTV and CO2 monitors in chicken sheds. Along with his own farm, he works as a consultant overseeing the raising of around 3 million chickens in the UK. 

Chickens were first domesticated over 8,000 years ago but it wasn't until the 1940s that major efforts were made to create a super breed. The chicken of tomorrow competition in America would change chickens forever.

Today the lifecycle of broilers, chickens that are bred purely for their meat, is entirely preordained. They grow faster and bigger than ever before and they can only live supported by human technology. Chickens have changed so quickly they are now four times the size they were in the 1950s. 

A barnyard chicken can live up to 10 years showing the huge evolutionary change the broilers have undergone. But selective breeding on a global scale comes at a cost. If the chickens live beyond their planned life they develop huge medical problems. And there are concerns the chicken industry is relying on an increasingly small gene pool. 

Keeping chickens in battery cages was banned in the EU in 2012 but some people want to create better lives for broiler chickens. Free-range birds have more access to open air runs, while organic chickens are typically free from antibiotics, hormones and other synthetic chemicals. Organic chickens get to live the longest - 81 days compared to intensively reared birds which live between 35 and 40 days. Free-range chickens get the most access to open air runs but when it comes to living space, organic and free-range fair far better than intensively reared birds where as many as 17 adult birds live in a single square metre.

Organic farming might offer animals a greater quality of life but consumers are largely driven by cost and in an average UK supermarket, an intensively reared chicken cost several times less than its free-range or organic cousins.

Over 95% of broiler chickens are intensively reared in the UK. Organic and free-range chickens make up the rest. For as long as shoppers want cheap and plentiful chicken, they will continue to  be bred ever more intensively.

5,OKKbkS_LOu4,The Economist,Why does time pass?,2015-09-03T19:30:01Z,28,"The equations of physics suggest time should be able to go backwards as well as forwards. Experience suggests, though, that it cannot. Why? And is time travel really possible?

Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.trib.al/rWl91R7 

Why does time pass? It is a question so profound that few people would even think to ask it. Yet its effects are all around. Human beings live in a perpetual present, inexorably sealed off from the past, but moving relentlessly into the future. For most people, time seems to be something that is just out there. A thing ticking away in the background - fixed, immutable. Time seems to go in one direction and in one direction only. But physicists see it much differently.

One of the great minds who changed the way science thinks about time was Albert Einstein. In 1905 he published his special theory of relativity. In it he demonstrated that time passes differently in different places depending on how those places are moving with respect to one another.

Einstein showed that the faster one travels the slower time goes for the traveler. At the speeds at which humans move this is imperceptible. But for someone traveling on a spaceship at speeds close to that of light, time would slow down compared with its passage for people on earth.

There was another important aspect of Einstein's theory which he didn't even realize when he published it. That time was woven into the very fabric of space itself. Einstein used this insight to help develop his general theory of relativity which incorporated gravity. He published it in 1915. 

With the general theory of relativity he demonstrated that massive objects warped the fabric of space-time. It is this curvature that causes time to slow down near them. Time slows down in proportion to the gravitational pull of a nearby object so the effect would be strong near a black hole but milder near the earth. But even here it can be detected. Einstein's theories had to be taken into account when the GPS system was set up otherwise it would have been inaccurate. 

One scientist who puzzled over the directionality of time was Arthur Eddington, a 20th century astronomer who defined the concept of the arrow of time, based on observations made by the 19th century physicist Ludwig Boltzmann. The arrow of time is based on the second law of thermodynamics which says the disorder known as entropy increases with time. For example, a building left untouched will slowly decay into its surroundings. It will disintegrate into a more chaotic state but it is highly unlikely that the building will become more orderly over time - this is because there are many more ways for a system to be disorderly than orderly. There can be many ways for something to break for instance but only one way for it to be put back together again. A system will be less disordered in the past and more disordered in the future. This is the arrow of time. 

So how can the arrow of time be reconciled with Einstein's equations? If time can go forwards and backwards according to relativity does that mean it's possible to go backwards in time? The theory of relativity does allow time travel to the future.

Einstein's theories do allow for the formation of wormholes in space. These are shortcuts that link otherwise distant places in the space-time continuum. 

Although wormholes are theoretically possible they're a highly implausible proposition. That's because the equations suggest enormous masses and energies would be required to create and manipulate one. 

What remains then is a mystery. Theory fails to forbid traveling backwards in time but practice suggests it might just as well be forbidden. For now it would appear the arrow of time cannot be reversed. No one knows why time passes but it seems that no matter how people look at it, it goes in one direction in one direction only.

What will be the seismic shifts in the year ahead? The appearance of this outfit convulsed world politics for several years; struck fear into the hearts of people all around the world. Islamic State is the most vicious and murderous jihardist regime the world has ever seen. 

In 2017, it will be smashed. The defeat of Islamic State will be one of the most significant things to happen in 2017. Forces from some 60 countries have taken the fight to Islamic State. It now clings to two key strongholds, one in Iraq and one in Syria.

Controlling territory is what defines Islamic State. Recruits have been drawn from all over the world to fight for its declared domain.

In October 2016, an Iraqi-led force launched a concerted effort to reclaim Mosul. The city is set to fall within months with the Syrian stronghold of Raqqa and a few remaining pockets likely to follow shortly after. But many of the fighters themselves may outlast Islamic State.

For the west too it may prove a pyrrhic victory

19,1ylleTbizgU,The Economist,Is America right to fear Huawei?,2019-11-12T18:01:19Z,25,"America worries that Huawei, China's telecoms giant, spies on behalf of its government and threatens Western interests. Such concerns are not just about America's security, but also its insecurity. Read more here: https://econ.st/2O9kgyc

Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy 

Rarely does a country go to war with a private company. But America has done just that. But is this really about Huawei or is it something bigger than that? And what is the threat? 

What is this war really about and why is Huawei in the middle of it?

Founded in China in 1987 Huawei is now the world’s largest maker of telecoms equipment with revenues exceeding $103bn. When you think about Huawei you might think about the handset. That makes sense, since it sold 200m of them in 2018 alone. But close to half of its revenue comes from selling network equipment. In fact, since 2014 it’s outgrown all its competitors reaching over 3bn people.

This is how networks function - Your phone sends a signal to a nearby tower using radio waves, voice and data are passed over an internal network run by your phone company, which connects your handset to other phone users and the wider internet. In other words, these antennas connect us all. But now, there’s a new kind of network. Although 5G is massively overhyped, it is coming and Huawei is a leading force in this innovation. But though this computerised, smart future opens up new possibilities it comes with a health warning. Because if entire networks are vulnerable this opens the door to countries spying on one another.

In a rare interview with The Economist Ren Zhengfei, Huawei’s founder and CEO, talked about the political storm surrounding his company. As the argument rages over the security of Huawei’s products the effects can be seen in some unexpected places. Joe Franell runs Eastern Oregon Telecom, a small network serving the people of this rural area. The problem is that the network here relies on Huawei technology.

It’s a similar story around the world Mobile-phone users in developing countries have benefited from Huawei’s attractive deals. But how is Huawei undercutting its competitors?

Whether or how Huawei is connected to and subsidised by the Chinese government is unclear. But what is clear is this - China is the kind of country where if the party says jump all you can say is, well how high? Loyalty to the state is actually enshrined in China’s intelligence law
Article 7, a 2017 addition, states that “Any organisation or citizen shall support, assist and co-operate with the state intelligence work.” Critics say this law means that when you buy Huawei equipment you may be exposing yourself to surveillance by the Chinese intelligence services. And this makes governments very uncomfortable.

The fear is that Huawei will leave backdoor vulnerabilities in its networks that would provide China with an opportunity to spy on its competitors and enemies. To counter this mistrust, Huawei has shared its code and allowed the likes of Britain’s National Cyber Security Centre
to scan it for backdoors. So, if there’s no solid security threat why is America making an enemy out of Huawei?

It seems as though the concern over Huawei is not only about America’s security but also its insecurity. And it’s causing collateral damage at home as well as abroad. In May 2019 the Trump administration issued an executive order which not only forbade American companies from supplying Huawei with components, but restricted domestic networks from using its equipment. It’s a move that feels like an own goal to Americans like Joe Franell.

And there’s another uncomfortable truth that America can’t ignore. Smartphone technology relies on a truly global supply chain. Take an average smartphone. Some contain components from more than 200 international suppliers. Screens might be made by Samsung in South Korea. The camera lens engineered in Germany. The chip could be designed by a California-based company and manufactured in Taiwan. The battery could come from Japan and the audio chip from China. But increasingly, hostility and lack of trust threaten to fracture these supply chains.

America's concerns about Huawei are understandable. But the risks can be managed by limiting the use of Huawei equipment to less sensitive parts of 5G networks. That way it is possible to benefit from the low cost of Huawei’s equipment while minimising security concerns.

Billions of people around the world have benefited from increased connectivity made possible by global standards and global supply chains. But if political mistrust divides the telecoms industry into rival camps
everybody stands to lose

20,oguPMXcrOVY,The Economist,Why is vanilla so expensive?,2019-05-15T17:09:07Z,25,"In recent years, natural vanilla has sometimes been more expensive than silver by weight. Vanilla farmers in Madagascar are cashing in—but violence, theft and volatile markets are threatening their prospects.

Read more here: https://econ.st/2W5qwNB
Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy 

From ice cream to cakes and even perfume, vanilla is the go-to flavour the world over. In recent years the price of natural vanilla has shot up. At one point it was more expensive than silver by weight.

80% of the world’s vanilla is grown in the perfectly suited climate of the north-east region of Madagascar. It’s the country’s primary export crop. For the farmers, like Beni Odon, life is far sweeter when the vanilla price is high. 

In 2014 vanilla was $80 a kilo. Three years later it was $600. Today it’s around $500. The price rise is due in part to global demand. The trend of eating naturally means that food companies have shunned synthetic flavouring in favour of the real deal. Beni and the other farmers are cashing in.

But things can change very quickly. Price fluctuations affect producers of agricultural commodities everywhere but vanilla is particularly volatile. In just a few weeks the price can jump, or plummet, by over 20%

Liberalisation is one reason for such movements. The Malagasy government once regulated the vanilla industry and its price. But now the price is negotiated at the point of sale which makes for a freer market but a more volatile one. It’s also a tiny industry. A single cyclone can knock out the entire crop within Madagascar. It’s also a difficult and delicate crop to grow.

The growers have to contend with another problem. Thieves are targeting the vanilla crops. Some farmers have resorted to harvesting the beans before they’re ripe but this produces a poorer quality vanilla and ultimately pushes down the price.

The combination of deteriorating quality and high prices is having an effect. The vanilla price bubble may burst. Big buyers that provide vanilla for the likes of Häagen-Dazs and Ben & Jerry’s are now working directly with farmers in a bid to gain greater control over quality. Other companies have started to look elsewhere for their natural vanilla. Indonesia, Uganda and even the Netherlands are growing the crop. For a century Madagascar has enjoyed a near-monopoly on vanilla. But this industry may be in line for a radical overhaul.

28,SWWkUzkfJ4M,The Economist,24 & ready to die,2015-11-10T10:44:38Z,25,"Emily is 24 years old and physically healthy. But she wants her doctors to end her life. 

Subscribe NOW to The Economist: http://econ.st/1Fsu2Vj

24 & ready to die is the tragic case of Emily, a young Belgian woman granted the right to a doctor’s help to end her own life because of her persistent, severe depression.

Belgium and the Netherlands are the only countries which permit doctor-assisted dying for those experiencing unbearable mental suffering. 

Several American states allow doctor-assisted dying for the terminally ill, including, from next year, California.

Majorities in 13 of the 15 countries polled by The Economist and IPSOS MORI in June support doctor-assisted dying.

The Economist has championed doctor-assisted dying in articles and editorials since the 1990s, including most recently a cover story in June this year. The Economist ran a video advert in London in September and Berlin asking: “Could you live a life like this?” to encourage people to start talking about the right to die.

Support for doctor-assisted dying is growing globally. Bills have recently been debated in Britain and Germany, and a ruling in Canada’s Supreme Court means that country will soon have legal doctor-assisted dying too. California’s governor signed an assisted-dying bill into law in October.

A recent poll by Ipsos-MORI for The Economist found majorities in support of doctor-assisted dying laws in 13 out of 15 countries surveyed—including the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada and Germany. But only in Belgium and the Netherlands were majorities in favour of allowing doctor-assisted dying in cases of unbearable suffering that is mental, rather than physical.

The Economist supports the introduction of legalised doctor-assisted dying around the world. Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor-in-chief of The Economist, says: “For The Economist, the case for allowing doctor-assisted dying relies on personal choice and individual autonomy. Our liberal values and respect for human dignity mean that for this paper, doctor-assisted dying is a cause worth championing.”

The world’s leading superpowers are locking horns. Over the past 16 months America and China have been trading blows through tariffs on goods. The impact is being felt on industries worldwide. But what is the story behind the America-China trade war?

So the trade war, what have you guys been looking at? The US doesn’t like that China is growing so fast and set to overtake America as the biggest economy in the world if it hasn’t already by certain measures. Basically China and the US are caught in this race of imposing tariffs on each other so the US slaps a high tariff on certain products then China retaliates.

It’s multiple industries across multiple markets, it’s huge. And I think right now would be a really good time to look at what’s happened how it could impact the world from now on. 

At The Economist, we’ve been covering the trade war extensively Soumaya Keynes is our trade and globalisation editor based in Washington, DC.

How did this whole trade war kick off? How did this whole trade war start? For a long time there have been frustrations that past American administrations had with the Chinese. On the 2016 presidential campaign trail you started to see some really tough rhetoric.

China’s economic rise has been dramatic. In 1978 China’s GDP at market prices was just 6% of America’s. Last year it had grown to 66%. When considering local spending power China has already overtaken America. This unprecedented growth began with President Deng Xiaoping. He started opening up China’s economy to the world in 1978 and the country quickly became “the world’s factory”. Over the next decade, exports as a share of GDP tripled and by 1988 15% of China’s exports went to America. The World Trade Organisation opened its doors to China in 2001. And it was America that ushered it in. 

After joining the WTO, China became an economic superpower. But people had expected the country to also become more like a Western capitalist economy. That didn’t happen. America now claims that China achieved its growth by not playing fair. Are those claims justified?

The Trump administration has been using tariffs or taxes on imported goods to try to force the Chinese to change their ways. In July 2018 America imposed tariffs of 25% on $34bn worth of Chinese products. That almost doubled the average tariff rate on Chinese imports from 3.8% to 6.7%. And it’s American firms that have to pay that tax. But with every increase from America, came an increase from China. Since the start of the trade war China has more than doubled its average tariff rate. America’s has tripled. The fight has become overtly political because China’s tariffs are hitting President Trump’s voter base. Many counties where Trump won in the 2016 election were here in the Great Plains and these are the counties most affected by China’s tariffs. 

As things stand now, a ceasefire in the trade war could be drawing near. The two leaders are hoping to agree on a “phase one” deal soon which could mean some tariffs being lifted The Trump administration wants China to buy more American produce and tighten up their intellectual property rules. If that phase one deal is signed will it be the beginning of the end of the trade war?

Even if there is a phase one deal there will be a lot of issues still to be resolved. But there’s more to the trade war than just tariffs. America has also imposed restrictions on some Chinese firms especially ones in the tech industry.

39,hSmAYUnZyxE,The Economist,How modern families increase social inequality,2019-11-18T16:35:20Z,25,"Modern families with two working adults are richer than those with a single breadwinner, and can afford to take a different approach to parenting. This is exacerbating inequality between rich and poor families.  Film supported by Mishcon de Reya

Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy 

The family has always been a central building block of society. But families have changed dramatically in the rich world over the past 50 years. Changes to society mean that the old model of a breadwinning husband and a stay-at-home wife has all but collapsed. And the different ways rich and poor families raise their children are increasing social inequality. Today, gay families like Maggie and Joelle’s are widely accepted in the rich world. A generation ago, it was almost unthinkable that same-sex couples would get married.But now most people in rich countries think gay marriage is fine. Fears that gay marriages would undermine heterosexual ones have proven unfounded. And this is one reason why marriage equality has spread so extraordinarily fast. Before 2001 gay marriage was not legal anywhere in the world. Since then, it’s been legalised in nearly all rich countries and developing nations are starting to follow suit. It’s a far cry from the 1960s, when families typically consisted of a dad who went to work a stay-at-home mum and three or more kids. Better access for women to contraception education and jobs has changed this traditional family portrait. Across the globe, families are shrinking. 
Nowhere more so than in South Korea. Here a growing number of women are rejecting marriage and having children altogether like Go Lee, who is 26. She says traditional employers make it hard to combine a career with marriage and motherhood. Go works in IT, but is also a vlogger on YouTube, where she urges South Korean women to be more assertive. She believes South Korean men are part of the problem

Many expect their wives to do all the housework and childcare, even if they have a job. There is a huge mismatch of expectations around marriage in South Korea. Most men want a 1950s-style relationship whereas women want something more modern and equal. The result is they often end up not marrying or having kids at all  and that’s left South Korea with a problem. Its population is in free fall. In 1960 the average South Korean woman had six children. In 2018 that figure shrank to less than one. A fertility rate of one means each generation is half as big as the previous one and in South Korea this means there are fewer workers to support the country’s ageing population. In rural areas, men are viewed as poor prospects by South Korean women. So the government is helping these men to find brides from poorer countries.


State-funded assimilation centres like this, teach immigrant brides how to cook Korean food how to speak Korean and even how to deal with Korean mothers-in-law. Like most of her classmates studying here today 19-year-old Nguyen Thi Cam Thuy is from Vietnam. She recently married a South Korean man 40-year-old Kim Dae Hyun who found her through a matchmaking website. Over a fifth of married South Korean farmers and fishermen have tied the knot with a foreigner. But cross-cultural unions can be difficult and around a fifth of marriages between South Korean men and foreign women end in divorce within four years. This video of a man beating his foreign wife caused widespread outrage. 50 years ago in most rich countries domestic violence was considered normal. Now, it is universally condemned and rates have fallen sharply by three-quarters in America alone, since the mid-1990s. 

Today, other factors are more likely to affect the stability of families and these are contributing to a growing gulf between middle-class and working-class families. In most rich countries, if you don’t go to university you are more likely to have kids outside of marriage. And women who don’t finish high school are more likely to end up as single mothers than women who have a degree. In Jamie’s hometown of Hartlepool in north-east England, 70% of babies are born outside marriage like her twins, Sean and Liam. In Hartlepool in the 1960s men did heavy work in shipyards and factories which was much better paid than any job their wives could find. So the women stayed at home with the kids. But as technology advances manual work has dried up and uneducated men have struggled to find good jobs. If the only men available lack steady jobs and don’t help around the home some women feel they are better off alone. Middle-class families have remained solid in rich countries over the past 50 years while working-class families have grown much less stable. Women with a university degree are more likely than women who do not finish high school to be married and raise children with their husband as a team.",1592026,28335,,3651,PT18M36S

He is currently being tried for embezzlement and money-laundering in France, where a verdict will be announced this week.

Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.trib.al/rWl91R7 

Meet one of Instagram's most famous playboys. He tours the world, driving fast cars and eating at the world's finest restaurants. He even gets hip-hop stars like Wyclef Jean to play at his lavish parties posting his exploits on his Instagram account. But this isn't your typical Instagram star.

He's the vice-president of a country, Equatorial Guinea. A small country in west Africa with a lot of oil.

Teodoro Nguema Obiang is the second-most-powerful man in the country. His father is the world's longest serving president, Teodoro Obiang Nguema. The Obiang family has amassed a fortune running into the hundreds of millions of dollars. But how have they made their money?

Equatorial Guinea has some of the most opaque national accounts in the world. Per head it is the richest country in Africa, yet people live in plastic-shack poverty. The most recent figures available from the World Bank suggest that three-quarters of the population live below the poverty line. But the presidential family seem oblivious to the poverty.

If the country is so wealthy, where is all the money going?

Tutu Alicante is a lawyer from Equatorial Guinea who is in exile in the United States. He runs an organisation that is trying to tackle corruption in his homeland. He knows first hand how the massive theft of public money has left little behind to fund public services.

While most of the population live in squalid conditions, Teddy splashes the cash, showing off his wealth on his Instagram account. Often using the hashtag luxury living he reveals a life of privilege and excess. Court papers say he amassed around $300m worldwide between 2000 and 2011, despite having an official government salary of less than $100,000 a year.

The Department of Justice alleged that Teddy embezzled millions of dollars from the public purse as cabinet minister. The Department of Justice agreed a settlement of around $30m with Teddy.

This year Teddy has found himself on trial again. This time in a separate case in France charged with embezzlement and money-laundering. After being unsuccessful in claiming diplomatic immunity he failed to show up to any of the court hearings. Instead, he posted videos on Instagram of himself on safari near Victoria Falls.

The French court valued his assets in France at around €100m, including a large property bought for €25m in Paris. The French public prosecutor has asked for a three-year jail sentence, €30m fine, and all of Teddy's assets in France to be seized. 

The vice-president denies the charges.

The future for Equatorial Guinea looks bleak. The president is ageing and his son is preparing to take over. The spendthrift strongmen of Equatorial Guinea are not the only presidential family in Africa who are under investigation for embezzling from the public purse. The presidents of Gabon and the Republic of Congo are also being investigated by judges in France.

But Teddy's had a busy time of late posting from the beaches of Brazil to the Great Wall of China. There are plenty of countries where regulators turn a blind eye to despots who want to hide their ill-gotten gains. But their secrets are increasingly being leaked and it helps if the autocrats themselves do the leaking, via Instagram.

What will be the biggest stories of the year ahead? 

00:35 - 10 - Powered Clothing
In 2019 power dressing will take on a whole new meaning when this strange-looking clothing hits the market. Not so much high fashion as high tech, it's a suit with built-in power that will literally get people moving. Part of the wearable robotics revolution, the suit is made up of battery-powered muscle packs which contract just like a human muscle to boost the wearer's strength. With the global population of over 60s expected to more than double by 2050, and retirement age increasing, there's no shortage of potential markets. But don't expect the suits to ease the burden on aching limbs and overstretched health services anytime soon - as these suits don't come cheap. According to the manufacturer they'll retail for around the cost of a bespoke tailored suit. 

02:13 - 9 - The year of cheap flights
2019 will be the year low-cost long-haul travel takes off. You'll be able to buy a ten thousand mile flight from London to Sydney for around $350 and this is why. The world will boast two new state-of-the-art mega hub airports and competition between them will drive down the cost of flying. Daxing Airport outside Beijing is due to open in 2019 and will feed growing demand for air travel in China. Beijing already has one of the world's biggest airports and for China this new mega hub will send an important message to the world. Rivaling Daxing as a national symbol of global prestige will be a new mega hub airport in Istanbul. Opened in 2018 it covers a staggering 26 square miles - an area larger than the island of Manhattan. And in 2019 consumers will again be the beneficiaries of a state sponsored economic push. But the low fares offered by competition between these hubs could be short-lived. 

04:06 - 8 Stonewall riots at 50
In 2019 LGBT communities will mark the anniversary of a seminal event - it will be 50 years since patrons at New York gay bar, The Stonewall Inn, resisted police attempts to arrest them. The resulting Stonewall riots kick-started the modern gay rights movement. In many countries the laws that continue to allow intolerance and inequality have their roots in religion. But one former British colony has given hope to the global movement for change. In 2018 India decriminalized homosexuality and gay rights campaigners hope 2019 will be the year other former British colonies follow suit. In February Kenya's High Court will rule on whether to decriminalize same-sex intimacy which is currently punishable with up to 14 years in prison. Campaigners hope that decriminalization could start a domino effect across Africa. 

06:28 - 7 Driverless Cars
With GM launching its driverless taxi service and Waymo expanding its Robotaxis to new cities 2019 will be the year the driverless car revolution hits the road. It was hit 1980s TV show Knight Rider that popularized self-driving cars controlled by artificial intelligence. Since then, billions of dollars of investment have fueled the drive to turn the idea into reality. Dubai has committed to a quarter of all trips being driverless by 2030 and the driverless car industry will be worth a predicted $550bn by 2026. But the advance of driverless cars could be held up by a red flag - as in March of 2018 the first person was killed by a self-driving car. But manufacturers are confident that the inevitable progress of technology will win over the skeptics.

08:49 - 6 Celebrating da Vinci
May 2019 will mark 500 years since the death of the greatest polymath in global history, Leonardo da Vinci. Leonardo painted the world's most expensive picture The Salvator Mundi which was auctioned for $450 million but he was also a brilliant scientist and engineer. In 2019 his art and notebooks will be taking center stage at blockbuster exhibitions. Leonardo sketched out designs for inventions that followed centuries later such as scuba equipment and the tank. And in 2019 another of his designs will be getting a new lease of life as a flying car becomes commercially available. The car flies thanks to folding helicopter blades which are derived from Leonardo's invention the aerial screw. Leonardo was the original outsider. Five centuries after his death there are still simple lessons he can teach today's divided world.

46,VfmR54giIJA,The Economist,Hong Kong protests: what's at stake for China?,2019-08-14T18:41:21Z,25,"The Hong Kong protests are the most serious challenge to China's authority since the Tiananmen Square massacre. Read more about the Hong Kong protests here: https://econ.st/2YKYdWV

Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy 
This protester calls himself “Bruce”. We’ve hidden his face and obscured his voice to protect his identity. He’s one of the millions of Hong Kongers taking to the streets. 

What started as a protest against an extradition bill has become the most serious challenge to the Communist Party’s authority since the Tiananmen Square protest three decades ago. As the demonstrations enter a third month neither the government nor the protesters is willing to back down.

But it’s not enough to deter the demonstrators. So what happens now?

Hong Kong is one of the most important financial centres in the world. And it has a unique status. It’s a city in China but it’s not entirely Chinese. It has its own currency, its own passport… its own legal system. There’s even a boundary between Hong Kong and the rest of China and you need a permit to cross it. This is all down to its history.

In 1842 Hong Kong was ceded by the Chinese to the British after the first Opium War. But in 1997 Britain gave it back to China. With one important condition - for 50 years Hong Kong was to be governed under what is known as “one country, two systems”. The chief executive who runs Hong Kong would be appointed by a pro-Chinese committee. But the city was guaranteed a high degree of autonomy with its own government, legal system and economic independence until 2047. Over the past decade those rights have been eroded.

Fuller democracy, promised as part of the handover agreement has yet to be granted by China. 

China’s grip has got ever tighter. In 2012 the government tried to install a patriotic pro-Chinese education system. Then five Hong Kong booksellers who sold material banned in mainland China disappeared. In 2016 pro-democracy opposition leaders were thrown out of Hong Kong’s parliament for insulting China when swearing their oaths. And then in February this year the government introduced a bill which would have allowed extradition to the mainland.

All this is fuelling the protesters’ anger.

As the protests get larger and more violent the chance of China intervening increases. Beijing has made thinly veiled threats to send in its military forces - the People’s Liberation Army.

In 1989 a student demonstration in Beijing ended in massacre. Hundreds, maybe thousands, were shot dead. For the Chinese government the Hong Kong demonstrators are defying the authority of a Communist leadership that cannot tolerate defiance. Another fear is some protesters’ demand for full independence. But military intervention would be a very risky strategy for Beijing

In 1993 Hong Kong’s GDP accounted for more than a quarter of mainland China’s. Today China’s remarkable rise means that Hong Kong’s economic output makes up less than 3% of the mainland’s. But Hong Kong remains important for China. Multinationals use it as a launch pad to the mainland and it gives Chinese companies access to the rest of the world.

So how the turmoil is resolved matters to more than just the people of Hong Kong. 

This all comes at a time when China and America are waging a trade and technology war. Bloodshed on Hong Kong’s streets would make relations deteriorate even further. Beijing is now blaming outsiders for the trouble.

For China the situation has become much more than a dispute over a law. It’s become an existential threat. Bruce and the other protesters are holding their breath.

China’s Communist rulers must choose between two mortal dangers - the collapse of economic stability and prosperity, or the acceptance that protests can limit the Party’s absolute power.

49,SscQBrJbiN0,The Economist,What does China want?,2014-08-27T14:23:40Z,25,"An animated infographic depicting China’s territorial disputes. Is China trying to expand its territory?

Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.trib.al/rWl91R7 

ONE reason China’s spectacular rise sometimes alarms its neighbours is that it is not a status quo power. From its inland, western borders to its eastern and southern seaboard, it claims territory it does not control.

In the west, China’s border dispute with India is more than a minor cartographic tiff.  China claims an area of India that is three times the size of Switzerland, the state of Arunachal Pradesh.

Further west, China occupies Indian claimed territory next to Ladakh in Kashmir, an area called the Aksai Chin. China humiliated India in a brief, bloody war over the dispute in 1962. Since 1988, the two countries have put the dispute on the backburner and got on with developing commercial ties, despite occasional flare-ups.

More immediately dangerous is the stand-off between China and Japan over disputed islands in the East China Sea, known as the Senkakus in Japan and Diaoyu in Chinese. 

Japan says they have always been its territory and admits no dispute, claiming also that China only started expressing an interest when it began to seem the area might be rich in oil and gas. 

A new and much more dangerous phase of the dispute began in 2012 after Japan’s government nationalised three of the islands by buying them from their private owner.

China accused Japan of breaking an understanding not to change the islands’ status. Ever since, it has been challenging not just Japan’s claim to sovereignty over the islands, but its claim to control them, sending Chinese ships and planes to patrol them.

Raising the stakes is Japan’s alliance with America, which says that though it takes no position on who owns the islands, they are covered by its defence treaty with Japan, since it administers them.

Especially provocative to America and Japan was China’s unilateral announcement in November 2013 of an Air-defence Identification Zone, covering the islands. 

The worry is less that big powers will deliberately go to war over these desolate little rocks, but that an accidental collision at sea or in the air might escalate unforeseeably.

Similar fears cloud disputes in the South China Sea, where the maritime claims in South-East Asia are even more complex, and, again, competition is made more intense by speculation about vast potential wealth in hydrocarbon resources.

Vietnam was incensed in May 2014 when China moved a massive oil-rig to drill for two months in what it claimed as its waters.

This was near the Paracel Islands, controlled by China since it evicted the former South Vietnamese from them in 1974.

To the south, China and Vietnam also claim the Spratly archipelago, as does Taiwan, whose claim in the sea mirrors China’s. But the Philippines also has a substantial claim. Malaysia and even tiny Brunei also have an interest. 

But it is with Vietnam and the Philippines that China’s disputes are most active. The Philippines accuses China of salami-slicing tactics, stealthily expanding its presence in disputed waters. In 1995 it evicted the Philippines from Mischief Reef, and in 2012 from Scarborough Shoal.

This year it has tried to stop the Philippines from resupplying a small garrison it maintains on the Second Thomas Shoal, and appears to be building an airstrip on the Johnson South Reef.

The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea—UNCLOS—is one forum for tackling these disputes. But UNCLOS cannot rule over territorial disputes, just over the waters habitable islands are entitled to.

And China and Taiwan point to a map published in the 1940s, showing a big U-shaped nine-dashed line around the edge of the sea. That, they say, is historically all China’s. This has no basis in international law, and the Philippines, to China’s fury, is challenging it at an UNCLOS tribunal. 

In fact China often fails to clarify whether its claims are based on the nine-dashed line, or on claims to islands, rocks and shoals.

That lack of clarity alarms not just its neighbours and rival claimants, but the United States, which says it has its own national interest in the freedom of navigation in a sea through which a huge chunk of global trade passes

Also alarming is that if these arguments over tiny specks in the sea become so unmanageable, what hope is there for resolving the really big issues? And the biggest of all is the status of Taiwan, still seen by China as part of its territory, but in practice independent since 1949.

For now, Taiwan and China have a thriving commercial relationship. But polls suggest that few in Taiwan hanker after unification with the mainland. And China’s rulers still insist that one day they will have to accept just that.",1232990,6765,,3249,PT4M7S
