A Tampa woman who fought off an attacker at her apartment complex's gym is speaking out about her experience in the hopes that other women will feel more empowered.

Nashali Alma, 24, said she was exercising in her complex's gym, about 12 miles northwest of downtown Tampa, in late January when a man who looked familiar to her needed access to the gym, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office said.

Alma said she let the man in because she had seen him in the gym before. But as she was working out, Alma told investigators that the man approached her and grabbed her waist. Alma said she yelled at the man to get away from her but he kept chasing her around the gym, police said.

President Joe Biden approved Gov. Pedro Pierluisi's request for a major disaster declaration on Wednesday, opening up more federal assistance. Meanwhile, the Federal Emergency Management Agency announced it will send hundreds of personnel to aid local response efforts, while the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency.

Puerto Rico experienced widespread landslides, damaged homes, washed-out bridges and downed power lines as torrential rains and flooding engulfed the island. Power company officials initially said it would take a few days for electricity to be fully restored, but then appeared to backtrack late Tuesday night. Only 26% had power as of Wednesday morning, three days after it hit the island.

150,n3IYmdy6d4Y,Vox,Here's what happens to your knuckles when you crack them,2015-03-09T13:19:18Z,25,"One man cracked his knuckles in one hand for 60 years and not the other. Watch the video to see what he found out.

There's a long-held myth that cracking your knuckles can damage your hands. The sound definitely might make people around you cringe, but what's making those noises, and is it actually bad for you?

There's a space in your joints filled with synovial fluid, a liquid that reduces the friction in your joints when you move. It contains gases (oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide).

When you pop a joint, you stretch out that space between the bones. That expanding space creates negative pressure, like a vacuum, that sucks in the synovial fluid. It forms bubbles, which then collapse, and that's what you hear.

Most medical sources agree that unless you experience pain when you pop your joints, you're probably fine to keep doing it. Researchers (including one man who cracked his knuckles on just one hand for 60 years) haven't established a connection between cracking your knuckles and arthritis.

One 1990 study of 300 people did find that cracking knuckles over a long period of time led to hand swelling and decreased grip strength, but there hasn't been any follow-up research on that.

Vestigial structures are evolution's leftovers — body parts that, through inheritance, have outlived the context in which they arose. Some of the most delightful reminders of the common ancestry we share with other animals, they show that the building blocks of the human body predate our species by hundreds of millions of years.

Forty-two percent of Americans say that humans were created in their present form within the past 10,000 years — a percentage that hasn't changed much since 1982, when Gallup started polling views on evolution.

Several lines of evidence, from the fossil record, comparative anatomy, and genetics, tell another story. But you don't have to read all the research to find signs of our evolutionary history — you can see it in the vestigial structures in each of our bodies, like the third molars that no longer fit in our mouths. For a few other examples, check out the video above.

1250,EQRZoxnnfbA,Voice of America,Coronavirus: El Salvador Declares State of Emergency in Prisons,2020-04-26T16:53:22Z,25,"Footage provided by El Salvador's Presidency show inmates at the Izalco prison lining up in tight lines during a security operation during the coronavirus pandemic, northwest of San Salvador, Saturday, April 25. 

Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele late on Friday ordered a 24-hour lockdown of prisons containing gang members, and said their leaders would be sent into solitary confinement after a sudden spike in homicides during the day.

Bukele said the “maximum emergency” lockdown would be enforced while police investigated some 22 homicides reported on Friday. 

Only a few years ago, El Salvador, which has long been plagued by powerful street gangs known as maras, had the highest homicide rate in the Americas.

El Salvador has imposed some of the strictest measures in the Americas to combat the spread of the coronavirus.

Riots have broken out at prisons all over the world including in Argentina, Cameroon, and Malawi as the global health crisis exaggerates.

Inmates are protesting hygiene conditions, lack of personal protection equipment and poor cell conditions, while some protested on the roof of prisons.

152,QMbHLF_zwjs,Vox,Why no aquarium has a great white shark,2016-07-08T13:52:58Z,25,"Many have tried to keep a white shark in captivity. Here's why that's so difficult.

✉️ Sign up for our newsletter: http://www.vox.com/video-newsletter

There are several aquariums around the world, including one in Georgia, that house whale sharks, the biggest fish in the sea. But not one has a great white shark on display. 

Aquariums have made dozens of attempts since the 1970s to display a captive great white shark. Most of those attempts ended with dead sharks. 

By the 2000s, the only group still trying was the Monterey Bay Aquarium, which spent a decade planning its white shark program. In 2004, it acquired a shark that became the first great white to survive in captivity for more than 16 days. In fact, it was on display for more than six months before it was released back into the ocean. 

In the following years, the Monterey Bay Aquarium hosted five more juvenile white sharks for temporary stays before ending the program in 2011. It was an expensive effort and had come under criticism due to injuries that some of the sharks developed in the tank. 

Responding to those critics, Jon Hoech, the aquarium's director of husbandry operations, said: ""We believe strongly that putting people face to face with live animals like this is very significant in inspiring ocean conservation and connecting people to the ocean environment. We feel like white sharks face a significant threats out in the wild and our ability to bring awareness to that is significant in terms of encouraging people to become ocean stewards."" 

Check out the video above to learn why white sharks are so difficult to keep in captivity and how the Monterey Bay Aquarium designed a program that could keep them alive.

2100,M2IQuXbExjU,ABC News In-depth,Inside Mexico's Most Powerful Drug Cartel | Foreign Correspondent,2021-07-22T10:00:11Z,25,"Tens of thousands are missing, many more murdered. So why are Mexico’s violent drug cartels operating with impunity? We go inside the most powerful cartel to meet the footsoldiers. Corruption, they say, goes right to the top. Produced in collaboration with Ben Zand and Vice TV.

In Mexico’s Sinaloa state, violence has become a way of life.
Home to the country’s most powerful drug syndicate, the Sinaloa cartel, murders and disappearances are rife.

The police, meant to protect the population, are often the targets of violence. Over 500 officers were killed in Mexico last year.

They’re also often complicit, with corruption in the police force and government a major problem.In this shocking portrait of a country caught in the grip of organised crime, reporter Ben Zand takes us where few have gone – inside the Sinaloa cartel in the Sierra Madre mountains where he witnesses the group’s operations up close.

At their hidden base, the group grows poppies and marijuana for export, fends off outsiders with guns and bribes visiting police and security officers with money and women.

“The government is the one in charge” say the local leader. “The cartel is only as big as the government wants us to be.”

Commentator and writer Ioan Grillo believes that the police and military used to have the upper hand with the cartels but says that’s now changed.

“Some of the cartels have become much more powerful,” says Grillo. “[now] the cartel is actually bullying and controlling elements of the security forces.”

It’s the community who’s paying the price for corruption and impunity. 
Mirna Quiñones’ son disappeared suddenly 7 years ago. When police refused to help her, she set out to find him herself. 

She went on to set up the Trackers of El Fuerte group which helps parents looking for their children. In the last seven years of searching, they’ve uncovered over two hundred bodies.

“There is no justice. We all know that. I have been threatened by the municipal police here. The government and crime are united.”

Interior Minister, Olga Sánchez Cordero, concedes there is corruption. “The trials, and the investigations, are deficient”, she says. “Lawyers are threatened. Judges are threatened. That is just the reality.”

But she maintains the government is doing its best to investigate the cartels and to undermine their support base. 

Investigative journalist Anabel Hernández disagrees, saying she has little faith the government of Andrés Manuel López Obrador, elected two and half years ago, will tackle the problem.

“He promised to do something different but….it’s just the same. Nothing changed. In some parts it's worse.""

153,TPpoJGYlW54,Vox,How wildlife trade is linked to coronavirus,2020-03-06T13:00:04Z,25,"And why the disease first appeared in China.

NOTE: As our expert Peter Li points out in the video, “The majority of the people in China do not eat wildlife animals. Those people who consume these wildlife animals are the rich and the powerful –a small minority.”  This video explains how the people of China are themselves victims of the conditions that led to coronavirus. The virus is affecting many different countries and cultures, and there is never justification for xenophobia or racism.

As of early March 2020, a new coronavirus, called COVID-19, is in more than 70 countries and has killed more than 3,100 people, the vast majority in China. That's where the virus emerged back in December 2019. This isn't a new phenomenon for China; in 2003, the SARS virus also emerged there, and under similar circumstances, before spreading around the world and killing nearly 800.

Both SARS and COVID-19 are in the ""coronavirus"" family, and both appear to have emerged from animals in China's notorious wildlife markets. Experts had long predicted that these markets, known to be potential sources of disease, would enable another outbreak. The markets, and the wildlife trade that supports them, are the underlying problem of these pandemics; until China solves that problem, more are likely to emerge.

With original music by Tom Fox: https://m.soundcloud.com/user-416166523

Hong Kong is the most expensive housing market in the world. It has been ranked as the least affordable housing market on Earth for eight years in a row, and the price per square foot seems to be only going up. The inflated prices are forcing Hongkongers to squeeze into unconventionally small spaces that can affect their quality of life. 

Tens of thousands of Hongkongers are living in spaces that range from 75 to 140 square feet. To put that in perspective, the average parking space in the US is about 150 square feet. And in the most extreme cases, Hongkongers have resorted to homes the size of a coffin. 

I spent some time exploring the living situation in Hong Kong to find out why housing has become so expensive and spaces so tight. 

To understand how Hong Kong’s housing market turned out this way and see how it’s affecting people’s lives, watch the final episode of Borders Hong Kong.

The clip, which was shown of Faroese Television, has since gone viral, racking up millions of hits on YouTube alone. The dead whale had been lying on the beach for two days, after getting stuck in the waters between two islands, when marine biologist Bjarni Mikkelsen was sent to cut it open. As he made incisions in the whale's side the carcass exploded due to a buildup of methane gas from the decomposition creating a loud sound and releasing a pungent smell. It is reported that a local museum will collect the skeleton and put it on display. Report by Laurie Blake.

He interrupted his remarks to help her: ""You're ok. I'm right here. I got you."" As one of his aides helped lead Mrs Allison away, he added: ""This happens when I talk too long.""

She later took to Twitter to thank the commander-in-chief for the catch, saying: ""I'm ok world- just got a little lightheaded.Thanks, @BarackObama for catching me! And good thing this pregnant diabetic is pregnant :)""

Help us make more ambitious videos by joining the Vox Video Lab: http://bit.ly/video-lab

Maps are flat representations of our spherical planet. Johnny Harris cut open a plastic globe to understand just what it takes to turn a sphere into something flat.

His struggle to make a flat map out of the plastic globe is indicative of a challenge mapmakers have faced for centuries: It is mathematically impossible to translate the surface of a sphere onto a plane without some form of distortion.

To solve this problem, mathematicians and cartographers have developed a huge library of representations of the globe, each distorting a certain attribute and preserving others.

For instance, the Mercator projection preserves the shape of countries while distorting the size, especially near the north and south pole.

For a more accurate view of land area look at the Gall-Peters projection, which preserves area while distorting shape.

In the end, there's not ""right"" map projection. Each comes with trade-offs, and cartographers make projection decisions based on the particular tasks at hand. But if you are interested in seeing an accurate depiction of the planet, it's best to stick with a globe.

Final polls show the race between President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden has tightened since mid-October, both nationally and in battleground states.

Biden's lead in USA TODAY's average of averages, which is based on data from RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight, reached double-digits on Oct. 12, but has since fallen back to a 7.5-percentage point lead. That leaves him back roughly in the same position USA TODAY found him in its first poll roundup on Sept. 28, when his polling average lead over Trump was 7.2 points. 

Beyond the presidency, Tuesday's election may result in changes in Congress, where Democrats want to regain control of the Republican-led Senate and Democrats hope to expand their advantage in the House.

Deciding it was too dangerous for the little one to continue her leisurely swim, the pooch gently grabbed hold of her shirt with his teeth and dragged her towards the beach. The youngster found this highly amusing and let out peels of laughter as she was guided towards safety.

701,qBwtCf2X5jw,The New York Times,"I Was the Fastest Girl in America, Until I Joined Nike | NYT Opinion",2019-11-07T16:00:11Z,25,"Mary Cain’s male coaches were convinced she had to get “thinner, and thinner, and thinner.” Then her body started breaking down. 

At 17, Mary Cain was already a record-breaking phenom: the fastest girl in a generation, and the youngest American runner to turn professional. In 2013, she was signed by the best track team in the world, Nike’s Oregon Project, run by its star coach Alberto Salazar.

Then everything collapsed. Her fall was just as spectacular as her rise, and she shares that story for the first time in the Video Op-Ed above.

Instead of becoming a symbol of girls’ unlimited potential in sports, Cain became yet another standout young athlete who got beaten down by a win-at-all-costs culture. Girls like Cain become damaged goods and fade away. We rarely hear what happened to them. We move on.

The problem is so widespread it affected the only other female athlete featured in the last Nike video ad Cain appeared in, the figure skater Gracie Gold. When the ad came out in 2014, like Cain, Gold was a prodigy considered talented enough to win a gold medal at the next Olympics. And, like Cain, Gold got caught in a system where she was compelled to become thinner and thinner. She developed disordered eating to the point of imagining her own death.

“America loves a good child prodigy story, and business is ready and waiting to exploit that story, especially when it comes to girls,” said Lauren Fleshman, who ran for Nike until 2012. “When you have these kinds of good girls, girls who are good at following directions to the point of excelling, you’ll find a system that’s happy to take them. And it’s rife with abuse.”

We don’t typically hear from the casualties of these systems — the girls who tried to make their way in this system until their bodies broke down and they left the sport. It’s easy to focus on bright new stars, while forgetting about those who disappeared. We fetishize these athletes, but we don’t protect them. If they fail to pull off what we expect them to, we abandon them.

But Mary Cain’s story isn’t over. By speaking out, she’s making sure of that.

Vladimir Putin has been ruling Russia since 1999. In that time he has shaped the country into an authoritarian and militaristic society. The Soviet Union dissolved into 15 new countries, including the new Russian Federation. In Putin’s eyes, Russia had just lost 2 million square miles of territory. But Putin’s regime has also developed and fostered the most effect cyber hacker army in the world and he’s used it to wreak havoc in the West. But the election of Donald Trump brings new hope for the Putin vision. Trump’s rhetoric has been notably soft on Russia. He could lift sanctions and weaken NATO, potentially freeing up space for Putin’s Russia to become a dominant power once again.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

One of the biggest myths about the Israel-Palestine conflict is that it's been going on for centuries, that this is all about ancient religious hatreds.

In fact, while religion is involved, the conflict is mostly about two groups of people who claim the same land. And it really only goes back about a century, to the early 1900s. At its heart, it is a conflict between two self-determination movements — the Jewish Zionist project and the Palestinian nationalist project — that lay claim to the same territory.

The Saudis and Iranians have never actually declared war on each other. Instead, they fight indirectly by supporting opposing sides in other countries and inciting conflicts. This is known as proxy warfare. 

And it’s had a devastating effect on the region. Countries, especially poor ones, can’t function if there are larger countries pulling strings within their borders. 

And that’s exactly what's happening in the Middle East. The Saudi-Iranian rivalry has become a fight over influence, and the whole region is a battlefield.

Four years ago, intimate photographs of Danish journalist Emma Holten were posted on the web. Thousands viewed them and she still receives online harassment. The issues of revenge porn and hacked photos are part of a larger problem with our relationship to consent, she argues. So Holten decided to pose for and release a new set of pictures of her body. Here she explains why.

250,ZlRObEeuuJM,Al Jazeera English,Is Bangladesh a one-party state? | Head to Head,2019-03-01T05:37:50Z,25,"In this episode of Head to Head, Mehdi Hasan challenges Gowher Rizvi, the International Affairs advisor to the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, on the state of the country’s democracy and whether it is heading towards authoritarianism.

Once one of the poorest countries in the region, Bangladesh’s economy has been booming over the last decade, with economic growth faster than its neighbours, India and Pakistan. It also boasts lower infant mortality and longer life expectancy than its peers. 

However, human rights groups warn that the country is becoming increasingly autocratic, accusing the government of clamping down on any form of dissent and hounding and locking up its political rivals. 

In recent elections Bangladesh’s ruling party, the Awami League, reasserted its power following a landslide general election victory. The opposition rejected the results, amid violence which saw 17 killed and allegations of vote-rigging and intimidation. 

Our guest on Head to Head is Gowher Rizvi, close ally of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and advisor on international affairs.  Mr Rizvi is also a renowned historian and former Oxford University scholar.  

We challenge Mr Rizvi on Sheikh Hasina’s government’s record in office and whether it is increasingly trying to silence its critics. We also ask him about the ongoing Rohingya crisis, where over 1 million refugees have fled Myanmar and are living in camps in Bangladesh. Is Bangladesh doing enough to help?

We are joined by a panel of three experts:

Saida Muna Tasneem, Bangladesh's High Commissioner to the UK and Ireland.

Abbas Faiz, South Asia analyst at Essex University, previously worked for Amnesty International for more than 30 years.

Tasneem Khalil, Swedish Bangladeshi journalist, author of Jallad: Death Squads and State Terror in South Asia.

Is Bangladesh a one-party state? with Gohwer Rizvi will be broadcast on March 1 at 20:00 GMT and will be repeated on March 2nd at 12:00 GMT, March  3rd at 01:00 GMT and March 4th at 06:00 GMT.

Head to Head is Al Jazeera's forum for ideas, a gladiatorial contest tackling big issues such as faith, nationalism, democracy and foreign intervention, in front of an opinionated audience at the Oxford Union.

Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Sunday, announced a set of stimulus packages worth $8.5 billion to help the country's economy ride out the damage inflicted by the pandemic.

In a speech broadcast live from her office in Dhaka, Hasina said the money would be mostly provided as low-interest loans to hard-hit manufacturers and small and medium-sized enterprises.

Garment workers, who had first rushed to Dhaka to get back to work, were told on Sunday that their vacations had been extended and that they had to turn back.

Crowds broke army cordons to rush on to ferries that would take them back to their hometowns.

The country is now under a lockdown.

Robert Hooper, 57, was on trial at Durham Crown Court after he used his tractor to lift a Vauxhall Corsa and drop it on the road outside his property in Newbiggin-in-Teesdale last June.

Passenger Charlie Burns, 21, who had been visiting the area that day and had drunk up to seven bottles of lager, was knocked to the floor by the vehicle's lifting forks.

The Russia President presented Kim with a tea set. In return, Putin was gifted with a ceremonial sword. Putin and Kim said they had good talks about their joint efforts to resolve a standoff over Pyongyang's nuclear program, amid stalled negotiations with the United States. Kim's first trip to Russia comes about two months after his second summit with US President Donald Trump failed because of disputes over US-led sanctions on the North. Putin meanwhile wants to expand Russia's clout in the region and get more leverage with Washington.

This Sky News Australia special investigation into the origins of COVID-19 reveals what really happened in Wuhan in the early days of the pandemic.

Award-winning journalist Sharri Markson spent more than a year investigating the potential leak of the virus from a top-secret laboratory in Wuhan.

Ms Markson uncovered evidence of a widespread cover-up and unpacks the new theory that “patient zero” worked in the Wuhan lab.

Sky News Australia anchor and Investigations Writer at The Australian, Sharri has been at the forefront of investigating the origins of COVID-19 since early in 2020 when the virus spread globally. Since that time, the precise genesis of COVID-19 has been hotly contested, with scientists, government officials, the World Health Organization, and the Chinese authorities releasing conflicting reports.

In a coup for Australian television, Sharri secures the first sit-down interview for an Australian broadcast media outlet with Donald Trump since he was elected president in 2016. 

Sharri also speaks with a range of Chinese whistle-blowers, scientists, and high-ranking intelligence officials to bring us closer to discovering the truth of what happened in Wuhan. 

These include John Ratcliffe, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence from 2020 to 2021, and former head of British intelligence service, Mi6, Sir Richard Dearlove.",13316674.0,233564,43049,PT59M46S

164,luTPMHC7zHY,Vox,Why China is building islands in the South China Sea,2017-02-17T13:16:38Z,25,"China claims they aren't military bases, but their actions say otherwise. 

Join the Vox Video Lab: http://bit.ly/video-lab

Since 2014, China has been building islands in the middle of the South China Sea. What were once underwater reefs are now sandy islands complete with airfields, roads, buildings, and missile systems. In less than two years, China has turned seven reefs into seven military bases in the South China Sea, one of the most contentious bodies of water in the world.

The sea is one of the most important areas of ocean in the world. It’s estimated to hold 11 billion barrels of oil, 109 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 10 percent of the world’s fisheries. Most importantly, 30 percent of the world’s shipping trade flows through the South China Sea to the busy ports of Southeast Asia. It’s an incredibly important strategic area, and five countries currently claim some part of it.

Most countries base their claims off the United Nations Law of the Seas, which says a country’s territory extends 200 miles off its shores, an area called the exclusive economic zone, or EEZ. Any trade or resources that fall in a country’s EEZ belong to that country; they’re its sovereign territory. Any area that is not in an EEZ is considered international waters and subject to UN maritime law, meaning it’s shared by everyone. Every country in the region, which includes Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, and Vietnam, bases its claim to the South China Sea on the UN’s EEZ laws — except China.

China argues it has a historical claim to the South China Sea, dating back to naval expeditions in the 15th century. After World War II, the Japanese Empire lost control of the South China Sea, and China took advantage of the moment to reclaim it. On maps, it started drawing a dashed line that encompassed most of the South China Sea. This line became its official claim and is known today as the Nine-Dash Line, because it always has nine dashes. In 1973, when the UN law established EEZs, China reaffirmed its Nine-Dash Line, refusing to clarify the line’s boundaries and rejecting other countries’ claims.

Since then, tensions have built around who rightfully owns the South China Sea. The dispute has centered on the Spratly Islands, an archipelago at the heart of the South China Sea. Currently, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam claim some part of the Spratly Island chain. They’ve asserted their claims by putting small buildings, ports, and even some people on what are essentially rocks in the middle of the ocean.

But the Spratlys are very important, because whichever country can successfully claim them can extend its EEZ to include them, thus gaining miles of precious sovereign territory. This is why China began building up islands in 2014. By turning these rocks into military bases, the Chinese are now able to support hundreds of ships, bolstering their presence in the region. They are using fishing boats, surveillance ships, and navy destroyers to set up blockades around other countries’ islands and defend their own. This is all done very cautiously and in small steps in order to avoid sparking a wider conflict.

Since China began building islands, the disputes have not become violent. But tensions are building in the region. As China deploys more of its military to the Spratlys, other countries are getting nervous and building up their own islands. It’s a complex situation that will continue to gain international attention, for better or for worse.

165,TVe5XPU10Zc,Vox,How fan films shaped The Lego Movie,2017-06-15T13:07:45Z,25,"The 2014 film was an animation feat — but it was built on the legacy of homemade fan movies. 

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

When you watch installments of the Warner Bros. line of Lego movies, it's hard not to be struck by how realistic the animation is. It isn't quite traditional stop motion — but it sure looks as if it could be. That's largely thanks to the work of the animators at Animal Logic, a Sydney-based visual effects studio that has worked on The Lego Movie, The Lego Batman Movie, and the upcoming The Lego Ninjago Movie. Powered by live action filming techniques and a close attention to detail, the studio has helped reinvent what Lego animations can look like. But they owe a lot of that aesthetic to the influence of fan films. Since the early 1970s, enthusiasts have made home movies with their own Lego sets. They're called Brickfilms — and they've grown into a sizable community producing great movies and helping many young animators get their start. The Lego Movie animators learned from what made those home movies so good by embracing the limitations of the medium, and creating a world that anyone could could rebuild at home. 

Check out some of the Brickfilms we showed in this video:

Chad and Amy Kempel already had 2 children when they found out that Amy was pregnant with quintuplets.

Before having their 7 children, the Kempels struggled with infertility. They had multiple miscarriages and lost twin boys at 22 weeks. Despite the odds, Amy carried her 5 babies to 27 weeks at which point doctors needed to intervene for medical reasons. The quintuplets were delivered by C-section 3 months early and spent 73 days in the NICU until they were ready to go home.

After the babies made it home safely, Chad and Amy had to figure out how to make it work. Amy chose to stay at home while Chad went to work each morning at 4am. So Chad came up with a variety of creative solutions to help streamline daily activities — including a prop feeding system and an end table with highchairs built in.

Chad shares his inventions on his YouTube channel, calling them Quint Hacks — see more here: https://www.youtube.com/user/ChadKempel.

Russia, in its biggest deployment to Belarus since the Cold War ended, is expected to have 30,000 troops as well as fighter jets and missile systems for the joint exercises that run until Feb. 20, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said.

The presence of a large Russian force in Belarus has added to western fears that Russia could be preparing to attack Ukraine on multiple fronts. Moscow denies any such intention and says the exercises are defensive in nature.

Ukraine said Russia currently has a total of 115,000 troops near its borders.

Wuhan — a city more populous than London or New York — placed in ‘lockdown’ following the outbreak of the new and deadly coronavirus.

In China, more than two thousand people have died, with tens of thousands more infected, and authorities are resorting to extreme measures to try to halt the contagion. In interviews filmed on smartphones, Chinese activists and Australians trapped in the lockdown explain what they are going through.

Four Corners charts how the outbreak occurred and investigates whether a cover-up by Chinese authorities allowed the virus to spread.

But while top military officials have repeatedly sounded the alarm about Russian and Chinese activities in other parts of the world, from Europe to Asia to Africa, there is a sense that not enough attention has been paid to what both countries have been able to do in South and Central America. https://www.voanews.com/a/us-wary-russia-china-south-central-america/4429832.html

But there have never been recommended limits for sugar on Canadian food labels, despite emerging research that suggests the sweet stuff may be making more of us fat and sick. In the fifth estate’s season premiere, Gillian Findlay digs into the surprising science — and the reaction from the food industry — to reveal The Secrets of Sugar. Has the sugar industry been hiding an unsavoury truth from consumers?

A small but influential group of medical researchers is stirring up the health debate, linking sugar not just to rising obesity rates but also to a host of diseases including cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer’s.

We put a family of four on a healthy diet to try to beat their sugar habit and track the surprising results. We talk to leading scientists – and their critics. And we ask the food industry why those ingredient labels are far from clear when it comes to how much sugar is really on your plate.

Sure enough, there it is, like 25 million. And there must be a big spike for World War II, and there it is, it's like 65 million. But then you'll see this other spike that is as large as World War II right after World War I, and most people, would say, 'What was that?'""

""Well, that was the Spanish flu.""

In a 1990 paper on ""The Anthropology of Infectious Disease,"" Marcia Inhorn and Peter Brown estimated that infectious diseases ""have likely claimed more lives than all wars, noninfectious diseases, and natural disasters put together."" 

Infectious diseases are our oldest, deadliest foe.

And they remain so today. ""In a good year, flu kills over 10,000 Americans,"" says Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""In a bad year, it kills over five times that. If we have a pandemic, it will be much worse. People think the H1N1 flu wasn’t so bad. But more than 1,000 American kids died from H1N1!""

Schwartzlow, 17, managed to flee the Rock County Sheriff’s Office in Janesville after being left alone in an interview room. The teenager had been hauled from his classroom at Orfordville Parkview High School on October 18 and arrested on suspicion of strangulation in an August 1 assault. Footage shows the teen heading straight for the window as the detective leaves the room. He opens the blinds and pushes the window out before diving headfirst from 12ft up. A second camera picks him up sprinting across the lawn making his getaway. About 14 minutes later, the detective returns to find the room empty and the window wide open, before uttering: 'Ah, no f****** way'.

However, a woman from Germany has avoided the 'unthinkable' and broken a world record instead. Julia Plecher, from Ruckersdorf, has run 100 metres in 14.531 seconds, wearing shiny golden heels. She has raced into the Guinness World Records and has been included in its 2014 book.

Julia has a history of running in heels. She took part in a 'stiletto race' in Berlin back in 2009, and despite the rule being a seven centimetre heel, she chose an 8.5 cm one. She ended up winning the race.

Julia has previously said the key to not falling over is unsurprisingly now the show is made.

""You need shoes which ideally are closed in the front because you run on the front part of the foot. You have to be careful not to slip out. I think sandals would not be too appropriate,"" Plecher said. Report by Ashley Fudge.

169,K3odScka55A,Vox,Why you can't compare Covid-19 vaccines,2021-03-20T12:00:13Z,28,"What a vaccine's ""efficacy rate"" actually means.

Sign up for our newsletter: http://www.vox.com/video-newsletter

In the US, the first two available Covid-19 vaccines were the ones from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. Both vaccines have very high ""efficacy rates,"" of around 95%. But the third vaccine introduced in the US, from Johnson & Johnson, has a considerably lower efficacy rate: just 66%.

Look at those numbers next to each other, and it's natural to conclude that one of them is considerably worse. Why settle for 66% when you can have 95%? But that isn't the right way to understand a vaccine's efficacy rate, or even to understand what a vaccine does. And public health experts say that if you really want to know which vaccine is the best one, efficacy isn't actually the most important number at all.

Help our reporting on hidden histories. Submit a story idea here: http://bit.ly/2RhjxMy

If you’ve been to New York, you’ve probably visited Central Park. But there’s a part of its story you won't see. 

It’s a story that goes back to the 1820s, when that part of New York was largely open countryside. Soon it became home to about 1,600 people. Among them was a predominantly black community that bought up affordable plots to build homes, churches and a school. It became known as Seneca Village. And when Irish and German immigrants moved in, it became a rare example at the time of an integrated neighborhood.

Everything changed on July 21, 1853. New York took control of the land to create what would become the first major landscaped park in the US -- they called it “The Central Park.” 

In the Vox series Missing Chapter, Vox Senior Producer Ranjani Chakraborty revisits underreported and often overlooked moments from the past to give context to the present. Join her as she covers the histories that are often left out of our textbooks. Our first season tackles stories of racial injustice, political conflicts, even the hidden history of US medical experimentation.

On February 24th, Russia launched a military invasion of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin called it a “special military operation,” but the scale of the attack shows this is a full-scale war that has already caused more than 100 casualties and forced more than half a million Ukrainians to flee their homes.

Ukraine and Russia’s conflict goes back to 2014, when Russia invaded and annexed Crimea and Russian-backed separatist forces took over parts of southeastern Ukraine’s Donbas region. But to understand the full context behind the invasion, it’s important to go even farther back, to the time when Europe’s current-day divisions began, and see how that shaped Europe’s power balance today. 

To understand the current conflict’s history in less than 10 minutes, watch the video above.

Elegant Olympic dives fly by in a matter of seconds. Because of that, it’s hard to know what to look for when you try to judge the sport from your couch. One thing that’s easy to see, though? The splash.

If you’ve watched any Olympics diving coverage, you may have noticed that the splashes athletes make are tiny. Divers spend years training to perform with minimal splash, in the same way that gymnasts train to stick their landings.

In this video, Team USA’s head diving coach Drew Johansen explains the three major components he uses to guide his athletes towards smaller splashes: the above water position, the underwater swim, and the underwater pike. 

And while the sport of diving isn’t all about getting splashes, a small splash is the perfect punctuation to a job well done.

They were held hostage for 388 days and freed when a private ransom was paid, mostly be members of their extended family.

He came up with the idea to stimulate the country's low birth rate, promising to personally baptise every third child in each family.

The patriarch blessed 780 children during the day.

Cash is illegal in prisons. And that means everything from tuna to stamps to cigarettes have their own unique value in a trade and barter market. 

But ramen has quickly taken over as the most in demand products the prison system offers.

Very much so. In fact, research says it's more effective than looking good.

Signaling availability and interest trumps attractiveness. Via How to Make Someone Fall in Love With You in 90 Minutes or Less:

Dr. Monica Moore, a psychologist at Webster University in St. Louis, has conducted research on the flirting techniques used in singles bars, shopping malls, and places young people go to meet each other. She concluded that it's not the most physically appealing people who get approached, but the ones who signal their availability and confidence through basic flirting techniques like eye contact and smiles. Just signaling your interest in someone gets you halfway there, whether you're a man or a woman.""* The Young Turks hosts Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian break it down.

There's a door on the 10th floor in the Vox Media office I hate so much. You probably know one of these too.  But it's not our fault.

And luckily, Roman Mars of 99% Invisible magically arrived in my cellphone to send me on a cross-country journey to find out the incredible surprises behind this common complaint: 

Don Norman started complaining about doors over 25 years ago. Doors shouldn't need instructions – the shape of them can guide you through just fine.  So why do so many doors need instruction manuals right on the side of them?  

When most people complain about something, nothing happens. Don Norman is not most people – he's a psychologist and cognitive scientist.  Don Norman thought about, and wrote about his complaints so incredibly thoroughly that he changed the world.  99% Invisible's Roman Mars helps tell the story.

177,NVH7JewfgJg,Vox,Why South Africa is still so segregated,2021-04-12T12:00:19Z,25,"How centuries of division built one of the most unequal countries on earth.

Subscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (🔔) http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

For decades, South Africa was under apartheid: a series of laws that divided people by race. Then, in the 1990s, those laws were dismantled. But many of the barriers they created continue to divide South Africans by skin color - which in turn determines their quality of life, access to jobs, and wealth. Racial division was built into the fabric of cities throughout South Africa, and it still hasn't been uprooted.

That's partly because, while apartheid was the culmination of South Africa's racial divisions, it wasn't the beginning of them. That story starts closer to the 1800s, when the British built a network of railroads that transformed the region's economy into one that excluded most Black people -- and then made that exclusion the law.

Sources and further reading:

If you want to learn more about the railroads and how they impacted Cape Colony’s economy, check out this paper by Johan Fourie and Alonso Herranz Loncan:

The moment of the massive explosion that rocked the Lebanese capital Beirut, killing more than 137 people and injuring thousands, was captured in high definition by a shop owner who was recording when the blast hit.

Video shows smoke rising from Beirut's port with small sparks being seen in what is believed to be fireworks that were set off by the blaze. According to reports, fireworks were stored in the same warehouse where 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate had previously been stored. After several seconds of recording, a massive explosion bursts outwards, which then moves outwards towards where the shop owner is, the resulting shockwave impacting multiple buildings in the process.

After four-plus years of fighting, Syria's war has killed at least hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions. And, though it started as a civil war, it's become much more than that. It's a proxy war that has divided much of the Middle East, and has drawn in both Russia and the United States. To understand how Syria got to this place, it helps to start at the beginning and watch it unfold:

The sixth and last Vox Borders episode deals with a border between Morocco and Spain. The journey to asylum is never easy. And perhaps no one knows this better than would-be African migrants to the European Union. In North Africa, on the border of Morocco, there's a Spanish town called Melilla. It's technically Europe.

So undocumented migrants and refugees, asylum seekers, wait in limbo for a chance to scale the fence and apply for asylum in Europe. It's the first of many, many hurdles. And it's a tall one.

Today’s Republican Party opposes big government. It’s culturally conservative. Its demographic support is strongest among white voters, and it usually dominates elections in the South. And its 2016 presidential nominee has been heavily criticized for inciting racial tensions.

But things weren’t always this way. 

Over the past 160 or so years, the party has undergone a remarkable transformation from the party of Abraham Lincoln… to the party of Donald Trump.

Check out the Today, Explained podcast episode on El Chapo here: https://bit.ly/2DaFZS8

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Throughout his career as a drug trafficker, tunnels have been the common theme in El Chapo’s story. When he gained control of a major drug trafficking corridor in the late 1980s, Joaquin Guzman Loera — then known as “el Rapido”— was the first to create super tunnels for transporting drugs across the border.

At the time, a crackdown by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) meant Colombian cocaine was in decline and the Mexican narcotrafficker saw an opportunity. By using tunnels to facilitate fast transport, El Chapo leveraged his role as a trafficker to claim new responsibilities as a cultivator and distributor of drugs. 

Over the next twenty years, he learned how to use his drug tunnels in ways nobody had ever imagined and his success became dependent on his subterranean inclinations. Although his masterful use of tunnels led him to a maximum security jail cell at Altiplano prison, it would be tunnels that also led him back out again.

Mohammad bin Salman was designated as Saudi Arabia's new crown prince in June 2017. Since then, he has rapidly consolidated power and led Saudi Arabia towards some progressive reforms, such as granting women the right to drive. He also has plans to privatize certain segments of the economy, with the goal of reducing Saudi Arabia's economic dependency on oil. These changes, along with a suppression of Saudi Arabia's religious Right, could potentially begin to destabilize one of the Middle East's most powerful nations.

John Coltrane, one of jazz history’s most revered saxophonists, released “Giant Steps” in 1959. It’s known across the jazz world as one of the most challenging compositions to improvise over for two reasons - it’s fast and it’s in three keys. Braxton Cook and Adam Neely give me a crash course in music theory to help me understand this notoriously difficult song, and I’m bringing you along for the ride. Even if you don’t understand a lick of music theory, you’ll likely walk away with an appreciation for this musical puzzle.

As the city prepares to receive an influx of international visitors, it is building new infrastructure and transportation systems to accommodate the surge. But the city is also undergoing another major project: hiding and removing poor people from view of foreign onlookers. I went to Rio to see how the city is transforming to make way for the Olympics

Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy 

Every night almost everyone on the planet enters into a state of unconsciousness and paralysis - but what is really happening inside the body when we drift off, and what's the impact if we don't get enough sleep?

Sleep is regulated by your circadian rhythm, or body clock located in the brain. The body clock responds to light hews ramping up production of the hormone melatonin at night, and switching it off when it senses light. 

There are four stages of sleep that the body experiences in cycles throughout the night. On a good night we cycle through these stages four or five times. 

Stages one and two are light sleep. This is a transition from being awake to falling asleep. Heart rate and breathing begin to slow, body temperature falls, and muscles may twitch. Stage 3 is sometimes referred to as Delta sleep - because of the slow Delta brainwaves that are released during this stage. This is the first stage of deep sleep where our cells produce the most growth hormone to service bones and muscles, allowing the body to repair itself. Stage 4 is where we begin to dream. The body creates chemicals that render it temporarily paralyzed so that we do not act out our dreams. In this stage, the brain is extremely active and our eyes, although closed, dark back and forth as if we were awake.

Humans roughly spend one third of their lives asleep. Modern lifestyles, stress and the proliferation of Technology, mean that people is sleeping far less today than they were a century ago. 

Sleeping less than seven hours per day is associated with an increased risk of developing chronic conditions which could reduce life expectancy.

So for a healthier longer life get some shut-eye

185,6_RdnVtfZPY,Vox,"Hong Kong’s huge protests, explained",2019-06-22T12:00:00Z,25,"The people of Hong Kong are protesting in record-breaking numbers. 

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

Correction at 7:48: The protester says “They are not doing this for themselves, but for the future of Hong Kong.”

Hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers have taken to the streets to protest a controversial extradition bill that could send Hong Kong residents to mainland China to be tried in court. Hong Kong’s Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, says the bill is meant to prevent Hong Kong from becoming a safe haven for fugitives. But its opponents fear that Hong Kong would be exposed to China’s flawed judicial system, which would lead to further erasure of the city’s judicial independence.

At first Lam was determined to move forward with the bill. But after a series of massive protests, she announced she would “indefinitely suspend” the bill. But protesters aren't accepting the suspension, and have started demanding its complete withdrawal. They've also begun calling for Lam’s resignation.

But this rise in tensions is about a lot more than a bill. To understand why this bill hits a nerve with Hongkongers, it's important to understand Hong Kong’s relationship with China - and exactly how the bill would tip the scales in China’s favor.

In US news and current events today, teacher Amanda Coffman resigned on the spot during a school board meeting and delivered a powerful message to her former students. 

Coffman is a former teacher at Indian Woods Middle School in Kansas. She says she resigned because she felt ‘silenced’ when Shawnee Mission School District issued teachers new 3-year contracts. 

Coffman says the contracts don’t address the concerns or needs that the teachers have fought for in the past.

After prohibition — the total ban on alcohol — many states established a minimum legal drinking age of 21. But that began to change after the voting age was lowered to 18. Many states followed by lowering their drinking ages, which changed the landscape for the entire country.

By the 1980s, this unusual patchwork of drinking ages started to be seen as a problem, especially by activist organizations like MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Drivers) and RID (Remove Intoxicated Drivers). They lobbied for a 21-year-old minimum legal drinking age, and President Ronald Reagan supported the cause. His mechanism for enabling a national law? Threatening to withhold Federal Highway funding to states that didn’t comply.

It was an unpredictable strategy for an official typically hesitant to use federal power over the states, and the practice was eventually challenged in the Supreme Court, where it was upheld.

Beyond the political clash, it’s a look at how roads shape policy.

The sawn-off shotgun, which police say could have further fuelled the city's spiralling violence, was found hidden behind a wheelie bin nearby.

Seven-year-old Uma Rumsey and her sister, Maya, who's five, were taken to Victoria Place shopping centre, next to Victoria Station. They were left alone separately - but with tight security around them - obviously alone and looking in need of help. The cameras recorded men and women clearly seeing them - and ignoring them. A total of 616 adults passed them by in just one hour. The one person who did finally ask Maya if she needed help did so only after doubling back and making sure the child was alone. She was Pearl Pitcher, who said: ""I was very hesitant to come and ask her, but I thought I must come back - just in case. I think the older generation would stop, but very cautiously, a bit like I was"". A spokesman for the NSPCC said: ""We have got to get a message out to adults that they have a responsibility to protect children and that must supersede any concern you have for other people's perception of why you are reaching out to help that child"". The experiment, which was to test the public's reaction to lost children, was carried out for a programme by ITN Productions on Channel 5, called ""Little Girl Lost: A Police 5 Special"", which will air on Tuesday 25th March at 6.30pm.

In many states — including California, New York and Illinois — Democrats control all the levers of power. They run the government. They write the laws. And as we explore in the video above, they often aren’t living up to their values.

In key respects, many blue states are actually doing worse than red states. It is in the blue states where affordable housing is often hardest to find, there are some of the most acute disparities in education funding and economic inequality is increasing most quickly.

Instead of asking, “What’s the matter with Kansas?” Democrats need to spend more time pondering, “What’s the matter with California?”

Stretching 855 miles (1,375km) across the north of the country, at its source in the Himalayas its water is crystal clear. 

However, once it streams through New Delhi, it turns into one of the filthiest rivers in the world. Rapid urbanisation is partly to blame, but so is lax enforcement of laws against illegal dumping.

» Subscribe to NowThis: http://go.nowth.is/News_Subscribe

In US news, high school graduate Nataly Buhr shocked the audience and the world with her San Ysidro High School valedictorian speech. The headlines will surely read 'Valedictorian shocks world with brutally honest speech,' because in this grad speech she called out teachers and school staff for being negligent and accused one faculty of being a drunk teacher. Buhr hoped students would find her graduation speech inspirational. A rep from Sweetwater Union High School District called the speech 'unfortunate.' Buhr is evidently not the teachers pet.

Footage has captured the devastation after huge boulders crashed through and destroyed a barn in northern Italy. An estimated four thousand cubic meters of rock came loose from a cliff face above the site, before destroying most of the 300-year-old building. Huge scars were left in the hillside where the jagged rocks had rolled, with surrounding vineyards also left badly damaged. No one was injured in the incident. Report by Sophie Foster.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

In the few short years since the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria formed, it has done the seemingly impossible, seizing vast areas of the Middle East to form a mini-state it calls a reincarnation of the ancient Caliphate. It is at war with all its neighbors and virtually the entire world, yet someone remains, and is launching increasingly deadly terror attacks abroad.

To understand how this terrible group came about and how it has grown so powerful, you need to understand the story behind its rise. And that is a story that goes back decades, to long before ISIS existed.

More than 20 Russian aircraft and two coastguard ships were shadowing a British warship, HMS Defender, when the Russians claim they've fired warning shots and dropped bombs in the path of the British ship, accusing it of violating Russian territorial waters. The British deny that account.

Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and claims the peninsula and its waters are Russian territory.  However  the UK says HMS Defender was passing through Ukrainian waters, in an internationally recognised route.

The only broadcast journalist on board HMS Defender was from the BBC.

Huw Edwards presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Jonathan Beale, who describes the hostile warnings from Russia and HMS Defender’s response the confrontation.

Most fish die the same way — slow suffocation in the open air. It’s easy for fishers, but it causes fish tons of stress, and floods their bodies with chemicals like cortisol, adrenaline, and lactic acid. Those chemicals make the fish taste bad, smell “fishy,” and rot quickly. 

But there's a better way: a four-step Japanese method called ikejime. It involves sharp knives. And a brain spike. 

We adapted this video from Vox’s Future Perfect podcast, which goes much more in depth on ikejime: https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/14/18091698/future-perfect-podcast-killing-fish-ikejime-animal-welfare

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

These days, pro golfers are hitting the ball far. Really far. And it's creating a problem: because modern golfers can reach the hole with fewer shots than before, older courses -- like Augusta National Golf Club, Oakmont Country Club, and others -- are becoming obsolete. Now, professional organizations, like the United States Golf Association, are struggling to find a solution for big powerful golfers like Dustin Johnson, Bubba Watson, and Tiger Woods. While the jump in distance is due to lots of factors, conversation is centering on the controversial possibility of redesigning the golf ball to reduce distance. It'd be the latest turn in the ball's long history: Golf balls have evolved from ""featheries,"" to gutties, to balata balls, and eventually dimpled modern balls. But the biggest, and most recent change? The almost-instantaneous switch from wound balls to solid core multilayer balls like the Titleist Pro V1.

Venezuela was once the richest country in Latin America. It has the largest known oil reserves in the world and its democratic government was once praised world wide.

But today, Venezuela’s democratic institutions and its economy are in shambles.The country has the highest inflation in the world, making food and medicine inaccessible to most Venezuelans. 

Over the last four years, its GDP has fallen 35%, which is a sharper drop than the one seen during the Great Depression in the US. The country’s murder rate has surpassed that of the most dangerous cities in the world.

These conditions have sparked months of protests against the president, Nicolas Maduro. And it’s easy to see why: the country has become measurably worse since his election in 2013.

192,iMtXqTmfta0,Vox,The world is poorly designed. But copying nature helps.,2017-11-09T13:00:36Z,25,"Biomimicry design, explained with 99% Invisible. Check them out here:  https://99percentinvisible.org/

Japan’s Shinkansen doesn’t look like your typical train. With its long and pointed nose, it can reach top speeds up to 150–200 miles per hour. 

It didn’t always look like this. Earlier models were rounder and louder, often suffering from the phenomenon of ""tunnel boom,"" where deafening compressed air would rush out of a tunnel after a train rushed in. But a moment of inspiration from engineer and birdwatcher Eiji Nakatsu led the system to be redesigned based on the aerodynamics of three species of birds. 

Nakatsu’s case is a fascinating example of biomimicry, the design movement pioneered by biologist and writer Janine Benyus. She's a co-founder of the Biomimicry Institute, a non-profit encouraging creators to discover how big challenges in design, engineering, and sustainability have often already been solved through 3.8 billion years of evolution on earth. We just have to go out and find them. 

This is one of a series of videos we're launching in partnership with 99% Invisible, an awesome podcast about design. 99% Invisible is a member of http://Radiotopia.fm

In the ’80s, scientists discovered there was a hole in the ozone over the South Pole. A significant layer of gas that deflects much of the sun’s radiation was disappearing much faster than anyone expected. Projections suggested it would collapse by 2050, increasing skin cancer rates, harming crops, and destroying the marine food chain. The situation was dire. But today, we are on the path to recovery.

Dr. Susan Solomon, among other scientists, contributed key findings to understand what was depleting the ozone layer and how to address it. In this video she takes us back to her expedition to Antarctica, breaks down how we managed to fix this huge problem, and looks at our next big environmental challenge — climate change — with the unbridled optimism that drove her to fix the ozone hole.

Haiti and the Dominican Republic share a border, and an island. But the two countries are very different today: the Dominican Republic enjoys higher quality of life for many factors than Haiti. I went to this island and visited both countries, to try and understand when and how their paths diverged. And I began to learn how those differences are playing out in the present.

Vox Borders is a new international documentary series presented by lululemon, by Emmy-nominated videojournalist Johnny Harris. For this series, Johnny is producing six 10-15 minute documentaries about different borders stories from around the world.

Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has similar symptoms to the flu. They also spread in similar ways. So it's natural to want to compare the two. But Covid-19 is very different, in ways that make it much more dangerous. And understanding how is key to understanding why we have to take it so seriously.

The demonstrators demanded a boycott of French products and tried to march to the French embassy but were blocked by police.   

France is an important trading partner and a major aid provider for Bangladesh.   

Police estimated that about 50,000 people participated in the protest, but organizers said more than 100,000 people had gathered for the rally.

Officially it’s for medicinal use but the legal grey area means ‘ganja’ lovers are celebrating. Subscribe: https://ab.co/3yqPOZ5 

It’s the country which gave us the words ‘bong’ and ‘ganja’.

In Thailand, cannabis has been used for centuries in traditional medicine.

But when the US launched its ‘war on drugs’ in the 1970s, Thailand became a key partner, placing cannabis on the narcotics list and toughening penalties against it.

This June, the country took it off that list, meaning cannabis sellers and recreational users no longer risked jail for selling or possessing cannabis.

In tourist hotspots, a ‘ganja-culture’ is fast taking hold. In Bangkok’s Khao San Road nightspot, it seems easier to buy a joint than a Pad Thai.

‘Now it’s legal – God gave a gift for us’, says Choco Gonzales, a cannabis seller in Bangkok. 

And it’s party time for tourists at the famous full moon party at Koh Phangan in the country’s southeast.

‘Wherever you go now, it’s Amsterdam again in Asia’, says an Italian tourist at the party. 

As Australia reignites on its own debate about legalising cannabis, Southeast Asia correspondent Mazoe Ford travels around Thailand to meet the new crop of ‘ganja-preneurs’ cashing in on the green rush.

In Bangkok, Kitty Chopaka, a shop owner selling cannabis products and a leading advocate of decriminalisation, is still pinching herself. 

‘I never thought in my lifetime that this would actually happen…But at the same time I knew it has to be done.’

In the southern island of Samui, resort owner Carl Lamb reckons the liberalisation of the laws is attracting overseas tourists. 

‘You can really feel it's reinvigorated the market. There's a new energy here.’

Ford also hitches a ride on the private jet of the politician behind the policy – Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul.

He takes us to Thailand’s east to spruik the medicinal cannabis industry which the government hopes will become a billion-dollar industry.

‘It turned out that majority of my voters chose to vote for my party… some people even called my party (the) “Cannabis Party”’, he tells Ford.

But not everyone welcomes the change.  More than a thousand doctors have warned that the drug was delisted before proper safeguards and regulations were in place.

‘We don't want to be the cannabis haven of the world’, say Doctor Chanchai Sittipunt from Chulalongkorn University's Faculty of Medicine.
 
But Kitty Chopaka says going back isn’t possible - the genie is out of the bottle.

‘That bottle is broken. It’s gone!’

The video conferencing session between the two schools was conducted between students of Gyan Mandir Public School (Delhi, India) and Adamjee Model School (Karachi, Pakistan). The session was coordinated by Ms Anju Anand and Ms Devika Mittal from Indian side and Mr Usama Palla and Ms Suraya Islam from Pakistan. We're grateful they let us drop by!

The British tasked Cyril Radcliffe with the job of drawing a line to separate Punjab and Bengal provinces from India into East and West Pakistan. Muslims and Hindus weren’t the only ones being separated from each other. Sikhs and people from other faiths were affected as well. 

A Sikh pilgrimage was divided because of the new border, Punjabi people of all faiths were separated from each other, and a culture was ultimately divided.

This Vox Borders episode looks at how the Radcliffe line changed Punjab and how communities are affected now.

198,LVWTQcZbLgY,Vox,The sound illusion that makes Dunkirk so intense,2017-07-26T12:00:23Z,25,"Why Christopher Nolan is obsessed with Shepard tones.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk is a nerve-wracking movie. Three separate storylines tell the tale of the famed World War II evacuation in a intense two hours of film. A lot of that feeling has to do with how the film's score uses Shepard tones — layered sound waves that simulate a constant ascent in tone — to create a sensation of building tension. They're a personal favorite trick of Nolan's: he's based sound effects and entire soundtracks with other composers on the auditory illusion. In Dunkirk, composer Hans Zimmer crafted his soundtrack around the effect — and it's an auditory masterpiece.

109,Y5yCbi4qcpk,BBC News,Taliban seize power in Afghanistan as President flees country - BBC News,2021-08-15T21:30:16Z,25,"The Taliban have taken control of Afghanistan, occupying the capital Kabul after President Ashraf Ghani fled the country.

Taliban forces occupied the Presidential Palace, from where they are preparing to announce that they are the new rulers of an “Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan”. 

It’s the culmination of a lightning takeover by the Islamist fighters, following the decision by the United States and other coalition nations to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan.   

Coalition troops first entered the country in 2001 following the 9/11 attacks and removed the Taliban from power.   20 years of fighting to support the new Afghan government cost thousands of lives. 

The decision of the US President Joe Biden to withdraw all US forces by September paved the way for the final Taliban offensive that overwhelmed the Afghan government's forces.

Foreign nationals and many Afghans have been trying to get on flights out of Kabul airport, where US and British troops have been deployed to aid the evacuation. 

Mishal Husain presents BBC News at Ten reporting by diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams, Malik Mudassir in Kabul, political correspondent Ben Wright and north America editor Jon Sopel.

ITV News Senior International Correspondent John Irvine and his team, Mike Field, Lutfi Abu-Aun, Martin Flynn and Andriy Glushko, were given exclusive access to a Ukrainian artillery unit on the frontline of the war, as it targets Russian forces near the Ukrainian city of Izyum.

Every ferocious bellow from the Ukrainian army howitzer was an attack on the Russians and an assault on the senses of the gun crew and those of us watching them work.

The muzzle flash, the roar, the earth shaking and the dust – all of it happened in a split second. Then, after a slick reload, the gun fired in anger once more.

We were with an artillery unit on the eastern front. These days you can’t get much closer to the war than this.

Street fights on this vast agricultural landscape are few and far between. Here the war has evolved into an artillery battle.

The final flight of wingsuit diver Victor Kovats has been shown on Chinese state television.

State news agency Xinhau reported around 200 firefighters and police officers were involved in the search for his body. Initial investigations said the cause of Kovats' accident may have been a ""technical problem during the trial."" Kovats was an experienced wingsuit flyer having completed 700 flights and 125 skydives since taking up the sport 6 years ago. He was due to take part in the second World Wingsuit Championship this week in Tianmen mountain where participants have to jump from 700-metre-high cliffs. Report by Ashley Fudge.

As expected though, Brexit and a future trade deal took centre stage in the bilaterals.

The G7 brings together leaders from the UK, USA, Canada, Germany, Italy, France and Japan for an annual discussion.

Meet Tetyana Chornovol, a former nationalist member of parliament, who has swapped anti-corruption campaigning to be an anti-tank missile operator in the frontline trenches.

Chornovol said: ""I switched it on and saw tanks on the screen. They just entered within the range of my missile. I took aim and destroyed the first tank. Interestingly, the rocket was flying for quite some time.

Perhaps the tanks registered the rocket's launch and managed to turn back but I shot it right at the fuel tanks and the ammunition load has detonated.""

Lebanon’s internal security chief Abbas Ibrahim said the blast happened in a section that housed highly-explosive materials. Crystal Goomansingh reports.

According to Reuters, at least 10 people have been found dead following the explosion. The Lebanese Red Cross said hundreds of people were also taken to hospitals for treatment, but many remain trapped in homes damaged by the explosion.

The deadly explosion comes at a time when Lebanon is experiencing its worst economic and financial crisis in decades.

It also comes amid rising tensions between Israel and the militant Hezbollah group along Lebanon’s southern border.

Israel's Prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, warned Palestinian militants that this was just the beginning, threatening to strike with “blows they haven't dreamed of”.  

The United States is sending a senior diplomat to the Middle East to urge Israelis and Palestinians to end the violence. 

At least 65 Palestinians including 15 children and six Israelis are reported to have been killed since the fighting began.

In the past few days Palestinian militants have fired barrages of rockets  into Israel, many aimed at Tel Aviv. Israel has carried out a heavy bombardment of Gaza launching hundreds of air strikes. 

Tensions have been growing in Jerusalem, partly due to a long-running threat to evict Palestinians from their homes in occupied East Jerusalem in an area claimed by Jewish settlers. 

Sophie Raworth presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Tom Bateman in Jerusalem, Rushdi Abualouf in Gaza and Caroline Hawley.

China’s state media have portrayed the meetings as cordial and well-planned, highlighting how the talks have emphasized both sides’ shared strategic interests and the North’s commitment to denuclearize.

723,pd8P12BXebo,The New York Times,Dying in the Name of Vaccine Freedom | NYT Opinion,2021-08-23T17:00:32Z,25,"In the video above, Alexander Stockton, a producer on the Opinion Video team, explores two of the main reasons the number of Covid cases is soaring once again in the United States: vaccine hesitancy and refusal.

“It’s hard to watch the pandemic drag on as Americans refuse the vaccine in the name of freedom,” he says.

Seeking understanding, Mr. Stockton travels to Mountain Home, Ark., in the Ozarks, a region with galloping contagion and — not unrelated — abysmal vaccination rates.

He finds that a range of feelings and beliefs underpins the low rates — including fear, skepticism and a libertarian strain of defiance.

This doubt even extends to the staff at a regional hospital, where about half of the medical personnel are not vaccinated — even while the intensive care unit is crowded with unvaccinated Covid patients fighting for their lives.

Mountain Home — like the United States as a whole — is caught in a tug of war between private liberty and public health. But Mr. Stockton suggests that unless government upholds its duty to protect Americans, keeping the common good in mind, this may be a battle with no end.

Few know the extreme nature of the beliefs of the Jehovah's Witnesses, a religious group which boasts eight million followers in multiple nations.
 
They take a strict interpretation of the Bible and predicted the world would meet its ‘wicked end’ in 1914, 1925 and 1975.
 
A US-based Governing Body of eight men sits at the pinnacle of the Jehovah’s Witnesses organisation. Witnesses believe these men are anointed as the voice of God on Earth. 
 
Former members reveal the secretive practices used to instil fear and maintain discipline among followers.
 
With strict rules governing every aspect of their lives, these former Witnesses say the organisation is controlling and dangerous.
 
They say it's time to hold the Jehovah's Witnesses to account.

At just three-years-old, James -- known as “Baby James” -- is the pint-sized pride of southern Louisiana for his skills on the golf course.

“He would start hitting the ball around the house while he was crawling,” James’ mother Nicole Grimes told ABC News’ “Nightline.” “We’d just moved here and he started crawling it, hitting it.”

A self-described “golf mom,” Nicole Grimes drives James to practice at two nearby golf courses at least four times a week.

1613,G38ZC8nh_wk,Daily Mail,Royal family seen gathered in 1984 for Prince Harry's christening,2018-05-22T11:28:52Z,22,"It was the historic room that set the backdrop for the official wedding photographs of Prince Harry and Meghan after their stunning wedding ceremony on Saturday. But it was not the first time Windsor Castle's Green Drawing Room has played a part in history. The grand reception room - one of three in the sprawling estate - was painstakingly renovated back to its former glory after a devastating fire in 1992. Adorable footage obtained by MailOnline shows the Royal family celebrating Prince Harry's christening in the room, back in 1984. In the film, the Queen Mother cradles baby Harry while Prince William runs rings around other members of the family in a playful display until he is scooped up by his father Prince Charles.

2109,qLidxfL8q1Q,ABC News In-depth,"Saudis have been Abandoning their Kids Abroad, Now the Children want Answers | Foreign Correspondent",2022-05-19T10:00:14Z,25,"A troubled man. His missing father. A secretive Kingdom, faraway. American Jared Morrison has dreamed of meeting his dad since he was a kid.
Subscribe: https://ab.co/3yqPOZ5
Like many young Saudi men, Jared’s father came to America to study in the 1970s. At university, he met Jared’s mum and they began a relationship. When she became pregnant, he disappeared back home.

Throughout his childhood and into adulthood, Jared was obsessed with finding his Saudi father.

“I had that overwhelming urge and drive...to find him, locate him, learn about him, learn about the culture. It was just an innate instinct.”

Jared connected once on the phone when he was in his early twenties but his father rejected him. Now that Saudi Arabia has begun to open up to the world, Jared wants to try again.
 
Reporter Brietta Hague and Saudi producer Essam Al-Ghalib tell the exclusive story of Jared as he travels to the Kingdom to try and track down his father. It’s a dangerous, fraught and emotionally risky mission. 

Jared's family is powerful and well-connected in Saudi and Jared bumps up against the unwritten rules of a deeply conservative society, which values reputation and family honour above all.

Jared is not alone in his quest to connect with his Saudi father. 

Saudi men abroad continue to father and abandon children. In Guatemala, we meet a young boy and his single mother, his Saudi father long since departed. Sami Alrajhi Chang visits the mosque every week to learn Arabic in the hope he may one day meet his Saudi family.

Sami’s father Sulaiman came to study in the USA as part of a Saudi government scholarship programme. There he met student Mandre Chang. Despite promising her marriage and a life together, he abandoned Mandre days after Sami’s birth. 

Mandre and Sami are part of a global network of people searching for answers. Stone-walled by the Saudi government and embassies, Mandre sought the help of a blog called ‘Saudi Children Left Behind’, a platform encouraging the children and ex-partners of Saudi men to publish their stories of abandonment in the hope they’ll make contact. 

'Saudi Children Left Behind' is an untold story about the powerful human impulse to connect with family, against all odds, and a rare insight into the rigid rules governing this hidden Kingdom – rules about kinship, obligation and family honour.

252,i-DibXXjW4g,Al Jazeera English,Algerian Wedding | Al Jazeera World,2014-06-25T13:00:37Z,25,"A rare glimpse at people's daily lives in western Algeria as we go behind the scenes at three different weddings.

Summer in Algeria - the largest Arab country in the world and the biggest in the African continent - is a popular time of year for traditional, elaborate weddings, particularly in the lead-up to Ramadan.

At the heart of these celebrations are the brides with their hand-made outfits, their jewellery and the henna parties; as well as the delicious food that accompanies every step of the marriage process. Plus the music and armed horsemen in tribal war dress.

This colourful film takes us through the rituals and significance of Algerian traditions by following three different wedding ceremonies.

We speak to heritage researchers about Algeria's marriage traditions and see how engagements and arrangements are formalised. This film is an intimate look at the preparations and rituals of these rich and sumptuous family celebrations.

1151,p0G68ORc8uQ,The Economist,The deep ocean is the final frontier on planet Earth,2017-03-23T12:03:53Z,28,"Watch the latest in the Ocean series - How to stop plastics getting into the ocean: https://youtu.be/D7EdgCxFZ8Q

The ocean covers 70% of our planet. The deep-sea floor is a realm that is largely unexplored, but cutting-edge technology is enabling a new generation of aquanauts to go deeper than ever before.

Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.trib.al/rWl91R7 

Beneath the waves is a mysterious world that takes up to 95% of Earth's living space. Only three people have ever reached the bottom of the deepest part of the ocean. The deep is a world without sunlight, of freezing temperatures, and immense pressure. It's remained largely unexplored until now.

Cutting-edge technology is enabling a new generation of aquanauts to explore deeper than ever before. They are opening up a whole new world of potential benefits to humanity. The risks are great, but the rewards could be greater. From a vast wealth of resources to clues about the origins of life, the race is on to the final frontier 

The Okeanos Explorer, the American government state-of-the-art vessel, designed for every type of deep ocean exploration from discovering new species to investigating shipwrecks. On board, engineers and scientists come together to answer questions about the origins of life and human history. 

Today the Okeanos is on a mission to investigate the wreck of a World War one submarine. Engineer Bobby Moore is part of a team who has developed the technology for this type of mission.  

The “deep discover”, a remote operating vehicle is equipped with 20 powerful LED lights and designed to withstand the huge pressure four miles down. Equivalent to 50 jumbo jets stacked on top of a person

While the crew of the Okeanos send robots to investigate the deep, some of their fellow scientists prefer a more hands-on approach. Doctor Greg stone is a world leading marine biologist with over 8,000 hours under the sea. He has been exploring the abyss in person for 30 years. 

The technology opening up the deep is also opening up opportunity. Not just to witness the diversity of life but to glimpse vast amounts of rare mineral resources. Some of the world's most valuable metals can be found deep under the waves. A discovery that has begun to pique the interest of the global mining industry.

The boldest of mining companies are heading to the deep drawn by the allure of a new Gold Rush. But to exploit it they're also beating a path to another strange new world. In an industrial estate in the north of England, SMD is one of the world's leading manufacturers of remote underwater equipment. The industrial technology the company has developed has made mining possible several kilometers beneath the ocean surface.  

With an estimated 150 trillion dollars’ worth of gold alone, deep-sea mining has the potential to transform the global economy. 

With so much still to discover, mining in the deep ocean could have unknowable impact. It's not just life today that may need protecting; reaching the deep ocean might just allow researchers to answer some truly fundamental questions. Hydrothermal vents, hot springs on the ocean floor, are cracks in the Earth's crust. Some claim they could help scientists glimpse the origins of life itself. 

We might still be years away from unlocking the mysteries of the deep. Even with the latest technology, this kind of exploration is always challenging.  As the crew of the Okeanos comes to terms with a scale of the challenge and the opportunity that lies beneath, what they and others discover could transform humanity's understanding of how to protect the ocean.

It's the most hostile environment on earth, but the keys to our future may lie in the deep.

Biden's victory in two states that were key parts of Mr. Trump's coalition in 2016 significantly limits the president's pathways to reelection.

CBS News still considers three states – North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Georgia – toss-ups, while Biden is likely to win in Arizona and Nevada. Biden is currently projected to win states that control 253 electoral votes, just 17 votes shy of the 270 needed to win the White House. A projected win in Arizona and Nevada would give him precisely 270 votes. The president's total currently stands at 213.",6098260.0,23462,1018,PT11H54M58S

The partially naked woman was then sent for a stroll down London's Kensington High Street to see how passers-by would react to her unusual outfit. Kelly's attire - or lack of - attracted far more attention than the spray-on jeans she sported for a similar test last month.

The population paid a high price in the dying days of World War 2, fuelling fears that they will once again become a target.

953,rrbJ2Y4xHWg,The Sun,Rotting dead Russian soldiers found in trenches as Putin continues slaughter in east Ukraine,2022-04-13T14:41:45Z,25,"The Sun's Defence Editor Jerome Starkey finds dead Russian soldiers rotting in trenches that have been made into shallow graves as Putin continues slaughter in the east of Ukraine.

DEAD Russian soldiers were left rotting in their bunkers on Tuesday as Ukraine’s troops overran their positions — but a deadly new onslaught by Putin’s forces is feared within days.

The Sun witnessed scenes of carnage following a major battle outside Kharkiv — even as Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to press on with his slaughter in the east.

Bodies lay slumped in blown-open dugouts after Ukraine seized control of a ridgeline in the three-day battle for Mala Rohan — where soldiers are confident they can defeat Russia.

One said: “Whatever Putin does, we won’t surrender. We have won the battle of Mala Rohan. We are one step closer to winning the war.”

But it comes amid rising fears Russia will unleash chemical weapons to turn the tide in its bloodbath invasion after many defeats.

Dozens of Russian troops in T-72 tanks had dug into a treeline two miles outside Kharkiv and bombarded Ukraine’s second city.

READ MORE: A severe cyclone is roaring in the Arabian Sea off southwestern India with winds of up to 140 kph (87 mph), causing heavy rains and flooding. 

Cyclone Tauktae, the season's first major storm, is expected to make landfall early Tuesday in Gujarat state, a statement by the India Meteorological Department said. 

The massive storm will likely hamper India's fight against a surge of the coronavirus that's sweeping the country with devastating deaths, and the virus lockdown measures may slow relief work and damage from the storm could potentially destroy roads and cut vital supply lines. 

In areas along the Arabian Sea coast, four people were killed and 73 villages badly damaged on Sunday, according to the southwestern Karnataka state's disaster management authority.

Subscribe to The Guardian on YouTube ► http://bit.ly/subscribegdn

But when a teen sexual assault committed by two members of the football team surfaced, the shadowy hacker group Anonymous caught wind of the story and decided to intervene. 

After publishing videos and social media from the night of the assault to their millions of online followers, they sparked viral outrage and demands for #JusticeforJaneDoe. 

They unleashed a passionate mob and their actions divided the small town, but in the process gave strength to generations of women forced to hide abuse. This film asks, when it seems like nothing will change, when is it OK for outsiders to intervene?

112,8A65JzDltY4,BBC News,Catastrophic flooding across western Europe as politicians blame climate change - BBC News,2021-07-16T21:17:28Z,25,"More than 120 people have died and hundreds are still missing after record rainfall caused the worst flooding in parts of Western Europe for many decades. 

In Germany dozens of people were unaccounted for, with the Chancellor Angela Merkel describing the floods as a catastrophe.

Torrential rain has also devastated parts of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. 

Survivors have described the terrifying speed at which water levels rose.
 
Some politicians in Germany say the extreme weather is the result of global warming and they're calling for more urgent action to counter climate change.

Clive Myrie presents BBC News at Ten reporting - from Jenny Hill in Erftstadt, Germany - Anna Holligan in the Dutch town of Valkenberg -  and chief environment correspondent Justin Rowlatt on the threat posed by climate change.

But where should journalists draw the line? And who pays the price when they take too many risks? In her Op-Doc, “From Journalist to Hostage,” director Sonia Kennebeck explores those questions at close range, through the story of a reporter who was held captive by Somali pirates for two and a half years. Many commentators have suggested that journalists like Michael Scott Moore have no business taking such risks — and shouldn’t expect sympathy or aid. But if reporters always steer clear of dangerous places, will important stories go untold?

Experts believe it suffered a catastophic implosion.*

Missing Titanic submarine: Five things that may have gone wrong. It is another mystery of the deep.
 
As hopes fade for the five wealthy Titanic tourists who vanished while exploring the wreck aboard a mini submarine – one question keeps being asked.
 
What happened?
 
It is possible that no one will ever know after the sub, called Titan, suddenly went silent hundreds of miles off the coast of Canada and around 13,000ft underwater beside the Titanic.
 
On board were five men including a British billionaire, one of Pakistan’s richest men and his son, a famed French explorer, and the CEO of the company running the dive.
 
But submarine experts agree that five possible accidents are the most likely cause.

255,866fXIAZsDk,Al Jazeera English,Piracy in Nigeria | People & Power,2016-11-17T11:06:25Z,24,"The event followed a now familiar pattern: a small convoy of dusty 4x4 vehicles drove on to the edge of the airstrip at Galkayo in Puntland, north-central Somalia; armed security guards took up watchful positions nearby and a number of bemused-looking men stepped gingerly from the cars and lined up to have their photographs taken by the media.

On this occasion there were 11 of them; all had been hostages until that morning. They were sailors from a Malaysian cargo vessel that had been hijacked by Somali pirates a few years ago and held until a ransom was paid for their release.

One of them gave a brief account of what had happened. ""On November 26, 2010 our ship was hijacked in the Indian Ocean. Their demand was 20 million. After that, they threatened the owner. You now increase money or we will shoot the crew. The owner didn't increase the money and then one Indian is shot with just three bullets. Then they hit us and tortured us. Tell your family to bring us money, otherwise we will kill you!""

The crew had been held for three and a half years but they were the fortunate ones. Five of their crew mates had died in that time. Now the survivors were going home and a UN plane with two envoys on board was flying in to see them to safety.

Such scenes have become relatively commonplace in Galkayo in recent times. Eighty percent of global trade is carried by sea and Somalia sits on a key maritime route linking Europe and Asia. More than 18,000 ships pass its shores every year. Over the past decade, Somali pirates, often former fishermen whose traditional livelihoods have been destroyed by foreign trawlers and toxic waste dumping, have attacked more than 300 vessels and kidnapped 700 people.

Faced with such a threat, the international community responded aggressively. In 2008, European states, the US and others began sending naval forces to these seas. They are still there today - warships, planes and helicopters patrolling thousands of square miles and doing a fair job of keeping the hijackers at bay. The UN and others have also played an increasing role in facilitating negotiations for the release of hostages - such as those set free at places such as Galkayo - for whose liberty large ransoms have been paid.

But if the problem is now slowly coming under control in Somalia, the same cannot be said for other parts of the world where piracy is on the increase. Lawlessness, desperation, poverty, greed and even political radicalism have brought the phenomenon to the waters of South America, Asia and, perhaps most aggressively, to West Africa.  

In an effort to understand the reasons why, Bertrand Monnet, a French academic and filmmaker, has been travelling to piracy hot spots around the coast of Africa. In an extraordinary and very tense series of encounters, he came to face to face with heavily armed pirate gangs operating in and around the Niger Delta, where Nigeria's huge offshore oil industry, which employs thousands of expatriates, offers rich ransom pickings. It gradually became clear that piracy in West Africa has many of the same root causes as piracy in Somalia and elsewhere, not least of which is that those who don't share in the benefits and profits of global trade have ever fewer reasons these days to respect the security of those who do.

“This is a spot where the Russians tried to break through on a ringroad yesterday, they were ambushed by the Ukrainians,” said Roland Oliphant, The Telegraph's senior foreign correspondent.

“The situation is this: as far as we understand the Russians have stopped on the northern side of the city. They don’t seem to be doing much for now but they’re lobbing shells in towards the Ukrainians and into the northern suburbs. 

“Our suspicion is they’re going to try and decapitate Kyiv so they don’t have to fight here.”

Our journalism reveals the deeply-held safety concerns of current and former Boeing engineers, who in some cases fear to fly on the 787, the plane they build.

We uncover allegations of on-the-job drug use, quality control problems and poor workmanship.
 
We explore the roots of the battery problems that led to the plane’s grounding due to safety concerns for three months from January 2013.

'You'll never get your head around how big the universe is,' warns astronomer Pete Edwards of the University of Durham in this film about measuring astronomical distances. 

'There are as many stars in the universe as there are grains of sand on the Earth.' So how far is a light year? And supposing our galaxy were the size of a grain of sand, how big would the universe be?

1510,adccBN1y3E0,Washington Post,"She gets paid to be her paralyzed boyfriend’s caregiver, but marriage could change that",2021-08-09T15:49:12Z,25,"Over a year ago Jane Morgan and Conner Slevin's life changed when Conner was hit by a wave in the ocean on a trip to Mexico. It left him paralyzed. Now, his girlfriend Jane is his sole caregiver, taking care of his long list of medical needs. Living in Oregon, the state pays Jane minimum wage for forty hours of care a week. Before the accident, Conner was planning to propose. But if they marry, Jane's payments for caregiving will get reduced. 

Who gets paid to be a caregiver is complicated. Medicaid, Medicare and private insurance companies have different rules and requirements for paying family members, as do individual states — and in most states, married caregivers are not counted as workers. Only eight state Medicaid programs allow married people to be paid caregivers to their partners. Eight additional states have private programs that allow spouses to be paid as caregivers.

But across much of the country, interabled couples, a relationship with one person who is disabled and one who is able-bodied, are placed in a terrible predicament: marriage or compensation for the grueling work of managing one of the most expensive medical conditions.

1066,u4qadz-es0E,The Guardian,'I will never be cut': Kenyan girls fight back against genital mutilation | Guardian Investigations,2011-04-18T09:59:14Z,25,"Female genital mutilation (FGM) horrifies – and bewilders – westerners who find it incomprehensible that a mother would allow her daughter to be so brutally amputated with all the risks of infection, difficult childbirth and deprivation of sexual pleasure. But when women in rural Kenya refuse genital mutilation, the social costs are high.

Nancy and Gertrude are Kenyan girls about to face this brutal passage to womanhood. What this film does is to show how custom – even when violent and dangerous – embeds itself in social expectations. These girls are not considered eligible by prospective husbands until they have been cut; their parents need the income from a dowry to shore up precarious family finances. Standing out against such powerful conventions is difficult, dangerous, and costs money.

Directed, produced and filmed by Sara Nason. Narrated by Angela Griffin. This video is one of a series of investigative documentaries about poverty, commissioned and editorially controlled by Guardian Films, produced in association with Christian Aid.

(Subscribe: https://bit.ly/C4_News_Subscribe)

Despite Moscow's claim to be striking at military targets, residential areas of many cities have come under sustained attack, while key infrastructure including power plants, bridges and a dam supplying fresh water to Crimea have been hit.  

Ukraine said at least 198 people have so far been killed, including three children. 

There's now a round-the-clock curfew in place in Kyiv, its capture is Russia's primary military objective. 

In the capital, and in cities across the country like Kharkiv, the Ukrainian military seems to be holding out against Russian advances. 

But many sources are saying that the southern city of Melitopol has fallen. 

Tens of thousands of civilians have fled, heading for neighbouring countries in the west. 

Our chief correspondent Alex Thomson reports.

Actors, filmmakers and more have reacted to Oscar-winner Will Smith hitting Chris Rock at the 94th Academy Awards on Sunday. Smith took offence at a joke that Rock made about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, and her alopecia medical condition.

Some stars, including Pose's Michaela Jaé Rodriguez, threw their support behind last night's crowned Best Actor winner, while others were quick to condem Smith's violent response.

Watch to see how much the moment has divided opinion.

We take you behind the scenes of this billion-dollar industry where the problems can begin from the moment of death with an unseemly tug of war over who gets the contract to take a body.

Dying is an expensive business but as this investigation reveals, what you pay for is not necessarily an indication of the service received.

The program uncovers cases where families have been left out of pocket and deeply distressed, and how operators are getting away with this behaviour in an industry that is virtually unregulated.

1511,ibWJO02nNsY,Washington Post,Inside the U.S. Capitol at the height of the siege | Visual Forensics,2021-01-17T01:45:03Z,25,"At 2:12 p.m. on Jan. 6, supporters of President Trump began climbing through a window they had smashed on the northwest side of the U.S. Capitol. “Go! Go! Go!” someone shouted as the rioters, some in military gear, streamed in. It was the start of the most serious attack on the Capitol since the War of 1812. The mob coursed through the building, enraged that Congress was preparing to make Trump’s electoral defeat official. “Drag them out! … Hang them out!” rioters yelled at one point, as they gathered near the House chamber.

Officials in the House and Senate secured the doors of their respective chambers, but lawmakers were soon forced to retreat to undisclosed locations. Five people died on the grounds that day, including a Capitol police officer. In all, more than 50 officers were injured.

To reconstruct the pandemonium inside the Capitol, The Washington Post examined text messages, photos and hundreds of videos, some of which were exclusively obtained. By synchronizing the footage and locating some of the camera angles within a digital 3-D model of the building, The Post was able to map the rioters’ movements and assess how close they came to lawmakers — in some cases feet apart or separated only by a handful of vastly outnumbered police officers.

2114,bB3kuuBPVys,ABC News In-depth,The Environmental Disaster that is Fuelled by Used Clothes and Fast Fashion | Foreign Correspondent,2021-08-12T10:00:13Z,25,"The dark side of the world’s fashion addiction. Many of our old clothes, donated
to charities, end up in rotting textile mountains in West Africa. This is a story
about how our waste is creating an environmental disaster.

Have you ever thought about what happens to your old clothes after you drop them off at the
op shop? It might be time to start, because these goodwill gestures are helping to fuel an environmental catastrophe on the other side of the world.

When charities in Australia can’t sell donated clothing, tonnes of it ends up being exported to
countries like Ghana, in West Africa. Ship after ship docks every week with bales from Europe,
the US, China and Australia.

They call them ‘Dead White Man’s Clothes’. Once they arrive in Ghana, they’re taken to the
bustling Kantamanto markets in the capital Accra and from here, they make their way to
villages and towns across the country.

The industry provides jobs for thousands of people, like Asare Asamoah, a successful importer.
He brings in clothes, mainly from the United Kingdom, and if they’re good quality, he can make
a decent living.

But it’s risky business. He has to pay upfront for a bale and never knows whether it’s trash or
treasure. With cheap, fast fashion flooding the world, the quality of the clothes arriving in
Ghana is getting worse and worse.

‘Sometimes you’ve gone and bought something, then you don’t get what you want’, says
Asamoah. ‘Then you lose your money.”

And there’s a dark side to this industry.

Correspondent Linton Besser travels to Ghana to uncover the dirty secret behind the world’s
fashion addiction.

While 60 per cent of imported fashion items are reused and resold, 40 per cent are rubbish,
creating an environmental catastrophe for this poor nation.

With the main dumpsite for textile waste now full, unregulated dumpsites ring the city. These
fetid clothes mountains are often set on fire, filling the skies with acrid smoke.

‘It is totally a disservice to us in this part of the world because we have become sort of the
dumping ground for the textile waste that is produced from Europe, from the Americas”, says
Accra’s waste manager, Solomon Noi.

Emmanuel Ajaab imports used clothes from Australia but he despairs at the poor quality of the
clothes that arrive. From a bale of about 200 garments, he finds only seven he can resell at a
good price.

“In Europe and UK and Australia, America, they think Africa here, sorry to say, we are not like a
human being”, he tells Foreign Correspondent.

The dumped textiles also get swept up in the monsoonal rains and end up choking the city’s
waterways and beaches, posing a danger to fishermen and aquatic life. Liz Ricketts, who runs
an NGO campaigning for awareness of Ghana's textile waste crisis, lays the blame at the feet
of international fashion houses.

“Waste is a part of the business model of fashion. A lot of brands overproduce by up to 40 per
cent”, says Ricketts.

Noi begs the people who donate their clothes to think twice about where they end up.

“If they come here, like you've come, and you see the practicality for yourself, then they will
know that, no, we better take care of these things within our country and not to ship that
problem to cause problems to other people.”

Results from the 2020 presidential election as Americans vote in races for the presidency, 11 governorships, 35 Senate seats and all 435 House seats.

Final polls show the race between President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden has tightened since mid-October, both nationally and in battleground states.

Biden's lead in USA TODAY's average of averages, which is based on data from RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight, reached double-digits on Oct. 12, but has since fallen back to a 7.5-percentage point lead. That leaves him back roughly in the same position USA TODAY found him in its first poll roundup on Sept. 28, when his polling average lead over Trump was 7.2 points. 

Beyond the presidency, Tuesday's election may result in changes in Congress, where Democrats want to regain control of the Republican-led Senate and Democrats hope to expand their advantage in the House.

Here’s Part 2 of our hilarious collection of epic awkward moments throughout his career in politics.

With just weeks to go until the US election in November, Joe Biden's gaffes are still making headlines. He recently struggled to describe the impact of coronavirus at a rally in Pittsburgh, saying: “COVID has taken this year just since the outbreak, has taken more than 100 years – look, here's the lives it's just it's just, I mean, think about it"".

But with Joe Biden defending a steady lead in the polls against President Donald Trump, will his gaffes get in the way of his bid for the White House?

731,mw9UXsnWWUI,The New York Times,What Do Europeans Think About American Life? | NYT Opinion,2019-10-28T17:00:08Z,25,"We asked young, ordinary Europeans to take a look at U.S. policies on everything from food to guns. As they discover facts about America, they’re not impressed.

Sometimes it’s useful to get an outside perspective. In the Video Op-Ed above, Europeans are shocked to learn that the American government does not guarantee social protections that citizens in other advanced economies take for granted. 

Their reactions reflect how European governments prioritize citizen welfare, offering national assurances like universal health care and affordable education. Americans have grown accustomed to the exorbitant costs of basic human services, the absence of parental leave protection and the unregulated presence of chemicals in food — things that would “cause riots” in Europe. 

It’s true that the United States grapples with a larger and more diverse population than that of any European country. But with the resources of the world’s largest economy and as keepers of the American dream, can’t policymakers find solutions?

2116,0rSCndxoZ4U,ABC News In-depth,Investigating the Dangerous New Mafia taking control in Italy | Foreign Correspondent,2020-03-17T09:00:11Z,25,"“When you enter the organization, you cannot get out other than by death.”

The mafia is one of Italy’s most famous international business brands, with an estimated annual turnover of $250 billion a year. But its market share is being challenged by a group of ruthless new players.

Foreign Correspondent’s Emma Alberici investigates the growing power of Nigerian organised crime in the birthplace of the Italian mafia.

The director of Italy’s anti-mafia agency says Nigerian crime gangs are organised and dangerous:
“It has many similar traits to Italian mafia – its oaths, its sense of belonging, the capacity to coerce, the code of silence…even the local mafia fear them.”

Specialists in trafficking humans for sexual slavery and drug running, the Nigerians are now being allowed to run their operations in return for giving the Italian mafia a cut. 

A former prostitute, trafficked from Nigeria, tells us:
‘There’s no pity. If you misbehave…or you can’t continue anymore, they will bring their gun and shoot you.’ 

We investigate the two main hubs for Nigerian organised crime in Italy. 
North of Naples, Alberici visits Castel Volturno, an almost lawless coastal town, abandoned by the local Camorra Mafia and by the state. Here, the Nigerian Mafia is left alone to use this once “Mafioso Riviera” as a hub for its European operations.

In Sicily, the mafia’s birthplace, we go undercover to expose prostitution and drug houses and catch up with the man named by investigators as one of the Nigerian Mafia’s kingpins.

At a secret location, we speak to Roberto Saviano, one of the world’s most famous Mafia whistle-blowers. He lost his freedom 13 years ago after revealing the sordid workings of the Camorra mafia in Naples. 

Now living under permanent police guard, Saviano explains the role Nigerian organised crime plays in Italy’s homegrown mafia. 

To stay silent, he says, is to be complicit.

The visual was inadvertently used in a segment that discusses how some stolen vehicles from Canada are being resold overseas. That visual has since been removed. Banix Motors have indicated that they have never been associated with the sale of stolen vehicles from Canada and CBC never intended to associate Banix Motors with our investigation.

Cars stolen from driveways and shopping malls in Canada are ending up overseas. Some of the most-stolen vehicles include the Honda CR-V, Toyota Highlander, Lexus RX and Ford F-150. Marketplace has found stolen Canadian vehicles in West Africa. Highly organized criminal gangs are using the proceeds to fund and commit other crimes. We show how quick and easy it is for thieves to make off with vehicles using inexpensive tools that are readily available and ask why carmakers aren’t doing more to enhance security.

Ukrainian Air Force spokesman, Colonel Yuri Ignat, told to Reuters on Saturday (March 26) the country's pilots had trained for years and conducted joint exercises with U.S. pilots precisely because ""we understood that there could be such a scenario"". Ukraine now needs fighter jets such as American F-15s and F-16s to supplement Ukraine's ageing Soviet-era MiG-29s and Sukhoi planes, he said, in order to overcome Russia's numerical and technological superiority in the air.

""We are fighting with the equipment of the '70s and '80s, they are fighting with the equipment of 2010 and later,"" Ignat said.

""We would be grateful for the Soviet-made equipment offered to us by the countries of Central Europe which still have it. But it will not be enough,"" he said, referring to the offer by neighbouring Poland earlier this month to transfer its Russian-made MiG-29 fighter jets to a U.S. base in Germany as a way to replenish Ukraine's air force in its defence against invading Russian forces.

The United States rejected the offer by Poland.

“Give Ukraine weapons, you don't have to fight for us. We don't ask to close the sky anymore. Give us weapons, we will defend ourselves,” Ignat said.

A Ukrainian fighter pilot, known by his Air Force call sign “Juice”, spoke to Reuters from the cockpit of his plane.

“We are taught that we need to be very creative. We need to be tactically flexible,” he said.

“This jet is very capable. It's very manoeuvrable. And everyone just love loves it. But unfortunately, now it's not - it is absolutely not - effective against Russian jets, Russian fighter jets,” he said.

“The main problem for us is not the tactics. It's just zero equipment…the problem is technology,” he added.

Missile attacks have been a feature of Russia's invasion. The bombardment has hit military targets as well as residential areas, schools and hospitals in Ukrainian cities including Kharkiv and the besieged port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov. Moscow denies it is targeting civilians.

Russia says the operation was necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia while Russian speakers were being persecuted in Ukraine.

In the Apgujeong district of Seoul, the streets are lined with endless rows of plastic surgery clinics. Business is booming. In South Korea, v-shaped jaws, double eyelids and dimpled smiles are all the rage and people from across the nation, and the world, are flocking to the clinics for plastic surgery, supporting an industry worth $5bn a year.

More than 4,000 clinics provide cosmetic surgery in Seoul, with an estimated 650,000 people a year going under the knife.

But the surgeries performed by some of the clinics do not always live up to patients' expectations and the quest for beauty and profits is putting lives at risk.

So Yi Yoon has suffered many medical problems since having plastic surgery, including not being able to close one of her eyes. She now works two jobs to pay off her debts and is suffering from depression.

On this edition of 101 East, we look at what is driving the growth of this booming business and at what price to individuals and the wider Korean society?

101 East delves into Korea's plastic surgery craze and uncovers the real price of pursuing physical perfection.

2117,SORthIsoLP0,ABC News In-depth,Living Lonely and Loveless in Japan | Foreign Correspondent,2022-02-17T09:00:12Z,25,"Around the world more and more people are opting for the single life but in Japan, loneliness has become an epidemic.   Subscribe: https://ab.co/3yqPOZ5
Marriage and childbirth rates are falling, as more and more young Japanese choose to stay single and childless. Relationships are too difficult, they say.

In the country’s last Fertility Survey, figures showed that a quarter of women in their 30s were single, and half of those weren’t interested in having a relationship. 

Many Japanese adults aren’t even having sex. It’s estimated around 10% of people in their 30s are still virgins.
 
By 2040, it’s estimated nearly half of Japan’s population will be single.
Correspondent Jake Sturmer has reported from the ABC’s Tokyo bureau for 4 years and nothing has confounded him more than this social crisis.
As he prepares to return to Australia, Jake sets out on a final journey to discover the forces driving this ‘Solo Society’.

He meets 29-year-old Sayaka, who works in the fashion industry. Sayaka is happily single, and not interested in getting married. 

“I’m under a lot of (social) pressure but I don’t mind,” she says. “There's nothing I can’t do without a man at the moment.”

Instead, the objects of her affection are her dogs - Kogemaru, Unimaru, Rinmaru and Riko - whom she loves to spoil.

Naoya, a 32-year-old creative director for an advertising company, isn’t in a rush to get married either. He often feels lonely but hanging out with friends cheers him up.

“It’s fun drinking with my friends like this and I’m able to fill in the loneliness,” Naoya tells Jake in a cosy bar in downtown Tokyo.

Jake also explores a darker side of Japanese society, meeting a man who has opted out in an extreme way, hiding in his bedroom and avoiding society altogether. He’s what’s called a hikikomori, someone who withdrawn socially. 

In Japan there are more than a million hikikomori. Jake meets the mother of one who’s become an activist, campaigning for Japanese society to be more tolerant of those who don’t fit the mould.

“People believe they need to change the people who’ve withdrawn but I think it’s exactly the opposite. I think the society should change,” she says.

Jake spends time with Masatomi, a cleaner whose job is to clear out the homes of those who die alone. Each year, tens of thousands of Japanese end their lives alone, their bodies often found after neighbours detect an odour. Masatomi is calling for Japanese people to sit up and take notice.

“It’s something that could happen to anybody including myself. I strongly feel that we need to have connections with other people. I feel outrage, why don’t they see what’s going on?""

113,QHZzk66szvM,BBC News,Frontline report:  Ukrainian counterattack drives back Russians in north - BBC News,2022-05-11T21:40:27Z,25,"Ukrainian forces have successfully counterattacked against Russian troops, north of the country’s second largest city, Kharkiv.

They’ve retaken towns and villages, pushing Russian infantry and artillery back towards the border. 

The fighting has been slow and costly but Ukrainian forces say they have gained the upper hand. 

Kharkiv is just 35 miles from the Russian border.   The Ukrainian military success could threaten the Russian aim of capturing large areas of territory in the east of the country. 

Clive Myrie in Kyiv presents a BBC News at Ten special report from Quentin Sommerville and Darren Conway on the frontline north of Kharkiv.

In US news, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, one of the many 2020 election candidates, appeared at a Fox News Channel town hall and the Fox News audience loved him. At the end of the Pete Buttigieg Fox News town hall, the audience gave him a stand ovation. One might argue that the Pete Buttigieg town hall on Fox News went better than Bernie Sanders'. In the Pete Buttigieg interview he answered questions about the electoral college and called out Laura Ingraham and Tucker Carlson. After the town hall, the Fox & Friends hosts and President Trump expressed their dismay at Buttigieg's warm reception.

753,gDu9kVy17Vw,DW News,Vast 65 km Russian military convoy advances towards Kyiv | DW News,2022-03-01T07:47:07Z,25,"A massive Russian military convoy consisting of hundreds of tanks, trucks, towed artillery pieces and support vehicles has been pictured slowly making its way toward Kyiv. Satellite images provided by the US company Maxar Technologies show the convoy spanning a distance of about 40 miles (65 kilometers). The Ukrainian news agency UNIAN also reported the same length early on Tuesday. The convoy, which is longer than previously thought, is inching slowly toward the outskirts of the Ukrainian capital. Up until now, Ukrainian forces have managed to slow the Russian invasion, but it is unclear just how long they will be to fend off the Russian push for the capital.

More than 70 Ukrainian troops were killed when Russian troops shelled a military base in the town of Okhtyrka, regional governor Dmytro Zhyvytskyy said on Facebook. Okhtyrka is located in Ukraine's northeastern Sumy region, which borders Russia.

UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has confirmed the deaths of 102 civilians, including seven children, since the Russian invasion began on Thursday. Hundreds more had been injured, and the figures provided were likely to be undercounted.  Residents of Kyiv who have remained in the city have hunkered down in the subway stations.


Russia and Ukraine broke off peace talks Monday, which were held on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border. A follow-on round will take place in the coming days. Ukraine had demanded an immediate Russian cease-fire and troop withdrawal as its delegation arrived in Belarus for talks with Russian negotiators.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a formal request for his country to join the European Union as EU leaders said they might discuss the possibility of Ukraine joining the 27-nation bloc at an informal summit in March.
The UN said that more than 500,000 people had fled the country and were seeking safety in neighboring countries.
The US ordered 12 members of Russia's diplomatic mission to the United Nations in New York to be expelled, mandating their departures by March 7, said Russia's ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya.
Sanctions have taken a toll on Russia's economy, with the Central Bank announcing that it will raise its key interest rate to an unprecedented 20%, up from 9.5%, in the face of new sanctions following the invasion of Ukraine. 
The Russian ruble plunged almost 30% against the dollar.
On Monday, hundreds of anti-war protesters were arrested in both Russia and Belarus, according to human rights watchdogs.

Pegasus is manufactured by an Israeli technology company called the NSO Group and is among the most advanced spyware in the world. It can access and infiltrate a smartphone without the owner clicking a link, opening an email or even answering their phone - meaning it can go undetected.

This investigation exposes how Pegasus works, how governments like Saudi Arabia and the UAE have bought the hugely expensive spyware and how it has been used beyond the stated intentions of the NSO Group of “developing technology to prevent and investigate terror and crime” - including to target journalists.",4139136.0,44169.0,5643.0,PT47M7S

Those spare ingredients go into crafting this downbeat but memorable moment from “Joker.”

When the scene begins, Arthur Fleck (a.k.a. the Joker, played by Joaquin Phoenix) has just had an intense, life-defining moment and finds a bathroom to collect and calm himself. He does so with a dance that the director Todd Phillips said Phoenix came up with on the day of the shoot. In his narration, Phillips discusses the music (by Hildur Gudnadottir), and how he and Phoenix came to change the scene from what was in the script.

The announcement came as Nato and other Western allies met at a US air base in Germany to consider how to help Ukraine defend itself against the Russian invasion.

The United States said Russia would eventually be defeated and promised to support Ukraine “for the long haul”.

Meanwhile the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres held talks in Moscow with President Putin.  He said that the war was a violation of the integrity of Ukraine's territory and against the UN charter.

The Russian leader said he hoped  for a diplomatic solution to the conflict and denied Russian involvement in atrocities against civilians.

1154,JiYVoHEV5hs,The Economist,Why is chicken so cheap?,2019-03-28T17:51:44Z,25,"People eat 65 billion chickens every year. It is the fastest-growing meat product. Yet pound for pound the price of chicken has fallen sharply. How has this happened?

Read more about Chickenomics here: https://econ.st/2Wtp04o
Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy 

Chickens are the most populous bird on the planet. There are 23 billion of them at any given time - that's ten times more than any other bird.  It's by far the fastest growing meat product but pound for pound the price of chicken has fallen sharply. How has this happened? 

This farm is at the forefront of a technology revolution that has drastically changed chicken farming. It's run by David Speller who's pioneered the use of CCTV and CO2 monitors in chicken sheds. Along with his own farm, he works as a consultant overseeing the raising of around 3 million chickens in the UK. 

Chickens were first domesticated over 8,000 years ago but it wasn't until the 1940s that major efforts were made to create a super breed. The chicken of tomorrow competition in America would change chickens forever.

Today the lifecycle of broilers, chickens that are bred purely for their meat, is entirely preordained. They grow faster and bigger than ever before and they can only live supported by human technology. Chickens have changed so quickly they are now four times the size they were in the 1950s. 

A barnyard chicken can live up to 10 years showing the huge evolutionary change the broilers have undergone. But selective breeding on a global scale comes at a cost. If the chickens live beyond their planned life they develop huge medical problems. And there are concerns the chicken industry is relying on an increasingly small gene pool. 

Keeping chickens in battery cages was banned in the EU in 2012 but some people want to create better lives for broiler chickens. Free-range birds have more access to open air runs, while organic chickens are typically free from antibiotics, hormones and other synthetic chemicals. Organic chickens get to live the longest - 81 days compared to intensively reared birds which live between 35 and 40 days. Free-range chickens get the most access to open air runs but when it comes to living space, organic and free-range fair far better than intensively reared birds where as many as 17 adult birds live in a single square metre.

Organic farming might offer animals a greater quality of life but consumers are largely driven by cost and in an average UK supermarket, an intensively reared chicken cost several times less than its free-range or organic cousins.

Over 95% of broiler chickens are intensively reared in the UK. Organic and free-range chickens make up the rest. For as long as shoppers want cheap and plentiful chicken, they will continue to  be bred ever more intensively.

Sebastian was walking with his mother Ingrid in Australia when he had to explain he was her son. 
The mother and son were strolling along a footpath when Sebastian asked his mum if she knew who he was.

'You're a lovely carer,' said Ingrid while holding onto his arm.

'What if I told you I was your son?' asked Sebastian.

The mum was confused, thinking her boy was a minder with the same name. She didn't believe him at first, and said that he merely looked like her son Sebastian.

Her eyes lit up when she realized the truth and she sang a rendition of Vera Lynn's We'll Meet Again, edited to praise her boy and express her love for him. 

'Ingrid wants to meet Sebastian some sunny day, some sunny day, because Ingrid love Sebastian very much,' she sang.

1304,YFGzdR76a6Q,euronews,FEMEN give Putin and Merkel an eyeful in Hanover,2013-04-08T15:07:50Z,25,"http://www.euronews.com/ Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel came face to face - or face to breast - with naked FEMEN activists as they toured an industrial fair in Hanover on Monday.

The leaders were taking in a presentation of a new Volkswagen model when the four women started chanting ""f... dictator"". The activists had the same words painted in black ink across their chests and were eventually overpowered by security guards.

Merkel and Putin were attending the Hanover Messe in northern Germany, where Russia is this year's guest country. Photos taken afterwards suggest they saw the funny side of the protest, if not the motivation behind it.

At the event's inauguration on Sunday evening, Merkel urged Putin to ""give a chance"" to non-governmental organisations, describing them as a ""motor of innovation"" while, outside, demonstrators protested a recent Russian crackdown on NGOs that has included raids on their offices.



FEMEN is a protest group started in Ukraine in 2008, whose membership has grown to countries across the world.  According to ==its website==, its purpose is ""sextremism serving to protect women's rights, democracy watchdogs attacking patriarchy, in all its forms: the dictatorship, the church, the sex industry.""

Last Thursday topless FEMEN activists ""staged rallies in front of mosques and Tunisian embassies across Europe"":http://www.euronews.com/2013/04/04/femen-targets-islam-in-bare-breast-brussels-protest/ against what they called an Islamist attack on Arab women's rights.

For the first time in its history, the European Union will purchase weapons for a country under attack, said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. In a meeting on Sunday, EU foreign minister agreed to budget €500 million ($564 million) for weapons and equipment for Ukraine. Poland agreed to work as a logistic hub for the delivery of weapons. She also said EU airspace would be closed to Russia-owned, registered or controlled aircraft, explicitly mentioning that the ban would apply to ""the private jets of oligarchs."" Additionally, von der Leyen announced the 27-member bloc would take steps to stop ""the Kremlin's media machine in the EU"" by banning state-owned Russia Today, Sputnik and their subsidiaries. ""We are developing tools to ban their toxic and harmful disinformation in Europe,"" she said. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the move was aimed at ""turning off the tap for Russia's disinformation in Europe."" In addition to the measures against Russia, von der Leyen added that the EU agreed to sanction Russia's ally Belarus, which she called ""the other aggressor in this war."" In a message to the hundreds of thousands of people fleeing Ukraine, von der Leyen said they would be welcomed with ""open arms.""

Kyiv and Moscow have sent envoys to peace talks on the Belarus border. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was willing to ""try"" talks with Russia but added he is ""skeptical"" they will lead to a ceasefire. ""I will be honest, as always: I do not really believe in the outcome of this meeting, but let them try,"" Zelenskyy said in a video statement. If there was a ""chance"" to end the war, he should take part in the talks, he added

The ‘inexpensive and paper-thin’ technology works by bending light around a target to either alter its position or make it vanish altogether, leaving only the background visible. It is touted to be able to obscure the positions of heavy artillery, ground troops or even entire buildings from certain viewpoints.

2119,lF3mnuxjPCw,ABC News In-depth,The Year Bali Tourism Stopped | Foreign Correspondent,2021-03-09T09:00:14Z,25,"Bali’s natural beauty and rich culture have made it a tourist magnet but since COVID19, the island is struggling to stay afloat. Locals are questioning their dependence on tourism and the over-development it has unleashed.

Marcello and the lifeguards of Kuta Beach rise bright and early for their morning meeting and surf sprints. But they know it’s going to be a quiet day. While the iconic beach normally attracts 50 000 visitors a day from around the world, today the head lifeguard expects only 50 people.

“Nobody makes a life on the beach"", says Marcello. “People who sell massage, or merchandise on the beach…I heard they all go back home to their village. It’s a very sad situation.""

It’s a common story across the island, even in its remotest corners.

Off Bali’s east coast on the small island of Ceningan, Wayan lost his job at a hotel, and had to return to farming seaweed with his family. It’s the same story across Ceningan.

“Before we had 100 per cent tourism. Now 80 or 90 percent they are doing seaweed farms”, says Wayan who’s had to cop a 75% pay cut. “We had no choice but to return to nature.""

But some Balinese see the crisis as an opportunity.

“This is a wake-up call for all of us”, says Christia, a young businesswoman. “We realized that we cannot just depend on one industry.”

In this visually stunning story, reporter and cameraman Matt Davis travels around Bali and discovers an island in the midst of some serious soul searching.

He meets locals who are questioning the unhinged development that’s accompanied the tourist boom and who want to chart a different course for the future.

“Bali tourism industry is based on two things, nature and culture"", says rock star Robi Gede, “and we cannot sacrifice them”.

Politicians and businesspeople want to fix the congestion, pollution and rubbish problems and encourage a different type of tourism. One that’s sustainable and benefits locals more.

“I think it's a good time for reflection this year”, says Christia, “Go back to loving our island and make sure that people don't abuse our island as well.”

“We hope that when the tourists come back, they are coming with a good energy, they are not littering, with more respect for the local rules”, says Marcello. “Come with a good vibe.”

1624,-u0UeY4epuQ,Daily Mail,These Titanic submarine 'flaws' may be behind disaster,2023-06-23T11:55:02Z,25,"On 22 June the wreckage of the Titan submarine was found on the sea bed 500 yards from the Titanic. Experts say the submarine suffered a catastrophic implosion and the five passengers onboard died. It was steered by Playstation controller, used components bought from Camping World and didn’t have safety certification. But five missing Titanic tourists paid to descend 12,500ft in the Titan submarine. Now they have vanished without a trace, and questions are being asked why experts who raised safety concerns about the OceanGate vessel were apparently ignored. One of the engineers was so concerned he quit the project, one man was said to have refused to ride the sub after seeing how it was built, and one man who did described his voyage to a newspaper as ‘suicide’. These are all the potential concerns that could have led to disaster.

A police officer guarding the Prime Minister's official home had to knock on the famous black door to summon someone to open it.

The door can't be opened from the outside because it has no handle.

Instead a member of No10 staff had to come and open it from the inside, allowing Larry to slip back in to the warmth.

The whole incident was caught on camera in the background of a Sky News live broadcast.

Viewers were distracted from the political update by the feline's antics.

Recessions usually come with a dip in economic output and a rise in unemployment. Right now, economic output is falling. But so is unemployment. WSJ’s Jon Hilsenrath has coined it a “jobful downturn.” We look at past recessions and indicators to explain how a recession in 2020 could be very different.

The regiment's commanding officer - Col Sergei Sukharev - died in mid-March. His chief of staff and numerous other officers have also fallen.

The regiment previously served in the Balkans, Chechnya and the 2014 Russia invasion in the Donbas.

Tracking the unit through Ukraine, Newsnight’s diplomatic and defence editor Mark Urban looks at the outpouring of grief and anger from Russia in response to the devastating losses. What went wrong for the once-elite regiment? And what does its fate tell us about Russia's invasion of Ukraine?

This film was produced by Maria Jevstafjeva and Louis Harris-White.

1940,z_wlQZ5N_2k,On Demand News,Joe Biden's Most Awkward Gaffes Of All Time (Part 1),2020-05-15T01:00:20Z,25,"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden once described himself as a “gaffe machine” and we have to agree. Here’s a hilarious collection of epic awkward moments throughout his career in politics.

From several out-of-place jokes to some seriously unfortunate incidents, former Vice-President Biden's goofiness is either considered charming or alarming by the US electorate. 

Ironically, in 2008 Mr Biden said that Hillary Clinton is “more qualified than I am to be Vice-President of the United States of America.”

Maybe it helps that the then-President Barack Obama reacted to most of his gaffes with bemusement. 

However, could some of these embarrassing moments make his race for the White House against incumbent President Donald Trump more difficult?

The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol will hold its first hearing June 9, offering a glimpse into what it has learned about what led to the insurrection that day and the role of the White House, law enforcement and other officials and agencies before, during and after the attack.

The PBS NewsHour's special coverage of the hearing will begin at 8 p.m. ET. Before the hearing begins, the PBS NewsHour's Nicole Ellis will take a look at what we've learned about the attack since that day, including conversations with Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University professor of history, on the fallout for democracy, and the NewsHour's Lisa Desjardins, who reported from inside the Capitol as it was attacked and will cover the committee's hearing.

Thursday's hearing is the first of several the committee, led by  Reps. Bennie Thomas, D-Miss., and Liz Cheney R-Wyo., plans to hold this month to lay out key findings. The nine-member panel has interviewed dozens of witnesses, including those within the Secret Service and the White House along with members of law enforcement, Congress and former President Donald Trump's family. They've subpoenaed more than 100 people to testify in the months leading up to the hearings. A select few have also been indicted by the Department of Justice for being in contempt of Congress after refusing to participate.

1512,LGXwJnZSIkQ,Washington Post,Most of the dead Astroworld Festival victims were in one highly packed area | Visual Forensics,2021-11-24T13:00:08Z,25,"UPDATE: After this video was published, The Post determined Bharti Shahani, another victim, was also in the south quadrant when the concert began, according to a video she took that was obtained by The Post. In an interview, Shahani's sister, who was with her at the concert, confirmed the location. 

The Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences announced on Dec. 16 that all 10 deaths were due to compression asphyxia, meaning the victims were squeezed so tightly that they lost their ability to draw a breath.

***

At least seven of the 10 dead after Travis Scott's Astroworld Festival were clustered in a small area enclosed on three sides by metal barriers that became dangerously crowded, according to a Washington Post investigation. The review — based on dozens of videos examined for when and where each was taken, interviews with witnesses, and an analysis by crowd experts — reveals how a crowd surge at a performance by Scott turned one pocket of the audience into an epicenter of chaos and distress.

Ten fans at the Nov. 5 concert in Houston died and dozens more were injured, making it one of the most deadly concerts in the nation’s history. The Post found that most of those who died were close to each other in the viewing area’s south quadrant, where witnesses described people collapsing under the pressure of the crowd. Three concertgoers who died appeared unconscious in a pile of other fallen fans in the south quadrant only 16 minutes into the show, according to a video reviewed by The Post. The concert continued for nearly another hour. In parts of the tightly compressed area where many of the dead were concentrated, there were as little as 1.85 square feet per person, according to an analysis done by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University for The Post. At that density, people are amid a crowd that is at risk of dangerously collapsing in on itself, two crowd science experts said.

The Post’s reconstruction of the night’s events, including details evident in exclusively obtained videos, also underscores unanswered questions about how long the concert was allowed to continue after fans already were pleading for help and receiving emergency care.

It’s not easy. But as a pediatric palliative care physician, she works to ensure that terminally ill children receive quality end-of-life care. Palliative care is sometimes misunderstood to shorten life expectancy, but it’s a method that increases quality of life, improves symptom burden and decreases medical costs. We follow Dr. Tremonti in John Beder's ""Dying in Your Mother's Arms"" as she works to make death less medical and more human. In the process she asks a critical question: When a child is terminally ill, how can we make the end of life a better one?

262,NRmGfmqx29g,Al Jazeera English,Saudi Aramco: The Company and the State,2019-02-01T19:58:16Z,25,"For the past two years, Saudi Arabia has prepared to place its national oil company on the stock market. Officials talked up the Saudi Aramco initial public offering (IPO) with international exchanges and global banks. It seemed like a great idea that the world's largest oil producing company, valued at $2 trillion, would become the world's largest ever traded stock.

There are many companies in the world which move and shake markets but perhaps no other organization essential to running a country. Aramco is unique and it runs no ordinary country. Saudi Arabia plays a key role in moving global oil prices. The oil market affects everyone on the planet directly or indirectly. Oil prices have developed and destroyed economies – Sudan and Venezuela being the most recent examples. So that company shedding its cloak of secrecy and deciding to go public is a huge deal. Specially for Saudi Arabia which is run by a monarchy and its affairs cannot be publicly evaluated or scrutinized.

The proposed listing of the national champion was a central part of the young Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030, a reform drive aimed at restructuring the kingdom's economy and reducing its dependence on oil revenue. 

""I think there was a strong case for the IPO and there still is for the selling of a stake of Saudi Aramco and there are lots of reasons for it,"" explains Jim Krane, an energy researcher at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy. While Saudi Arabia, like other Gulf states have been trying to move away their economies from oil dependency for years, ""the specter of climate action has finally made the Saudis get serious about it. And really the only way to diversify is through Aramco and Aramco is the source of revenues that the Saudi state needs to build other economic sectors.""

The Kingdom holds about 16 percent of the world’s oil reserves and is the largest exporter of petroleum among OPEC countries. Nearly half of the country's GDP comes from oil and Aramco itself employs 65,000 people.

The concerns about radical changes in strategy put a spanner in the works for Saudi Aramco's public listing. For the first time in its history, an IPO would bring full public disclosure of Aramco's financial details, a feat that has never been made public.

""Probably the biggest downside is the transparency that would have resulted around Saudi oil reserves,"" says Krane, a number that doesn't move beyond 260 billion barrels. ""If Saudi Aramco would have listed shares on the NYSE or the London stock exchange, the regulators would have forced Saudi Arabia to come clean on all of its reserves, how much of that is proven probable or otherwise.""

A lot has changed since Mohammed bin Salman's international public relations drive such as the imprisonment of top Saudi businessmen, the murde r of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the continued wa r on Yemen, and the Saudi-led blockade on neighbouring Qatar. That has resulted in a flight of capital, reduced foreign investment, increased Saudi borrowing and a halt on Saudi Aramco's IPO.

This is not the first time reforms have been promised in Saudi Arabia. ""In many ways, Mohammed bin Salman resembles his grandfather Abdul Aziz al-Saud,"" according to Chas Freeman, former US Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. The late leader united the country ""with tribal marriages...conducted a wa r in the Saudi south, which took land from Yemen...suppressed religious uprisings and it worked."" Whether his grandson's current ambitions will work is ""unknown,"" says Freeman.

Aramco owns the largest refinery in the US, Motiva, and hundreds of facilities across the globe and funds universities, think-tanks, lobbying firms and controls a vast media empire. That money shapes policy and perceptions while also covering up criticism of the kingdom.

Saudi Aramco's failure to launch and a young leader's stumble from one crisis to another are directly linked. There is an urgency to rush into things but also a lack of experience. ""That is really like planning for the growth of a nation, not the exit of an IPO,"" says Chad Brownstein, a hydrocarbon investment analyst and CEO of Rocky Mountain Resources. ""And the growth of a nation takes a lot more planning than a couple of months.""

Saudi Aramco: The Company and the State examines the reasons behind the ambitious offering, the politics of Saudi oil, the strategic importance of Aramco, a faulty evaluation, the challenges of transparency and what it means for an ambitious Prince's 'Vision 2030'.

1942,YbfEvAmZs8g,On Demand News,Funny moments you missed from the Trump-Kim summit,2019-02-28T15:12:50Z,25,"Here are some of the lighter moments from the Trump-Kim summit in Hanoi. The highlights include jogging bodyguards, a Kim Jong-un lookalike being deported and Kim having a smoke break as his sister holds a crystal ashtray. Also we see Trump frantically waving a Vietnam flag and seemingly understanding Kim's jokes, even though Korean leader spoke in his native tongue. We see the pair enjoying a 'private dinner' in front of the gathered media, including one of the ""world's greatest photographers"". After the summit ended with no agreement we see Trump having an awkward moment with a bunch of flowers then stumbling slightly as enters Air Force One.

Report by Matt Blair.

263,yZs4PqKlph0,Al Jazeera English,What is the human cost to China's economic miracle? | Head to Head,2019-03-15T12:57:48Z,25,"In this episode of Head to Head, Mehdi Hasan challenges Charles Liu, Senior Fellow at Peking University, seasoned Chinese entrepreneur and informal adviser to the Chinese government, on Xi Jinping’s record in power so far, the government’s crackdown on the Uighur Muslim minority, and what role for China if it becomes the 21st century’s military and economic superpower.

With the presidential term limit abolished in 2018, critics say that Chinese President Xi Jinping appears to be paving the way to being able to stay in power for life, but Charles Liu, founder of Hao Capital, disputes this. Separately, despite lower-than-predicted growth, China is still growing substantially and is set to become the world’s biggest economy.

But the economic boom has been paired with an increase in state surveillance and crackdowns on dissent, as well as the repression of the Muslim Uighur minority. So at what cost has China’s economic miracle come? And what’s the future for civil liberties of the Chinese people?

In recent years China has also increased its military spending while some Chinese officials have been ratcheting up their militaristic rhetoric, raising fears of direct military confrontation with the United States.

On this Head to Head episode filmed at the Oxford Union, we challenge Charles Liu on all these topics, ask him whether the Chinese economy has hit a wall, and whether China’s neighbours should dismiss their fears as his country builds up its military and extends its global reach.

We are joined by a panel of three experts:

Andreas Fulda - China Specialist at Asia Research Institute and Assistant Professor at the School of Politics and International Relations, University of Nottingham.  

Victor Gao - Vice President of the Beijing based Center for China and Globalization and former interpreter for the late President Deng Xiaoping.

Steve Tsang - Professor and Director of the China Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) University of London.

In US news and current events today, President Donald J. Trump has claimed to be the smartest, most intelligent president in US history, though his knowledge of the country's past leaves somewhat to be desired. From his defense of Andrew Jackson, complete misunderstanding of the Confederacy and why the Confederate Army was fighting in the Civil War history, and numerous other inaccuracies about world history and U.S. history, this President Trump history lesson will no doubt leave you dumber about the state of history. For President Trump, smart is a state of mind, and while many have cast doubts on the President's intelligence, we'll let this Trump history lesson speak for itself.

Stockholm and Helsinki have long pursued policies of military neutrality to avoid conflict with regional powers.

But, Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said ""everything had changed"" when Russia attacked Ukraine and told reporters that Helsinki must to be ""prepared for all kinds of actions from Russia"".

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has stressed that Moscow would have to ""rebalance the situation"" with its own measures if the Nato bid went ahead.

Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto has said it would be ""useful"" for Sweden and Finland to launch joint Nato membership bids, but added that no fixed date had been set for any potential application.

In his nightly video address, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised the Ukrainian people for surviving so long under relentless attack. Ukraine is also claiming a victory in its efforts to repel Russian forces at sea.
Russia's military has confirmed that its main warship in the Black Sea, the Moskva, sank while being towed back to port in stormy weather. Moscow says the ship suffered a fire and explosion. But Ukraine says the damage was caused by its missiles hitting the vessel on Wednesday off the port of Odesa. 
The loss of the warship is a setback for Russia, and a symbolic victory for Ukraine, which Zelenskyy picked up on in his address.

47 people were inside the White Island volcano crater when it erupted.

21 were killed.

19 of them were from the Ovation of the Seas.

Four Corners investigates what tourists understood about the dangers of visiting New Zealand’s most active volcano and whether more could have been done to prevent the tragedy.

2121,1Xij_cIe5_A,ABC News In-depth,Gwarosa: Working to Death in South Korea | Foreign Correspondent,2021-08-26T10:00:13Z,25,"Since the start of the pandemic, 21 delivery workers in South Korea have died. Unions blame overwork. The Koreans even have a word for death by overwork: 'gwarosa'. 

We all rely on home deliveries to get us through the pandemic but do we ever spare a thought for the workers who bring them to us?

As demand for home deliveries explodes, the pressure on warehouse sorters and drivers has become relentless. 

Lee Seong Wook, 44, is a delivery driver. He works six days a week from early in the morning until late at night.

“I'd be lying if I said it isn't tough for me. But it’s a matter of survival. My children won't eat if I don't earn.”

Lee’s colleague, 47-year-old driver Im Gwang Soo, recently suffered a massive brain haemorrhage and fell into a coma. His life is hanging in the balance. Before his collapse, Im Gwang Soo had been working over 90 hours a week.

As companies compete with each other to offer faster delivery times, distribution workers and drivers have borne the brunt, putting in longer and longer hours. 

The ABC’s South Korea correspondent Carrington Clarke goes on the road with the drivers and hears stories of their struggles as they race against the clock to deliver more packages than ever before.

He rides with 61-year-old driver Huh Wonjea, the son of an activist and fighter in the Korean Independence Movement. Mr Huh says South Koreans worked hard to rebuild their country after the war, but not everyone is reaping the rewards.

“The whole country’s been developing, but still in terms of the fair distribution of the assets or human rights… not really fairly developed yet.”

Lee Seong Wook is a branch leader of the Delivery Workers’ Union. He’s determined that his generation will be the one to force change.

“If our generation can't change it, it’ll be passed down to the next generation and then what we sacrifice for our children would be meaningless. “

It’s not just the drivers who are suffering. Those working in the distribution centres are also being pushed to their limits and beyond.

27-year-old Jang Deokjoon died of a heart attack. He’d been working long hours in the “fulfillment centre” of e-commerce company Coupang, described as the “Amazon” of South Korea. The government ruled it was “death by overwork”.

“These really clever people used their brains only to work out how to squeeze as much blood from the workers as possible within the boundaries of the law”, says Deokjoon’s mother.

In response to union pressure, some companies have introduced restrictions on delivering parcels after 9pm. But many drivers still have parcels left. If they don’t deliver them, their workload the following day will be even greater, so they keep working. For any food items they deliver after the 9pm cutoff, they’ll pay late fees. They’re damned if they do, damned if they don’t.

Dead on Arrival is a timely and cautionary tale of what happens when workers are pushed to the limit in the name of consumer convenience and company profits.

“If consumers don’t start thinking about it there will be other victims. Do you really think it’s okay to turn a blind eye or force someone to be sacrificed for your convenience?”, asks Deokjoon’s mother.

2122,9HZdQGoFjqQ,ABC News In-depth,Bon Scott's High Voltage life as AC/DC front man | On the Brink full documentary | Australian Story,2022-05-09T10:00:05Z,25,"In a world exclusive, Australian Story unravels the legend of AC/DC front man Bon Scott, who was on the verge of becoming an international rock star when he died at age 33.

For the first time ever, the program has been granted access to Bon’s family and friends who provide fresh insights into his vulnerabilities and state of mind leading up to his untimely death in London in 1980.

The program features the first interview with Bon’s younger brother Derek and is introduced by Brian Johnson, Bon’s successor with the band.

Bruce Howe, a former bandmate who shared a house with Bon for five years, noticed a big change when he last saw him in late 1979.

“He wasn’t bubbly and laughing.  Maybe he’d come to the state where he’d achieved his dream, he found his holy grail, but found that his holy grail might have looked like an empty goblet,” he told the program.

To this day, Bon Scott is considered one of the world’s best rock and roll singers.

Speaking to top military officials, including Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, Putin said Western nations had taken ""unfriendly actions"" towards Russia and imposed ""illegitimate sanctions"".

The move makes it easier to launch weapons - but the BBC’s security correspondent Gordon Corera said it was a way for Russia to send a warning to Nato, rather than signalling an intent to use them.

The US has condemned the move as ""unacceptable”.

What's His Forecast For 2020? | NYT Opinion,2020-08-05T17:00:09Z,25,"Right now, polls say Joe Biden has a healthy lead over President Trump. But we’ve been here before (cue 2016), and the polls were, frankly, wrong. One man, however, was not. The historian Allan Lichtman was the lonely forecaster who predicted Mr. Trump’s victory in 2016 — and also prophesied the president would be impeached. That’s two for two. But Professor Lichtman’s record goes much deeper. In 1980, he developed a presidential prediction model that retrospectively accounted for 120 years of U.S. election history. Over the past four decades, his system has accurately called presidential victors, from Ronald Reagan in ’84 to, well, Mr. Trump in 2016.

In the video Op-Ed above, Professor Lichtman walks us through his system, which identifies 13 “keys” to winning the White House. Each key is a binary statement: true or false. And if six or more keys are false, the party in the White House is on its way out.

So what do the keys predict for 2020? To learn that, you’ll have to watch the video.

1155,OKKbkS_LOu4,The Economist,Why does time pass?,2015-09-03T19:30:01Z,28,"The equations of physics suggest time should be able to go backwards as well as forwards. Experience suggests, though, that it cannot. Why? And is time travel really possible?

Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.trib.al/rWl91R7 

Why does time pass? It is a question so profound that few people would even think to ask it. Yet its effects are all around. Human beings live in a perpetual present, inexorably sealed off from the past, but moving relentlessly into the future. For most people, time seems to be something that is just out there. A thing ticking away in the background - fixed, immutable. Time seems to go in one direction and in one direction only. But physicists see it much differently.

One of the great minds who changed the way science thinks about time was Albert Einstein. In 1905 he published his special theory of relativity. In it he demonstrated that time passes differently in different places depending on how those places are moving with respect to one another.

Einstein showed that the faster one travels the slower time goes for the traveler. At the speeds at which humans move this is imperceptible. But for someone traveling on a spaceship at speeds close to that of light, time would slow down compared with its passage for people on earth.

There was another important aspect of Einstein's theory which he didn't even realize when he published it. That time was woven into the very fabric of space itself. Einstein used this insight to help develop his general theory of relativity which incorporated gravity. He published it in 1915. 

With the general theory of relativity he demonstrated that massive objects warped the fabric of space-time. It is this curvature that causes time to slow down near them. Time slows down in proportion to the gravitational pull of a nearby object so the effect would be strong near a black hole but milder near the earth. But even here it can be detected. Einstein's theories had to be taken into account when the GPS system was set up otherwise it would have been inaccurate. 

One scientist who puzzled over the directionality of time was Arthur Eddington, a 20th century astronomer who defined the concept of the arrow of time, based on observations made by the 19th century physicist Ludwig Boltzmann. The arrow of time is based on the second law of thermodynamics which says the disorder known as entropy increases with time. For example, a building left untouched will slowly decay into its surroundings. It will disintegrate into a more chaotic state but it is highly unlikely that the building will become more orderly over time - this is because there are many more ways for a system to be disorderly than orderly. There can be many ways for something to break for instance but only one way for it to be put back together again. A system will be less disordered in the past and more disordered in the future. This is the arrow of time. 

So how can the arrow of time be reconciled with Einstein's equations? If time can go forwards and backwards according to relativity does that mean it's possible to go backwards in time? The theory of relativity does allow time travel to the future.

Einstein's theories do allow for the formation of wormholes in space. These are shortcuts that link otherwise distant places in the space-time continuum. 

Although wormholes are theoretically possible they're a highly implausible proposition. That's because the equations suggest enormous masses and energies would be required to create and manipulate one. 

What remains then is a mystery. Theory fails to forbid traveling backwards in time but practice suggests it might just as well be forbidden. For now it would appear the arrow of time cannot be reversed. No one knows why time passes but it seems that no matter how people look at it, it goes in one direction in one direction only.

It’s understood that Mr Abramovich was taking part in informal peace talks when he became ill, along with two Ukrainian negotiators.  The symptoms are said to have included red eyes and peeling skin on the face and hands.

However a US official said intelligence suggested the cause was environmental and not deliberate poisoning.  Presidential officials in Kyiv also sought to play down the claims.

2123,O8KQbZDatg0,ABC News In-depth,Japan's Great Wall: Can It Stop A Tsunami? | Foreign Correspondent,2021-03-02T09:00:17Z,25,"When a massive tsunami engulfed the north-eastern coastline of Japan a decade ago, it wiped out everything in its path, flattening villages, killing nearly 20,000 people and triggering a nuclear meltdown.

The old seawalls which had been built along the coastline to protect villages and infrastructure offered little protection. Today, the government’s solution to a future tsunami is to build an even bigger and longer seawall to protect Japan’s coastal communities.

Up to 14 metres high and 400 kilometres long, the new seawall is dividing
communities, and some fear, placing them in greater danger.

In this ARTE documentary, presented by former ABC Japan correspondent Mark Willacy, The Great Wall of Japan travels along the north-eastern coast of Japan’s main island to meet the fishermen and communities affected by one of the country’s biggest ever construction projects.

Oyster farmer Atsushi Fujita has mixed feelings about the wall, saying it’s destroying his community’s livelihood and culture.

“We're all very sad that our former lifestyle has gone and we can no longer see the ocean from our windows. It's really affecting us a lot.”

In the village of Akahama, fisherman Hiromi Kawaguchi has galvanised locals against the building of a giant wall. While he lost his wife and mother to the 2011 tsunami, he has no faith a new seawall will protect locals in the event of another great wave.

“In the last tsunami, the old wall was destroyed and its remains were left floating on the surface like cubes of tofu. Everything man-made is destined to be destroyed. It’s inevitable.”

But others support the wall, including construction executive Kazunori Yamamoto, who believes the old seawall saved his family in 2011.

“The breakwater earned us precious time, enabling a lot of people to escape. Without the breakwater, my whole family would have died.”

Scientists are divided on the benefits. Some say the wall will slow a tsunami’s advance, allowing more time for people to escape. Others say it will do the opposite, providing a false sense of security, delaying departure and putting people in greater danger.

Some believe the 13 billion US dollars spent on the wall’s construction could have been better used moving more communities to higher ground.

As Japan commemorates the tsunami’s 10th anniversary, this is a moving and timely story from the region hardest hit by the 2011 disaster.

2124,Oqh6hGLqAG8,ABC News In-depth,"Salt, Sewage and Sinkholes: The Death of the Dead Sea | Foreign Correspondent",2021-06-10T10:00:14Z,25,"It’s the lowest place on earth. A sea in the middle of a desert. Fed by the waters of the Jordan River, nestled on the borders of Israel, Jordan and the West Bank, the Dead Sea has supported life and provided spiritual healing for millennia. 

But today the Dead Sea is disappearing, its waterline receding year by year. And the fight over this diminishing resource is fueling tensions between Palestinians and Israelis.

In a visually stunning story, correspondent Eric Tlozek travels through this ancient land to unravel the mysteries of this vanishing sea.

Upstream in the Jordan Valley, the waters which feed into the Dead Sea have been diverted for agriculture and now there’s not enough to go around.

Zeyad, whose family lives in the Jordan Valley, says Palestinian farmers aren’t getting their fair share of water.

“They have a very big shortage of water. The water allocated for this village actually is less than 50% of the needed water.”

David, an Israeli farmer, says the Jewish settlers have used the water well, making an arid land productive and fertile.

‘When we came to the Jordan Valley, we found a desert’, says David, a spokesperson for settlers in the West Bank. ‘Nothing was growing here. So now the Jordan Valley is green.’

Downstream, as a result of less water, the landscape around the Dead Sea is being dramatically transformed and is collapsing in on itself. It’s creating a strange phenomenon - ‘sinkholes’.

Highways which once teemed with traffic are now buckled and broken. Holiday resorts which once hosted families are abandoned and ruined.

“It’s a spectacular landscape that developed in a few years”, says an Israeli government geologist.

Meanwhile, the faithful still believe in the waters’ healing powers even though much of the water they bless now comes from sewage pipes.

“Once the water of the river is blessed…anyone that has any kind of pain or any kind of bad feelings he can wash himself with this water and he can be healed”, says an Armenian Orthodox priest.

There’s debate about schemes which could halt the sea’s decline but there’s little political will. 

“Who will pay the price for this water?”, asks one geologist.

This is an epic journey through a land with a rich history, a troubled present and an uncertain future.

“If our children will say that they wanted to save it, they can't even do it because it's too late. Everything that's happening here, it's because of us,” says Carmit, an Israeli hydrologist.

After a night of intense shelling on the Ukrainian capital, Russian operatives are now in Kyiv.

12,306wDjZ99Fo,CNN,CNN gets first look at a captured Russian drone. See what was found inside,2022-07-21T23:11:40Z,25,"CNN's Nic Robertson shows how Western technology used in drones is helping Russia to track and kill Ukrainian forces.

Opinion: The American-made weapons that could change everything
by David A. Andelman

It seems that increasingly these days, the United States is letting Ukraine fight, valiantly, but is it with one hand tied behind its back?

The US and its allies have given the Ukrainians artillery systems, some of them quite advanced, but withheld those with the longest range or, as arms experts have suggested, the greatest sophistication.

In an address to Congress on Wednesday, Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska asked US lawmakers to send air defense systems to her country ""in order for rockets not to kill children in their strollers.""
Still, Ukrainian officials have expressed their public gratitude for weapons delivered so far. Ukranian President Voldymyr Zelensky, in his daily video message Monday, observed that his armed forces are now ""able to inflict significant logistical losses on the occupiers.""

Military observers tell me that Zelensky and his senior generals have expressed their delight in the new systems that are appearing, hoping that their words will encourage a greater willingness of the West to release even more advanced systems that could turn the tide of battle by leaps and bounds.

There is an electronic war that cries out to be fought -- drones that need to be jammed or flown to precise targets, long-range artillery with GPS targeting, enemy chatter that needs to be plucked from the skies. Some of these capabilities are increasing as the West gradually introduces new systems to the battlefield and trains Ukrainians to operate them.

Subscribe to The Guardian on YouTube ► http://is.gd/subscribeguardian

The 29-year-old is a former technical assistant for the CIA and current employee of the defence contractor Booz Allen Hamilton. Snowden has been working at the National Security Agency for the last four years as an employee of various outside contractors, including Booz Allen and Dell.

The Guardian, after several days of interviews, is revealing his identity at his request. From the moment he decided to disclose numerous top-secret documents to the public, he was determined not to opt for the protection of anonymity. “I have no intention of hiding who I am because I know I have done nothing wrong,” he said.

Snowden will go down in history as one of America’s most consequential whistleblowers, alongside Daniel Ellsberg and Bradley Manning. He is responsible for handing over material from one of the world’s most secretive organisations – the NSA.

A turning point in the history of our continent. That's how Chancellor Olaf Scholz described Russia's war against Ukraine. Speaking to a special session of parliament, the German leader announced a raft of policy changes that would have been unthinkable just days ago. Germany will drastically strengthen its military, and move quickly to eliminate its reliance on Russian energy exports. He put the blame squarely on Russian President Vladimir Putin - who he said had brought decades of peaceful coexistence to an end. Here's some of what he said.
Holding out in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said Russia's military assault verges on genocide - and he's called for Russia to be stripped of its seat on the UN Security Council. Moscow's forces targeted civilian infrastructure overnight, including gas pipelines - as they stepped up efforts to push further into Ukraine.
Moscow's forces have met stiff resistance as they attempt to push further into Ukraine. The mayor of Kyiv says the capital is holding its defense lines and there are no Russian troops in the city. And after reports of heavy fighting in eastern Kharkiv, the regional governor says Ukrainian forces have retaken full control of the city. Russia's latest attacks have targeted civilian infrastructure and the military.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine has sent tens of thousands of people fleeing their homes since Thursday. Huge crowds have been waiting at train stations to travel to the border and cross into neighboring countries. Scenes from Lviv in western Ukraine show the fear and frustration: There's not enough space on the trains to carry everyone to safety. Men are forced to say goodbye to their families, as they are not allowed to leave because they've been called up to fight. Many of the refugees are headed to Poland.
Ukraine is doing its best to repel the Russian attack by training civilians to fight. Support from the US and other NATO members has also bolstered national defenses. But few believe Ukraine is a match for its much larger neighbor. 
Taking active and reserve troops together, Kyiv can draw on more than 1 million men and women. Russia has more than three million. Ukraine has less than 2,500 tanks, compared to Russia's 13,000.
And in the air, Ukraine has just 67 attack aircraft in contrast to Russia's 1,500.
In Berlin a demonstration calling for restoring peace in Ukraine is underway, with estimates of 20,000 or more people taking part in the protest.
The demonstration is organized by a variety of groups including workers' unions, religious groups and environmental organizations. Protesters are calling on Russia to immediately withdraw from Ukraine and to respect democracy and human rights. In the past days there have been numerous demonstrations across the world in support of Ukraine and demanding an immediate end to all violence.

958,23LlgYbq-G8,The Sun,Russia releases U.S prisoner Trevor Reed in return for Russian pilot,2022-04-28T11:25:42Z,25,"RUSSIA has released U.S prisoner Trevor Reed in a surprise chain of events that has seen Russian pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko freed in return. 

In a surprise prisoner swap – former U.S. marine Trevor Reed, who was detained in Russia since 2019, has been released.

Russian pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko - who was serving a 20-year sentence in the United States for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine – was released in return.

The swap, which U.S. officials have said was the result of months of hard and careful work, comes as U.S.-Russia relations are at their worst in decades.

Officials said the talks that led to Reed’s release strictly focused on securing his freedom… and was not the start of a broader diplomatic conversation.

President Joe Biden did not comment on details of the release, but said (quote) ""The negotiations that allowed us to bring Trevor home required difficult decisions that I do not take lightly.""

The 90-minute meeting took a different format to usual thanks to restrictions necessitated by the coronavirus pandemic. There were no standard handshake between the two presidential candidates, and moderator Fox News star Chris Wallace had a much smaller audience than usual to contend with. 

With Mr Trump, 74, telling Mr Biden, 77, ""there is nothing smart about you, Joe”, and Mr Biden branding the president ""a bulldozer”, the debate produced several heated moments.

2125,Q4JhhhrjGgw,ABC News In-depth,The City where Thousands of Russians have fled since the Invasion of Ukraine | Foreign Correspondent,2022-04-28T10:00:12Z,25,"Since President Putin invaded Ukraine in February, some 200,000 Russians have fled their country, scattering across western and eastern Europe.

Around 30,000 have landed in Georgia, a former Soviet country on Russia’s southern border, where it’s cheap to live and visas are easy to get. 

Nika Nikulshina can’t see herself going home any time soon.

“I really think that I will not be able to go to Russia till Putin will, I don't know, die, disappear, become a bug or something. So yes, I think we need to wait for his death.”

The Russian refugees are distressed at the invasion of Ukraine and the brutal crackdown on free speech.

Ekaterina and her husband Tikhon were high-profile presenters at the independent station in Moscow, TV Rain. When it shut down shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, they fled.

“There is no guarantee that they will arrest you, but there's no guarantee that they won't. So there are much more chances that you're going to be in jail, if you go back and we're not ready to have this kind of risks. We have kids,” says Tikhon.

“It was the most stressful and terrible moment of my life. We have decided everything that we are leaving and to you know pack up stuff and wake up kids in the middle of the night … A couple of hours and your whole life has changed”, says Ekaterina.

In a timely story, we film both inside Russia and in neighbouring Georgia, meeting the brave people opposing Putin and his war.

In St Petersburg, we meet 76-year-old artist Yelena who’s been arrested for protesting against the war but is refusing to stay silent. 

“There are good Russians too. But now there is so much shame for our country, so much disgrace. Russia always had much to be proud of. But this is all so awful.”

Dissidents inside Russia are increasingly isolated as State TV whips up hostility against anyone who questions the government.

But those who’ve landed in Georgia feel vulnerable too because the Georgian government has been reluctant to criticise Putin for fear of reprisals. Many Russians living in Georgia are unsure how long they’ll be welcome there.

“We know that Georgian government is not happy with us being here because they are afraid that …Georgia will become a safe space for Russian independent journalists,” says Tikhon.

“It is not a safe space.”

Addressing MEPs over video-link, the wartime leader said every square in his country would be renamed “freedom square” in honour of Ukraine’s fight against the Russian invasion.

Nobody is going to enter and intervene with our freedom,” he said, from his secret bunker in Kyiv. “Believe you me every square, as of today, no matter what it’s called, is going to be called freedom square in every city of our country.

“Nobody is going to break us, we’re strong, we’re Ukrainians.”

President Zelensky also challenged EU leaders to “prove” they are Europeans by backing his bid for Ukraine to join the bloc.

“Prove you are with us, do prove that you will not let us go, do prove that you, indeed, are Europeans and then life will win over death and light will win over darkness,” he said.

""My response to you destroying all these things is to have a Big Mac - because, you know what, it's a free country, it's a democracy and I'm allowed to eat meat.

Images from the scene show dozens of burnt-out tanks after Ukrainian forces shelled pontoon bridges across the Siversky Donets river in the Luhansk region.

It’s thought almost an entire battalion of vehicles was lost - it’s not known how many men were killed.

However, Russian forces appear to be making gains elsewhere in the area, with reports that they have taken the nearby town of Rubizhne.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the House of Commons by video link Tuesday evening, and received a standing ovation after paraphrasing one of Winston Churchill's famous wartime speeches in vowing his continued resistance of Russia's invasion.

""We will not give up and we will not lose. We will fight to the end, at sea, in the air. We will continue fighting for our land, whatever the cost, in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets,"" Zelenskyy said.

The Ukrainian president added his country was fighting for its survival, and called on UK lawmakers to continue applying pressure on the Kremlin with sanctions.

Zelenskyy's address to a packed house in the Westminster chamber came shortly after the UK announced it would be phasing out imports of Russian oil in response to the invasion of Ukraine.

US President Joe Biden said that the US will also no longer import Russian oil.

""We will not be part of subsidizing Putin's war,"" Biden said. Energy imports provide a vital source of income for the Kremlin.

As Putin's brutal attack on the Ukraine continues to unfold, the 44-year-old actor-turned-president has spent the duration of the war in the trenches with his military, advocating on behalf of his country. Through tweets, video press conferences and conversations with global leaders,  Zelensky has worked tirelessly to inform the world  of the atrocities being committed on behalf of  Putin. In doing so, he has become an almost folkloric pillar of bravery and strength – but as the days stretch into weeks, and weeks into months, the weight of the conflict has taken a visceral toll on the leader, who has gone from clean-cut, suit-wearing politician to a grizzled military man.

Four years on, he's presiding over a nation that is bitterly divided with a troubled economy and a population ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic.

With just over a week to go before polling day, Four Corners examines whether Donald Trump can once again defy the polls and his critics and secure a second presidential term.

Opinion polls are giving Democrat contender Joe Biden a decisive lead, and despite Donald Trump's insistence, even some of his most prominent supporters concede he has a battle on his hands.

Anita Álvarez, 25, had just completed her solo free final at the championships in Budapest on Wednesday when she collapsed and sank to the bottom of the pool.

Her coach, Andrea Fuentes, soon realised something was wrong and dived fully clothed into the pool to rescue Álvarez and pull her up to the surface.

The swimmer, who is competing at her third world championships, was not breathing when Fuentes and another helper dragged her poolside.

Fans and teammates were emotional as she was taken away on a stretcher to the medical centre - but Team USA later issued a statement saying she was ""okay"".

As many as three dozen congressional Republicans were expected to launch a final challenge to the results of the 2020 presidential election.

It has become routine after recent elections for House lawmakers on the losing side to put up a symbolic fight over the results, which they can do under an 1880s law governing the process. It has been less common for senators to join them, but this time a dozen will. Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) will lead the challenge of the votes and call for an “emergency audit” to investigate baseless fraud allegations.

The Post’s Libby Casey will anchor live coverage, featuring reporters Aaron Blake, Rhonda Colvin, James Hohmann and Amber Phillips. Read more: https://wapo.st/3ohQZCg. Read more: https://wapo.st/3ohQZCg. Subscribe to The Washington Post on YouTube: https://wapo.st/2QOdcqK

Video released by the club showed a smiling Bale being greeted by team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo as he arrived at the Valdebebas training ground.

He was then greeted by manager Carlo Ancelotti and his assistant Zinedine Zidane at a pre-training session in a meeting room.

Bale then joined the rest of players for a two-hour session, where he met up with his former Spurs team-mate Luka Modric.

Only Ancelotti, and perhaps his coaching staff, know whether Bale will make his debut during Saturday's La Liga match against Villarreal.

But Wales boss Chris Coleman said on Wednesday that Bale is not fit enough to play a full 90 minutes.

Real have won their opening three La Liga matches under Ancelotti, who replaced Jose Mourinho at the end of last season. Report by Mark Morris.

Russian missiles pounded Ukraine as families cowered in shelters and air raid sirens wailed across the major cities on the second day of Putin's full-scale invasion.

But Russia also appeared to be advancing on the outskirts of Kharkiv nearly 300 miles away as Russian forces drove deeper into Ukraine.

Our Sun man Jerome was forced to duck for cover with Ukrainian troops as Russian shells rained down nearby.

Reporting from the outskirts of the city, Jerome said: ""Everyone just had to take cover... we could hear the shells going over.""

Dramatic footage filmed on the front line showed a Ukrainian soldier diving in front of our defence editor in the thick snow as explosions are heard in the distance.

A Ukrainian soldier later showed off his trophies of enemy kills to Jerome as they stood in the trenches.

The soldier could be seen standing in the blizzard holding up a collection of patches he claimed to have taken from slain Russian troops.

14,1q1jqbJM2v4,CNN,Corporations halt donations to GOP who voted to overturn elections,2021-01-11T16:09:39Z,25,"Some of America's biggest companies are suspending donations to Republican Congress members who objected to the Electoral College's votes.
The growing list of those corporations, including BlueCross BlueShield, Citigroup (C), Commerce Bank and Marriott (MAR), comes after a pro-Trump mob breached the US Capitol last Wednesday to fight against the ceremonial counting of electoral votes that confirmed President-elect Joe Biden's win.
147 Republicans voted against certification of the electoral votes in a joint session of Congress last Wednesday evening. They included Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, among hundreds other congress members.
""At the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, we continuously evaluate our political contributions to ensure that those we support share our values and goals,"" said Kim Keck, BlueCross BlueShield's president and CEO, in a statement. ""In light of this week's violent, shocking assault on the United States Capitol, and the votes of some members of Congress to subvert the results of November's election by challenging Electoral College results, BCBSA will suspend contributions to those lawmakers who voted to undermine our democracy.""
The health insurance company's BLUEPAC political action committee -- supported only by employee contributions -- donated $246,750 to Republican lawmakers during the 2020 cycle. That included $10,000 to Sen. Tuberville, $1,000 to Sen. Marshall and $500 to Sen. Hawley.
BlueCross BlueShield said it's stopping donations to all 147 Republicans who challenged the Electoral College results.

Born in Iran, now a Dane, Ellie struggles to understand why her once friendly country has pulled up the welcome mat. Hamish Macdonald explores a nation with an identity crisis.

It’s one of the most open and equal countries in the world. Denmark has long had a reputation for welcoming migrants and protecting its minorities. But these days there are fractures in this once cohesive society. Its mood of tolerance has shifted and now migrants feel on the outer. 

‘When do you feel Danish? What is Danish?’, asks actress and comedian Ellie Jokar, who arrived in Denmark from Iran with her family when she was four. Now she feels she lives in a no man’s land.

""I define myself as a grey zone kid because people like me are not accepted by the Danes and not accepted by the Muslims.”  

In recent years, the government has passed a hundred laws which place strict controls on immigrants: they’ve frozen the intake of refugees, banned the burqa in public and made it mandatory for children of migrants to attend Danish cultural training from the age of one. 

The laws are some of the most draconian in Europe and have the backing of both sides of politics. Some areas with large immigrant populations have been designated as ‘ghettos’, where you get double the punishment for a crime.   

Foreign Correspondent reporter Hamish Macdonald travels through Denmark in midsummer and takes the temperature of a country in the middle of an identity crisis.

He meets a far-right politician whose provocative stunts include throwing around the Koran and who often needs a police entourage when he appears in public. He wants all Muslims deported.

Hamish visits a young Muslim woman who’s been driven indoors by the burqa ban, and he has lunch with the local councillor who’s making pork compulsory on the menu at restaurants and schools in his area.

“If you want to be integrated and accepted, they must also accept the way we live”, he says.

Hamish also takes a ride in Ellie’s pink taxi – made famous in her hit YouTube show – where she interviews Danes from all sides of the political fence, using humour to navigate and explore the cultural divide.

“I meet people that are different than me…and I try to get to the bottom of, how did they become extreme Muslims? Extremist right wing?”, she says. But Ellie is increasingly worried about the growing divisions in her country and longs for strong leaders who can build bridges.

‘So the Danes are over here. The Muslims are over here and…they don't really know how to communicate’.

More than three years of war in the 1990s devastated Bosnia after the fall of Yugoslavia. Tens of thousands of people were killed and hundreds of thousands were driven from their homes by ethnic cleansing.

The war ended in 1995 with a peace treaty that split the country into two parts: a Bosniak Muslim and Croat federation - and the other a Serb entity called Republika Srpska.

Now an ongoing political crisis and the resurgence of Serb nationalism under Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodic, is stirring up fears of renewed conflict.

""There was no shelling in the city for the last five days,"" the mayor of Kharkiv, Ihor Terekhov, told the BBC.

RELATED: Zelenskyy appeals to European Union for 'immediate' membership https://bit.ly/3tfqgdo

Residential areas in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, were being pounded by Russian shells while a massive 40-mile convoy of Russian tanks and vehicles rolled toward the capital of Kyiv on Tuesday as the war entered its sixth day.

At least 11 people were killed and 35 wounded in the rocket strikes on Kharkiv, Interior Ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said. He said the rubble was still being cleared and the death toll was expected to rise.

Closed-circuit television footage showed a fireball engulfing a street in front of one building, and a few cars rolled out of the billowing smoke.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the attack on the city's main square “frank, undisguised terror. Nobody will forgive. Nobody will forget. This attack on Kharkiv is a war crime.”

As leader of the Communist colossus, he commands the world’s attention, but who is China’s strongman and what is his agenda?

Born into the privileged life of a princeling, banished to poverty in the countryside during a political purge, his early life formed and framed his views on power and control.

His rise up the political ladder was propelled by party connections and an advantageous celebrity marriage. As he rose through the party ranks, he carefully crafted his image. 

Today it’s a full-blown cult of personality featuring compulsory lessons in “Xi Jinping Thought”.

China specialists say that the country has already fundamentally re-written the international rule book. The question is, how will the rest of the world respond?

In Irpin, just outside Kyiv, at least three members of a family - including children - were killed.

To the south, renewed Russian shelling forced the Red Cross to abandon a second attempt to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people trapped in the besieged city of Mariupol. 

President Zelenskyy appealed to the West again to enforce a no-fly zone, something they have refused to do, but today US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said they have given the green light to Nato countries to provide fighter jets to Ukraine.

Diplomatic efforts are continuing to defuse the crisis.

760,uk4QzlQTD7g,DW News,"Ukraine still in control of major cities, Belarus could support invasion with troops | DW News",2022-02-28T07:54:35Z,25,"Notwithstanding its overwhelming advantages, the Russian military campaign in Ukraine is meeting stiffer-than-expected resistance from Ukrainian forces. What could the next stage look like? The Kremlin has declined to comment on details of the military operation, and its Defense Ministry is adamant that the campaign has been successful. A senior US defense official said there were indications that in the last 24 hours Moscow had become frustrated by slow progress due to the unexpectedly strong Ukrainian defense and failure to achieve complete air dominance. The UK's Ministry of Defense tweeted that Russian military progress was stalling. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, notes that Ukrainian resistance remains highly effective, despite the Russians' huge advantage in firepower.

Analysts say that the Russian military leadership has been taken by surprise by the lack of impact its aerial campaign is having. ""The Russian forces have a hard time suppressing the air defense and aerospace forces of Ukraine and Ukrainian forces,"" Mathieu Boulegue, a research fellow with the Russia and Eurasia Program at Chatham House, a London-based think tank, told DW. The Pentagon believes that Russia has currently moved at least 50% of its forces into Ukraine out of an estimated 150,000 troops amassed at the border. It's not just the regular army making inroads against the Russian forces but also volunteers who have formed militias and are arming themselves with home-made Molotov cocktails, setting up road blocks and removing road signs to confuse Russian troops.
Most analysts predict that the current war phase is just the first stage of a multi-pronged tactic and that the Russian military will now broaden the campaign.

761,KQeJHL6dXu4,DW News,Germany decides to send weapons from its military to Ukraine | DW News,2022-02-26T19:41:48Z,25,"The German military will send 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 ""Stinger"" class surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine amid the ongoing Russian invasion, the government announced. Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said the weapons would be delivered as soon as possible to support the Ukrainian military. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it was Germany's ""duty to support Ukraine to the best of its ability in defending itself against the invading army of Vladimir Putin.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised Germany's decision to send weapons, in a major reversal of policy for Berlin. ""Keep it up, Chancellor Olaf Scholz! Anti-war coalition in action!"" Zelenskyy tweeted. 

Earlier Saturday Berlin authorized NATO partners the Netherlands and Estonia arms deliveries to Ukraine. For the Netherlands, 400 German-made anti-tank weapons are involved, while Estonia was granted approval to sent artillery from old GDR (East German) stocks. 

The move marks a major change of course for Germany, which had until now refused the delivery of lethal weapons to Ukraine due to its policy of not sending weapons to a conflict zone.

The Netherlands also said it would sent anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, according to the Dutch defense ministry.

747,9RnjVFZoHuc,The New York Times,Watch Bryce Dallas Howard’s Slow Escape in ‘Jurassic World Dominion’ | Anatomy of a Scene,2022-06-17T17:00:05Z,24,"We’ve seen the character Claire Dearing, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, run from dinosaurs while wearing high heels in “Jurassic World.” We’ve seen her climb atop a sleeping T-Rex in “Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.” But her rendezvous with a feathered dino in “Jurassic World Dominion” adds something new to the franchise.

For the first time, Howard gets a harrowing solo sequence with a dinosaur. It’s the Therizinosaurus, a feathered creature that is no less menacing even as an herbivore.

Discussing the moment, the director Colin Trevorrow said about Howard: “I built this sequence that I felt would both showcase her as an actor, her absolute best long-take looks of horrified terror, while also being able to collaborate with her as a director and really understand the intention of every single shot.”

Trevorrow called Howard “one of the most precise and expressive actors. And because she’s also a director, she understands what the scene needs, not just from the perspective of performance, but from filmmaking and craft and form.”

One part of the sequence involves a long take that keeps the focus on Howard as she enters a pond hoping to slowly evade the creature.
“We tried to make sure that the camera was always very, very slowly moving at the same speed,” Trevorrow said. “So it had that same sense of heaviness and weight to it.”

Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog

In just two and a half months, the war in Ukraine has claimed tens of thousands of lives and flattened countless communities. 

The intensity of this struggle has shocked many, even those military professionals across the world who now find themselves watching, trying to understand what lessons to draw about war and its future conduct.

How long could this conflict continue? Could we see a WWI stalemate? Are we witnessing the death of the tank?

Newsnight’s diplomatic and defence editor Mark Urban has been scouring Russian and Ukrainian accounts online and speaking to expert observers to discover more about what those early lessons might be.

This film was produced by Louis Harris-White.

“After her cringeworthy performance in recent weeks, she had the opportunity to redeem herself during a vitally important trip to Poland and Romania as Russia's invasion of Ukraine plunges the region into a deepening crisis. The White House said her visit will demonstrate the strength and unity of the NATO Alliance,” Ms Panahi said.

“What it actually did was demonstrate the utter ineptitude of the vice president.

“You might be wondering what prompted that mad cackling during such a serious press conference, was there perhaps a moment of lightness during such a dark time. Well, no, that embarrassing performance was prompted by a serious question about the unfolding refugee crisis. ”

Ms Harris' laughter occurred after she was asked if the US would make a specific allocation for Ukrainian refugees. 

""It's little wonder that Ukrainian President Zelensky's former press secretary said this of Kamala after that chuckle happy performance with the Polish president,” Ms Panahi said.

""'It would be a tragedy if this woman won the presidency'.""  

“Never mind winning it, the fear is she'll be installed president during Biden's first term should the 79-year-old's health decline further. 

“But put the mad chucking to one side – Kamala Harris' incompetence and complete lack of foreign policy acumen was on display every time she actually answered a question. 

“Kamala Harris is proof of what can happen when you disregard meritocracy and embrace identity politics – Kamala is what happens when you choose people for key roles not according to their ability, experience or acumen but according to their gender or their skin colour.”",2734295.0,71453,23133,PT4M58S

China has warned it will take Taiwan by force if necessary, while US military strategists are now mapping out war games to predict the impacts of a conflict.  

They forecast it could become a brutal regional war, with casualties and carnage on a scale not seen since WWII.   

It’s increasingly becoming a question of when – not if – China will launch an assault. Experts say it could be as early as 2025.  

And Australia would play a key role in the conflict as it spills across the Pacific.  

The investigation reveals how the US has been quietly building up its military assets in northern Australia, including plans to deploy nuclear capable B-52 bombers south of Darwin.  

There are now fears that relationship could pull Australia deeper into any future conflict.

131,JuOWoGpqg1I,BBC News,Lukashenko says he could launch Russian nuclear weapons - BBC News,2023-07-06T23:25:42Z,25,"The President of Belarus has suggested that he could use tactical nuclear weapons, which are being deployed in his country by Russia.

Alexander Lukashenko is a close ally of the Russian President Vladimir Putin and his country served as a launchpad for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Recently President Putin announced that Russian nuclear weapons had been deployed in Belarus.  He said they would only be used if the Russian state or its territory was threatened. 

Speaking to the BBC’s Russia Editor Steve Rosenberg, the Belarus President Lukashenko insisted that he could launch the weapons if he chose to.   He said:  “In Ukraine a whole army is fighting with foreign weapons, with NATO weapons. So why can’t I fight with someone else’s?”

Mr Lukashenko also said that the leader of the Wagner mercenary group Yevgeny Prigozhin was in Russia.   The Wagner leader hasn’t been seen since he staged a mutiny against Russia’s military leadership.    

Clive Myrie presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Steve Rosenberg in Minsk and Gordon Corera in Kyiv.

2133,xZSa4B37sZs,ABC News In-depth,Breaking the Calabrian Mafia in Italy | Foreign Correspondent,2022-04-21T10:00:12Z,25,"For years, a ruthless mafia has ruled Calabria through intimidation and violence. Now prosectuors are taking them on, charging hundreds in one of the biggest trials in decades. But can the Italian state beat the country's most powerful mafia organisation?

The Calabrian mafia began local but over recent decades it's transformed into a powerful, multi-national criminal organisation, with an estimated turnover of 80 billion dollars a year. 

Now Italian prosecutors are running a maxi-trial against members of a family they allege is one of the ‘Ndrangehta’s most powerful clans – the Mancusos.

More than 300 members and associates of the Mancusos have been arrested.

The charge sheet is sobering. It includes murder, extortion, drug trafficking and money laundering.

In this gripping crime saga, Fran Kelly travels to Vibo Valentia to tell the story of this historic attempt to curb the power of the ‘Ndrangheta.

She gains access to the man leading the trial, Chief Prosecutor Nicola Gratteri. He’s  been investigating the Calabrian mafia for decades and has long been on the mafia’s kill list. 

“There’s always tension. There’s always fear and you must always be careful”, he tells Kelly as he drives to court surrounded by his security motorcade. “You have to tame fear and talk to death.” 

Kelly speaks with community members who now feel emboldened to speak out against the mafia.

‘The number of people turning on the mafia has increased’, says anti-mafia activist Giuseppe Borrello. ‘It’s new for Vibo Valentia.”

Gratteri’s actions have given hope to Sara Scarpulla, whose son was blown up in a car bomb organised by a member of the Mancuso family.

Kelly also speaks to an anti-mafia prosecutor in Milan, Italy’s financial heart, where the ‘Ndrangheta has established a strong presence. 

In Calabria, not everyone in the community is rallying behind Nicola Gratteri’s maxi-trial. 

“There’s vicious mudslinging aimed at the Prosecutor’s Office’, explains lawyer Giovanna Fronte. “That’s how the ‘Ndrangheta operates.”

For the people of Vibo Valentia, the maxi-trial has raised hopes of a new chapter in which the State regains control of a land long thought lost to organised crime.  
 
But can these prosecutions uproot the powerful networks of the ‘Ndrangheta?

Ukraine's delegation is set to meet Russian representatives for the first talks since Moscow's invasion, as the fighting for several Ukrainian cities continues and the Russian rouble collapses. ""The Ukrainian delegation arrived at the Ukrainian-Belarusian border to take part in talks with representatives of the Russian Federation,"" the Ukrainian presidency said in a statement. ""The key issue of the talks is an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of troops from Ukraine."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a separate statement urged Russian troops to abandon their equipment and leave the battlefield in order to save their lives, claiming that more than 4,500 Russian soldiers had already lost their lives. He also urged the European Union to give Ukraine ""immediate"" membership, via a special procedure. Russian state media posted videos of Ukrainian delegates arriving to the talks by helicopter.

Russian forces have taken over the towns of Berdyansk and Enerhodar in Ukraine's southeastern Zaporizhzhya region as well as the area around the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, Interfax quoted Russia's defence ministry as saying on Monday. The plant's operations continued normally, it said. Meanwhile, Britain's defense ministry said that Russia's advance on Kyiv has been slowed by logistical failures and fierce Ukrainian resistance. ""The bulk of [President Vladimir] Putin's ground forces remain more than 30km [18.6 miles] to the north of Kyiv their advance having been slowed by Ukrainian forces defending Hostomel airfield, a key Russian objective for day one of the conflict,"" the ministry said. ""Logistical failures and staunch Ukrainian resistance continue to frustrate the Russian advance."" The Ukrainian military also accused Russia of launching a missile strike on residential buildings in the cities of Zhytomyr and Chernigiv, cities in the country's northwest and north. ""At the same time, all attempts by the Russian invaders to achieve the goal of the military operation failed,"" the military said. ""The enemy is demoralized and bears heavy losses,"" it claimed.

Kyiv’s troops were sheltering in a trench near Mala Tokmachka when the shell exploded. The unit narrowly avoided a direct hit that would have killed them all. But the blast caused part of the trench wall to collapse, burying one soldier completely. Fortunately his comrades were able to quickly dig him out of the dirt. Mala Tokmachka has been the focus of Ukraine’s counter-attack in the south.cIt was here that a failed attack led to the destruction of dozens of Western vehicles. Ukraine is continuing to advance despite heavy resistance, but slower than anticipated.

Explorers making the first manned voyage to the Titanic wreckage in more than a decade said they had uncovered a partial collapse of the ship's hull and that the Captain’s quarters had also deteriorated heavily.

Nearly 13,125ft (4,000m) beneath the surface of the Atlantic Ocean, in water at a bitterly cold one degree, salt corrosion and metal-eating bacteria have worn away parts of the liner's structure.

The team of divers found that the hull near the officers' quarters on the starboard side of the ship has started to collapse, taking with it the vessel's luxurious stateroom accommodation, according to exploration company Caladan Oceanic.

And yet his life had begun in a very contemporary fashion - an infant refugee from the country of his birth, carried by boat across the Mediterranean. He was also the man who modernised the monarchy, encouraging interaction with ordinary people - an approach embraced by his grandsons. But throughout all those years, he told anyone who would listen that his central role was to support the Queen. And it was a mutual reliance. Elizabeth has described Philip as her ""strength and stay"" and said she and the country owed him a debt greater than he would ever claim ""or we would ever know"".

Jon Snow looks back now on the life and times of Philip Mountbatten.

1019,6k70Cy6UW_A,The Telegraph,Costa Concordia: New video of the inside of sunken cruise ship,2014-07-03T15:19:13Z,25,"Days before salvage workers attempt the historic task of refloating the marooned Costa Concordia, newly released video has revealed the ghostly world -- frozen in time -- deep inside the luxury cruise ship. 

Police divers entering the 950 foot vessel, which smashed into rocks on the Italian island of Giglio in 2012, have captured startling footage of shredded metal work and eerie staircases, shops and corridors, as well as drifting possessions and furniture. 

The video is a snap shot of the panic struck last moments of the Costa Concordia as 4,200 passengers and crew fled and 32 drowned, while the holed ship tilted onto shallow rocks.

As Russian troops retreated, recently, they abandoned huge amounts of equipment, including battle tanks.

And as our correspondent John Ray reports, it's all being salvaged and put to good use.

Death and destruction on the ground in Ukraine. A massive exodus of refugees. Scenes of fierce resistance from Ukrainian soldiers and ordinary people - and a President who's rallied much of the world around his cause. Meanwhile Russia has become increasingly isolated and its economy is in freefall. We take a closer look back now at the events of the past week.
And the United Nations General Assembly has adopted a resolution demanding Russia immediately stops using force against Ukraine and withdraws its military from the country.   
The historic non-binding resolution was backed by 141 out of 193 member states - with only five countries voting against. Before the vote, Ukraine's ambassador to the UN accused Russia of seeking to commit genocide in his country, and called on the world to stand together against Moscow's aggression.

CBS reporter Weijia Jiang, who is Asian-American, asked Trump why he was emphasising that the US was doing better than any other country when it comes to testing.

He told CBS reporter Jiang to ""ask China"" in response to her question at a White House press conference.

Why does that matter? Why is this a global competition to you if every day Americans are still losing their lives and we are still seeing more cases every day?” she asked.

“Well, they are losing their lives everywhere in the world,” Trump said. “Maybe that is a question you should ask China. Don’t ask me. Ask China that question. When you ask China that question you may get a very unusual answer.”

Environmental documentary film, ‘The Planet of the Humans,' absolutely “skewers the renewable energy industry,” Mr Kenny said. 

“The film goes on to attack major corporations for their pretense, their virtue-signalling on renewable energy”. 

Mr Kenny said the stance taken in the documentary is “kinda strange” given the executive producer is Michael Moore, who is a “millionaire, leftist, academy award winning director”. 

Mr Kenny said, “why isn't the ABC talking about this, showing this, debating this?”

“They usually love Mike Moore's films; they usually love to promote the political films of the green left”. 

“This one goes too far for them of course, it attacks renewables and it attacks climate alarmists that they regard as secular saints, like Al Gore”.

Nearly 80% of Americans have been exposed to Covid misinfo, and many don't know what to believe, survey says
By Brian Stelter and Virginia Langmaid, CNN Business

New York (CNN Business)The information landscape about Covid-19 is bewildering, with factual and fictional claims competing for attention. And most American adults have heard at least a couple of the fictions, according to new data from the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Kaiser, which is widely respected for its top-notch work on this subject, tested eight false statements about Covid. Nearly 80% of Americans surveyed said they had heard of at least one of the falsehoods and either believed it or are unsure whether it is true.

""Most commonly,"" the report's authors wrote, ""six in ten adults have heard that the government is exaggerating the number of Covid-19 deaths by counting deaths due to other factors as coronavirus deaths and either believe this to be true (38%) or aren't sure if it's true or false (22%).""

One-third of respondents ""believe or are unsure whether deaths due to the Covid-19 vaccine are being intentionally hidden by the government (35%),"" the authors wrote, ""and about three in ten each believe or are unsure whether Covid-19 vaccines have been shown to cause infertility (31%) or whether Ivermectin is a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 (28%).""

The researchers also found that ""between a fifth and a quarter of the public believe or are unsure whether the vaccines can give you COVID-19 (25%), contain a microchip (24%), or can change your DNA (21%).""

TThe Queen 's lying in state has now officially finished ahead of her funeral today, with an estimated 400,000 mourners thought to have passed through Westminster Hall over the past five days. The final people were admitted to the line to see the Queen's coffin at about 10.30pm last night, which gave them time to make it through before the closure at 6.30am this morning. The line was opened at 5pm last Wednesday. The last member of the public to be allowed in was Christina Heerey, who serves in the Royal Air Force. Members of parliamentary staff then followed her, with Black Rod Sarah Clarke the last person to walk past the coffin.

The Russian invasion has been hampered by stiff Ukrainian resistance and logistical issues.

Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg also said Russia's war in Ukraine is not going to plan and that its attempt to capture the eastern Donbas region has ""stalled"".

""They failed to take Kyiv, they are pulling back from around Kharkiv, their major offensive in Donbas has stalled. Russia is not achieving its strategic objectives,"" he said.

Stoltenberg added that Ukraine could win the conflict.

For years, soldiers from Chechnya have been fighting alongside pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. 
Chechen separatists fought two wars against Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union. But Russia violently defeated the separatists. Now, Chechnya is part of the Russian Federation and is ruled by Ramzan Kadyrov - a loyal ally of President Vladimir Putin. 
Putin has repeatedly called upon Kadyrov's paramilitary fighters to undertake risky missions in Ukraine. But some Chechen separatists have also joined the war - fighting against Russian forces.

Islamic State is set to be driven out of its last remaining territories in Iraq and Syria—but its defeat won't spell the end for terrorism.

Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.trib.al/rWl91R7 

What will be the seismic shifts in the year ahead? The appearance of this outfit convulsed world politics for several years; struck fear into the hearts of people all around the world. Islamic State is the most vicious and murderous jihardist regime the world has ever seen. 

In 2017, it will be smashed. The defeat of Islamic State will be one of the most significant things to happen in 2017. Forces from some 60 countries have taken the fight to Islamic State. It now clings to two key strongholds, one in Iraq and one in Syria.

Controlling territory is what defines Islamic State. Recruits have been drawn from all over the world to fight for its declared domain.

In October 2016, an Iraqi-led force launched a concerted effort to reclaim Mosul. The city is set to fall within months with the Syrian stronghold of Raqqa and a few remaining pockets likely to follow shortly after. But many of the fighters themselves may outlast Islamic State.

For the west too it may prove a pyrrhic victory

‘Be nice. Don’t be threatening,’ Trump told reporter Yamiche Alcindor.

The disaster area in Germany spans more than 100 kilometers near the border with the Netherlands and Belgium, where the district of Ahrweiler was the worst hit. A massive clean-up operation is underway as rescue crews search for survivors. More than a thousand people are still missing.
Destruction and debris on every corner
The only sound on the streets:  Mud being scraped away, and tractors rumbling through the once picturesque town of Ahrweiler.
In Ahrweiler the water has now subsided and it's only now the true extent of the damage caused by the floods is really coming to light. A lot of people are returning to their homes for the first time.""
The scenes are devastating for those returning. 
Volunteers, family and friends have travelled far and wide to Ahrweiler to help those affected.
They're here clearing homes, or supplying people with the basics. 
Many locals right now want financial help from the state: quickly and with as little red tape as possible.
Further north, in Erftstadt, a donation bank at a school has been overwhelmed with clothes and food.
Some locals evacuated from Erftstadt this week are also being sheltered at the school. 
Many feel left in the dark.
For many of those affected, that question could takes weeks, months...if not years to be answered.
While some German towns begin to assess the damage and clean up, others further south are being hit by new flooding. In the southeast, in Saxony, rail lines are closed due to rising waters. A state of emergency has been declared in parts of the state of Bavaria. Across the border in Austria, flooding and heavy rains are causing serious damage. 
In the town of Hallein, close to the German border, a flash flood has swept through the streets. People living there had already been warned to be careful, and avoid going into their basements.
Other parts of Europe have also been badly affected by the floods. Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated in southern parts of the Netherlands.  And Belgium is also counting the cost: At least 27 people died there. The region around the Meuse river was worst affected by what authorities are calling an ""unprecedented"" deluge of water.
The floods have receded from the streets of Pepinster -  leaving the mud behind. Residents are toiling to reclaim their homes -  hoping that the rain holds off. Days of heavy downpours turned this gentle stream into a raging torrent. 
Houses along the riverbank overwhelmed by the force of the water. Cars were swept off the roads.
Residents are in shock.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen came to take stock of the damage - and is promising long term help.
Outside assistance is welcome in Pepinster, but the community is pulling together to get through the worst. The water is on its way out. But it will be a long before things get back to normal.

963,do0PKIr0YbQ,The Sun,In Full: Kevin McCarthy & GOP visit US-Mexico border ICE facility amid border crisis,2021-03-15T18:37:35Z,25,"McCarthy & GOP visit US-Mexico border and ICE facilityy in El Paso.

Last week House Republicans held a news 'Joe Biden Border Crisis' conference on US President's failing border policies.

The US Department of Homeland Security over the weekend ordered an emergency agency that usually responds to floods, storms, and other major disasters to help care for a growing number of migrant children arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, has been instructed to help receive, shelter, and transport children over the next 90 days.

The move signals the scope of a growing humanitarian and political crisis for President Joe Biden, who has reversed some of the restrictive border policies of his predecessor, Donald Trump.

A spike in children arriving without parents or legal guardians has exceeded shelter capacity, which was previously cut by 40% to limit the spread of COVID-19.

Those shelter restrictions were lifted on March 5th, but only about 200 beds have come back online, an administration official said Friday (March 12).

Migrant children apprehended at the border are supposed to be transferred out of Border Patrol custody within 72 hours. But when shelter space is limited, they can get stuck in border detention centers for longer periods - as is happening now.

A U.S. official told Reuters that more than 3,600 migrant children were being held in U.S. border facilities as of the end of last week, more than four times the number in late February.

And as of Friday, the Department of Health and Human Services’ refugee office had approximately 8,800 unaccompanied children in custody.

On the night of the US presidential election, Donald Trump declared the vote was a ""major fraud on the American people."" Rather than face defeat, he and his allies began a campaign claiming the election had been stolen.
 
In the aftermath, high profile Fox News presenters gave a platform to Trump's campaign pouring fuel on the already ferocious political divide.
 
Now, their words and actions are under scrutiny in multi-billion dollar lawsuits. Election software companies Dominion and Smartmatic sued Fox News for its coverage of false claims the 2020 presidential election was rigged.
 
In an exclusive interview, Trump’s former lawyer and advocate of the 'stolen election' conspiracy, Sidney Powell, is asked to justify her claims.

769,myaYXWehFRQ,DW News,Ukrainians fight back against Russians on Kyiv outskirts | DW News,2022-02-26T09:30:00Z,25,"Ukrainian forces have been fighting back against Russian assaults on the outskirts of Kyiv. Authorities have urged citizens to help defend the capital. 
Guns are being handed out to ordinary citizens and people are being urged to make petrol bombs and resist. Ukraine's military says it repelled an assault by Russian troops on army base in Kyiv. And now we're seeing some of the latest damage here.
A missile hit an apartment building located just minutes away from Kyiv's secondary international airport. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko says the strike injured 35 people, including two children. Russia's military says it has launched a barrage of cruise missiles against Ukraine.
In Kyiv, many residents have taken shelter where they can. The government has handed out thousands of guns to ordinary citizens and is urging them to build petrol bombs to resist.
And Russia has vetoed a draft UN Security Council resolution that condemned its invasion of Ukraine and called on Moscow to withdraw troops immediately. 11 countries on the 15-member council voted in favor, while India, China, and the United Arab Emirates abstained.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeated a call to Ukrainian soldiers to surrender - making baseless accusations against the Ukrainian government and invoking the name of a controversial wartime nationalist leader.
And many of those caught up in the invasion have fled to neighboring countries. The UN says more than 50,000 Ukrainian refugees have left since Thursday.
Most are headed to countries neighboring Ukraine. They include EU members Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, as well as non-EU member Moldova. As fighting worsens, these countries are bracing for more refugees in the coming days.

770,JePpvYwuk3Q,DW News,Why was Russia’s invasion of Ukraine such a miscalculation? | Ukraine latest,2022-03-24T22:33:20Z,25,"Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Facebook that a total of 3,343 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities via humanitarian corridors on Thursday. She said 2,717 people managed to leave Mariupol, which is under siege by Russia. Vereshchuk claimed that Russian forces had prevented humanitarian aid convoys from entering Mariupol.

Ukrainian lawmakers voted overwhelming in support of a measure to punish citizens who help Russian forces. Ukrainian collaborators could face up to 12 years in prison for ""intentional activities aimed at aiding the aggressor state,"" a statement on Ukraine's parliament website said. Collaborators could also be temporarily disbarred from government positions and their assets may be taken away. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said that the battlefront is ""practically frozen."" He said Russian forces are ""practically at a standstill"" and claimed Russian troops lack the resources to advance their offensive. Arestovych said Russian forces face shortages of fuel, ammunition and rations. He said Russia has switched its tactics from offense to defense, but this statement has not been confirmed by reports on the ground.

New alliances are being formed that until recently would have been unimaginable. But as the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and, potentially, Sudan forge closer relationships with Israel, where does this leave the Palestinians, particularly those in Gaza? How is Hamas - the elected government of Gaza - and its paramilitary wing, the Qassam Brigades, adjusting to the new regional political climate? In this film, Al Jazeera Arabic’s Tamer Almisshal meets Hamas’s political leader Ismail Haniya and discovers dramatic and surprising military preparations that may seriously concern Israel and its allies.

Today, the Gaza Strip is blockaded by the two countries bordering Gaza, Israel and Egypt, but it somehow continues to obtain rocket technology, some of it homemade, some smuggled in. Tamer Almisshal has obtained video of rockets being manufactured in Gaza. Iran is cited as a likely supplier but the source of some of this weaponry is unexpected. While clearing damage from the 2014 Gaza War, the Qassam Brigades came across unexploded Israeli missiles and say they have repurposed them into a source of arms. Hamas explains how another arms supply was sourced by a specialist unit of Palestinian divers, who were tasked with searching the seabed for weaponry and who claim to have recovered projectiles from the hold of century-old sunken ships.

In his daily video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian strikes on Thursday were an attempt to ""humiliate"" the global organization.

Such concerns are not just about America's security, but also its insecurity. Read more here: https://econ.st/2O9kgyc

Rarely does a country go to war with a private company. But America has done just that. But is this really about Huawei or is it something bigger than that? And what is the threat? 

What is this war really about and why is Huawei in the middle of it?

Founded in China in 1987 Huawei is now the world’s largest maker of telecoms equipment with revenues exceeding $103bn. When you think about Huawei you might think about the handset. That makes sense, since it sold 200m of them in 2018 alone. But close to half of its revenue comes from selling network equipment. In fact, since 2014 it’s outgrown all its competitors reaching over 3bn people.

This is how networks function - Your phone sends a signal to a nearby tower using radio waves, voice and data are passed over an internal network run by your phone company, which connects your handset to other phone users and the wider internet. In other words, these antennas connect us all. But now, there’s a new kind of network. Although 5G is massively overhyped, it is coming and Huawei is a leading force in this innovation. But though this computerised, smart future opens up new possibilities it comes with a health warning. Because if entire networks are vulnerable this opens the door to countries spying on one another.

In a rare interview with The Economist Ren Zhengfei, Huawei’s founder and CEO, talked about the political storm surrounding his company. As the argument rages over the security of Huawei’s products the effects can be seen in some unexpected places. Joe Franell runs Eastern Oregon Telecom, a small network serving the people of this rural area. The problem is that the network here relies on Huawei technology.

It’s a similar story around the world Mobile-phone users in developing countries have benefited from Huawei’s attractive deals. But how is Huawei undercutting its competitors?

Whether or how Huawei is connected to and subsidised by the Chinese government is unclear. But what is clear is this - China is the kind of country where if the party says jump all you can say is, well how high? Loyalty to the state is actually enshrined in China’s intelligence law
Article 7, a 2017 addition, states that “Any organisation or citizen shall support, assist and co-operate with the state intelligence work.” Critics say this law means that when you buy Huawei equipment you may be exposing yourself to surveillance by the Chinese intelligence services. And this makes governments very uncomfortable.

The fear is that Huawei will leave backdoor vulnerabilities in its networks that would provide China with an opportunity to spy on its competitors and enemies. To counter this mistrust, Huawei has shared its code and allowed the likes of Britain’s National Cyber Security Centre
to scan it for backdoors. So, if there’s no solid security threat why is America making an enemy out of Huawei?

It seems as though the concern over Huawei is not only about America’s security but also its insecurity. And it’s causing collateral damage at home as well as abroad. In May 2019 the Trump administration issued an executive order which not only forbade American companies from supplying Huawei with components, but restricted domestic networks from using its equipment. It’s a move that feels like an own goal to Americans like Joe Franell.

And there’s another uncomfortable truth that America can’t ignore. Smartphone technology relies on a truly global supply chain. Take an average smartphone. Some contain components from more than 200 international suppliers. Screens might be made by Samsung in South Korea. The camera lens engineered in Germany. The chip could be designed by a California-based company and manufactured in Taiwan. The battery could come from Japan and the audio chip from China. But increasingly, hostility and lack of trust threaten to fracture these supply chains.

America's concerns about Huawei are understandable. But the risks can be managed by limiting the use of Huawei equipment to less sensitive parts of 5G networks. That way it is possible to benefit from the low cost of Huawei’s equipment while minimising security concerns.

Billions of people around the world have benefited from increased connectivity made possible by global standards and global supply chains. But if political mistrust divides the telecoms industry into rival camps
everybody stands to lose

25,bm_BUaISFsc,CNN,Top US general: What's at stake is greater than Ukraine,2022-04-26T19:05:10Z,25,"General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, discusses the stakes of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the wider global implications with CNN's Jim Sciutto.  

Why Russia's Ukraine aggression matters to Americans
by Zachary B. Wolf

Nobody knows for sure exactly what Vladimir Putin is doing with around 100,000 Russian troops parked near the Russia-Ukraine border, but it's making the US and Europe extremely nervous.

President Joe Biden said this week he expected the Russians would ""move in"" and that a slight incursion would be met differently than a full-on invasion.

The US has spent the past few days cleaning up that remark and making clear any type of invasion is unacceptable.

Asked in Geneva by a reporter if he thought, like Biden, that an invasion was likely, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov used some interesting language.

""Unless the United States doesn't go to bed with Ukraine, I don't think so,"" Lavrov said.
What does it mean for countries to 'go to bed'? All of this high-stakes geopolitical chess, then, comes down to how intimate the US gets with Ukraine in the eyes of Russia.

267,ocVFTq6RW38,Al Jazeera English,Trump’s America: Great again or big failure? | Head to Head,2019-10-04T07:51:56Z,25,"In this episode of Head to Head, Mehdi Hasan asks Donald Trump's senior economic adviser Stephen Moore about ""Trumponomics"", the US president’s leadership style, and racism.

Trump has made promises to more than double previous economic growth, revive industries like coal, and slash the debt and the deficit. But has he delivered? The national debt is now skyrocketing to levels not seen since World War II and the trade war with China has experts fearing a global recession.

""Trump makes grandiose promises,"" Moore told Hasan. ""He exaggerates and sometimes I wish he wouldn’t do that. But if you compare where the economy is today versus where it was when he entered office, it’s substantially stronger.""

Moore, a conservative commentator and economist at the Heritage Foundation, is also an adviser to the Trump 2020 re-election campaign.

He told Hasan he helped write immigration legislation, referring to a bill supported by President Trump and introduced by Republican senators. Moore, however, said he does not agree with some of the government’s positions on immigration.

When challenged on policies limiting legal immigration and the dire situation in migrant detention centres at the US-Mexico border, Moore said conditions in every centre he visited had been humane.

""But I do believe that until we get the border secure and we get that wall built, once we do that, we can increase our legal immigration.""

When pressed further on the numerous false statements Trump has made, like needing an ID to buy a box of cereal and suggesting that wind turbines cause cancer, Moore said, ""Donald Trump would be better off to stop talking so much and let his record speak for itself"".

""What I'm saying is, what Americans care about is his performance, his results, not what he says and how he acts,"" he added.

This is the first Head to Head episode with an audience recorded in the United States and marks the beginning of a new series. It takes place in front of an audience at the George Washington University in Washington DC.

We are joined by a panel of three experts:

- Tiffany Cross - liberal commentator, co-founder and managing editor of the US news outlet, The Beat DC
- Rick Wilson - former political strategist for the Republican Party, conservative critic of President Trump, and author of Everything Trump Touches Dies
- Jenna Ellis Rives - constitutional lawyer, member of the Trump 2020 Advisory Board, and author of The Legal Basis for a Moral Constitution

In 1967, at the height of the Arab-Israeli Six-Day War, the Israeli Air Force launched an unprovoked attack on the USS Liberty, a US Navy spy ship that was monitoring the conflict from the safety of international waters in the Mediterranean.

Israeli jet fighters hit the vessel with rockets, cannon fire and napalm, before three Israeli torpedo boats moved in to launch a second more devastating attack. Though she did not sink, the Liberty was badly damaged. Thirty-four US servicemen and civilian analysts were killed, another 171 were wounded.

Later Israel apologised for what it claimed to be a tragic case of mistaken identity. It said that it had believed the ship to be hostile Egyptian naval vessel. US President Lyndon Johnson was privately furious but publicly the White House chose not to challenge the word of its closest Middle East ally and accepted that the attack had been a catastrophic accident.

However, as this exclusive Al Jazeera investigation reveals, fresh evidence throws new light on exactly what happened that fateful day – and the remarkable cover up that followed.

Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy 

From ice cream to cakes and even perfume, vanilla is the go-to flavour the world over. In recent years the price of natural vanilla has shot up. At one point it was more expensive than silver by weight.

80% of the world’s vanilla is grown in the perfectly suited climate of the north-east region of Madagascar. It’s the country’s primary export crop. For the farmers, like Beni Odon, life is far sweeter when the vanilla price is high. 

In 2014 vanilla was $80 a kilo. Three years later it was $600. Today it’s around $500. The price rise is due in part to global demand. The trend of eating naturally means that food companies have shunned synthetic flavouring in favour of the real deal. Beni and the other farmers are cashing in.

But things can change very quickly. Price fluctuations affect producers of agricultural commodities everywhere but vanilla is particularly volatile. In just a few weeks the price can jump, or plummet, by over 20%

Liberalisation is one reason for such movements. The Malagasy government once regulated the vanilla industry and its price. But now the price is negotiated at the point of sale which makes for a freer market but a more volatile one. It’s also a tiny industry. A single cyclone can knock out the entire crop within Madagascar. It’s also a difficult and delicate crop to grow.

The growers have to contend with another problem. Thieves are targeting the vanilla crops. Some farmers have resorted to harvesting the beans before they’re ripe but this produces a poorer quality vanilla and ultimately pushes down the price.

The combination of deteriorating quality and high prices is having an effect. The vanilla price bubble may burst. Big buyers that provide vanilla for the likes of Häagen-Dazs and Ben & Jerry’s are now working directly with farmers in a bid to gain greater control over quality. Other companies have started to look elsewhere for their natural vanilla. Indonesia, Uganda and even the Netherlands are growing the crop. For a century Madagascar has enjoyed a near-monopoly on vanilla. But this industry may be in line for a radical overhaul.

European Parliament's Mairead McGuinness gave the group a dressing down, saying: ""Please sit down, resume your flags, put your flags away and take them with you if you're leaving now.""

Mr Farage finished his speech by saying: ""I know you're going to miss us, I know you want to ban our national flags, but we're going to wave you goodbye.""

His Brexit Party MEPs cheered 'hip hip hooray' and gave him a standing ovation.

They were flying on what was then the world's newest, most sophisticated civilian aircraft, powered by prestigious Rolls Royce engines. But six minutes into the flight all that would change, when an explosion sent pieces of searing hot metal shooting out of the engine faster than the speed of sound.

In 2011, Four Corners told the compelling story of the frightening hours that followed.

From the passengers who looked on in horror as a human-sized hole appeared in one wing, to the horrified Qantas staff who tried to verify reports of deaths on the ground as pieces of engine rained down on an Indonesian primary school, ""QF32"" offers a gripping forensic account of a truly terrifying mid-air incident.

2140,Faro2mDRklg,ABC News In-depth,Coronavirus: Inside Italy's COVID-19 Lockdown | Foreign Correspondent,2020-03-24T09:30:13Z,25,"It’s Europe’s coronavirus epicentre with cases of infected rising by up to a thousand daily. Hospitals are full. Patients, young and old, are dying. To control the outbreak, Italy is in lockdown but is it too little too late?

In the province of Lodi, half an hour from northern Italy’s capital Milan, it’s day 23 of the lockdown.

A young couple - Isabella and Roberto - are stuck inside with their 3-year-old daughter Eleonora. They’re wondering when they will be able to resume normal life.

The northern Lombardy region has been dubbed the ground zero of Italy’s corona crisis. So far, over two thousand people have died there and nearly thirty thousand have been infected.

After Lombardy, the virus spread through the north, then nationwide.  
At first, doctors mistook it for the flu. Precious time was lost and now Italy, known for its warm embraces and kisses on both cheeks, has more cases than any country apart from China. 

Hospitals have been swamped. All non-corona related patients’ care has been sidelined. Doctors have been issued with protocols about which patients to prioritise and which not to – a form of disaster medicine.

Desperate to bring the virus under control, Italy has finally taken strong action, declaring a nationwide lockdown. Schools and universities have shut. Shops, cafes and restaurants have closed. Apart from buying groceries, people need official authorisation to move around or else face a fine.

Reporter Emma Alberici can’t travel to Italy but she has relatives and friends there. 

For this special report, Emma taps into her network of family and friends as well as doctors and businesspeople, to tell an intimate story about how families, communities and the country are dealing with this unprecedented health emergency.

We use skype calls, phone diaries, photos and home video to bring you a picture of Italy in lockdown.

In Milan, we meet the head surgeon at one of the city’s major hospitals. He’s isolated at home after contracting the Coronavirus from one of his patients. He explains how he’s being treated for the infection and his fears for his wife, who’s working as an obstetrician.

There’s 7-year-old Zoe, who doing school from her home in Milan. She skypes her Australian friend Livia and they chat and giggle about the virus and hand washing.

We meet Emma’s 90-year-old aunt recently hospitalised with influenza, and her cousin – also Emma Alberici – who’s looking after her mother while holding down a job as CFO of a big pharmaceutical company in Milan – an industry which has special exemption from the lockdown. 

We hear from Isabella and Roberto about the meals they’re cooking and the bread they’re baking.

And we interview virologist Prof Roberto Burioni who warns Australia that this virus is dangerous and must be taken with the utmost seriousness.

This is an intimate insight into an extraordinary moment in history.

1309,pA_YVsQFtaU,euronews,Teen prostitution in Ukraine,2013-05-31T19:58:59Z,25,"Ukraine June 1 marks Children's Day. However, an alarming number of teenage girls, many escaping problems at home, have turned to prostitution. Around 11-15 thousand according to UNICEF. 

The country is also suffering from one of the worst AIDS epidemics in Europe. Teen prostitutes are extremely vulnerable to HIV due to lack of knowledge or access to methods of prevention.

In the Mykolaiv region of Southern Ukraine, the death rate from HIV infection in the 15-24 age group is one of the highest in the country. 

Seventeen-year-old Nataliya explains how she first got involved in sex work.

""My friend has been doing it for 7 years, she told me I could do it too. At first I didn't want to. Now I have enough money. I can help my mom. She doesn't know what I do, not even my friends know,"" she confides.

Nataliya hopes to go on to study medicine, but Yuliya has no plans to quit.

""There aren't so many opportunities to make money in our city. What I do really helps me and I'm OK with it. I also like the fact that now I have someone to ask for advice, to talk to and even listen to that advice in certain situations. But one of the most important things is that I can check my health regularly and talk to a psychologist,"" she notes.

In Mykolaiv, the UNITUS charity works alongside UNICEF to provide healthcare, social services and psychological help to young people at risk of contracting HIV/AIDS.

Out of 350 female clients, most have been tested. Up to 10 per cent have the virus.

""One of the biggest problems is an extremely low level of knowledge and understanding of how HIV is transmitted. And even if people know it, they still do not regard this risk important,"" says Olena Sakovych from UNICEF.

This mobile HIV testing unit can find women most at risk on the streets and provide them with advice and access to a psychologist. 

Studies show that use of mobile units can reduce the numbers infected.

A nurse carrying out an HIV test tells the teenage prostitute:

""When accidents happen and the condom breaks, you have to get a check-up.""

Joe Biden was left empty-handed as he appeared to shake hands with thin air after a speech on the United State’s ongoing supply chain woes.

The 79-year-old President had just finished delivering a nearly 40-minute speech in Greensboro, North Carolina, when he turned to his right and stuck out his hand, despite being alone on the stage.

A number of his political adversaries, including Republic Senator Ted Cruz, seized on Mr Biden’s latest gaffe, using it to question his cognitive state.

Footage of the moment, shared by millions on social media, showed the gaffe-prone President turn to his right, before he appeared to say something into empty space while miming a handshake.

The president took questions from reporters for the first time on Thursday afternoon, but quickly began to make mistakes.

AS he finished answering a question about filibuster, Biden appeared to trail off-thought, ending with a pause, concluding ""anyway.""

""...If you hold near and dear to you that you uh um like to be able to um...."" Biden said, before concluding ""anyway.""

Biden then closed his eyes and appeared to struggle to form the next sentence.

However, after seconds of confusion, he quickly told reassured viewers ""we're ready to get a lot done.""

He then appeared to call out a name from a list of White House reporters who were quizzing the president.

Going back to his list at a later point of the conference, Biden asked ""where am I"" before asking CNN's Kaitlan Collins for another question.

772,u3ZwTbhTkQE,DW News,Ukraine reportedly battling Russian troops on the outskirts of Kyiv | DW News,2022-02-25T12:46:30Z,25,"Russian forces would enter areas outside Kyiv on Friday, a top Ukrainian defense official has said. Ukraine's president called on the international community to help his country.

Explosions were heard in Ukraine's second-largest city Kharkiv, which lies close to Ukraine's eastern border with Russia, on Friday with the mayor telling residents to seek shelter from Russian missiles in subway stations, basements and bomb shelters, Reuters news agency reported. Air raid sirens were set off in cities across the country as reports emerged of rockets landing in residential areas.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Friday that Russia wanted to ""liberate Ukrainians from oppression,"" adding that the invading force is not planning to occupy Ukraine, Reuters reported.
The aim of the invasion, according to Lavrov, is to demilitarize Ukraine. He went on to say that Russia wants the Ukrainian people to be independent and determine their own destiny. Lavrov added that Moscow would engage in talks with Kyiv, but only after the Ukrainian military laid down its weapons. 
The Kremlin on Friday also pledged to retaliate to Western sanctions. It acknowledged that sanctions would be damaging, but that the problems they may cause would be solvable. ""It goes without saying that retaliatory measures will follow,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. ""Just how symmetrical or asymmetrical they will be depends on the analysis, the restrictions have yet to be analysed,"" he added. The comments from the Kremlin came as the EU announced that it was preparing further emergency sanctions against Russia.

269,U0Xn60Zw03A,Al Jazeera English,Dawkins on religion: Is religion good or evil? | Head to Head,2012-12-23T07:44:44Z,25,"With the headlines covering fanaticism, fundamentalism, superstition and ignorance, religion is getting a bad press these days. And much of the conflict in the world, from the Middle East to Nigeria and Myanmar, is often blamed on religion.

But how are things from a different perspective? Some defenders of religion claim Adolf Hitler was an atheist. Communism under Joseph Stalin, Pol Pot or Mao Zedong banned religion, but also massacred millions. And science brought incredible and amazing advances, but also pollution and the atomic bomb.

A critic of religious dogmatism, Professor Richard Dawkins revolutionised genetics in 1976 with the publication of The Selfish Gene. He has since written 12 more bestsellers, including The God Delusion which sold millions of copies, was translated into more than 30 languages, and catapulted him to the position of the world's foremost atheist.

Mehdi Hasan challenges evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins at the Oxford Union in front of a varied and lively audience.

In a frank and at times heated exchange, they discuss: Is religion a force for good or evil? Can it co-exist with science? Is science the new religion? And why if god does not exist, is religion so persistent?

 At 1.24 am, an engineer recorded in his diary that the protective system was not working. At the same moment, a huge and catastrophic surge in power caused two explosions. 

As fires raged, the core of reactor number four was destroyed. A huge cloud rose into the sky, spreading large amounts of radioactive fuel and materials into the atmosphere.

In September 2022, Russian forces fled the Ukrainian town of Balakliia.

But they left their traces everywhere.

One of them is this abandoned building, which the Russians used as a military base during their occupation of Balakliia.

It was here that Reuters discovered thousands of documents revealing the inner workings of the Russian military.

Inside, posters reading ""do not smoke, do not litter,"" ""if we leave, they will come.""

Notebooks and loose papers showing coordinates of Russian intelligence units, records of calls from commanders, details of battles, names of men killed, equipment destroyed.

And accounts of a breakdown in morale and discipline.

In all, Reuters reviewed more than a thousand pages of documents.

They shed new light on events leading up to one of President Vladimir Putin's most stinging battlefield defeats: Russia’s chaotic retreat from Ukraine’s northeast in September.

The camera captures him darting around and putting a black glove on one of his hands before he turns back and jumps over the counter to attack the lone female employee. Shocking video footage shows her trying to run away until her attacker grabs her, puts her in a headlock and drags her to the floor. Two other men (also left) then enter the shop and frantically ransack the shop before trying to escape - only to find they can't open the door. Failing to spot the switch needed to get out, they have to kick it open before fleeing the scene.

Finland and Sweden are both expected to make a formal request to join the Western alliance, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Putin also said there was no threat to Finland's security, with which Russia shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border.

The Russian foreign ministry has indicated there will be retaliation, and the country's decision to suspend electricity supplies to Finland is being seen as an early sign of this.

""Either he does run again ... Bill Clinton was actually at a similar rate and he went on to win re-election ... most people would agree Biden is not Bill Clinton but theoretically it's possible,"" Ms Gada told Sky News host Andrew Bolt.

""The second scenario is he finishes out his term and then steps aside and then other people from the Democrat bench vie for the job.

""And then the third scenario ... is that he doesn't even finish out this term and potentially he steps aside after the midterm elections coming up in November.

A Swiss League match between FC Thun and Zurich was disrupted after a pine marten escaped onto the pitch on Sunday and evaded capture for over five minutes. 

The marten, which is similar to a weasel, appeared at one point to have be caught Zurich defender Loris Benito. 

But Benito was bitten for his troubles and it managed to escape again. 
Martens are known for their sharp teeth which are usually used to eat birds, berries and the occasional garden hose. 

So it was up to Zurich goalkeeper Davide Da Costa, armed with his gloves, to pick up the marten. 

The crowd applauded as Da Costa escorted the pitch invader off the field. 
Zurich went on to win 4-0.

2141,qmGVHgc4Syc,ABC News In-depth,Return of Marcos: How Philippines's Corrupt Dynasty Rebuilt Its Power | Foreign Correspondent,2022-05-05T10:00:17Z,25,"“How does Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the son of a dictator, who was ousted in a people power revolt 36 years earlier, how can history have been changed so drastically? With the help of social media platforms.” 
Maria Ressa, journalist and Noble laureate.

Ferdinand Marcos Jnr, the son of his dictator father Ferdinand Snr, is poised to become the next President of the Philippines.

Once synonymous with corruption and authoritarianism, the Marcos family is restoring its once tarnished reputation.

So how did this miraculous makeover happen?

Reporter Bonny Symons-Brown visits the Philippines on the eve of momentous national elections to find out how Bongbong Marcos became so popular his rivals barely stand a chance.

She finds a nation deeply divided over its recent political history.

Ferdinand Marcos ruled the country for two decades with an iron fist, imposing martial law, even jailing and torturing his political opponents.

The President and his glamourous, powerful wife Imelda Marcos flaunted their lavish lifestyle as they stole billions from the nation’s coffers.

In 1986, they were forced out of the country by a ‘People Power’ revolution but today many Filippinos have forgotten why and forgiven the family.

“I think people get tired of the mudslinging against the Marcoses, and people now realise that the best president and the best administration we had was President Marcos”, says Larry Gadon, a senatorial candidate on Marcos Jr’s ticket.

He dismisses the stories of torture and human rights abuses under martial law as ‘propaganda’.

But Cristina lived it. A member of the underground residuring the martial law years, she was picked up by soldiers, interrogated and tortured.

“We have to continue to tell the story so that it doesn’t happen again”, she says. Journalist and Nobel Laureate Maria Ressa says part of the problem is the massive spread of disinformation online.

“What social media has done is to spread lies faster than facts,” she tells Symons-Brown. “And this will help pave the way for a win.”

This is a timely and unsettling story about how the powerful weapon of social media can be deployed to rewrite history.

Subscribe NOW to The Economist: http://econ.st/1Fsu2Vj

24 & ready to die is the tragic case of Emily, a young Belgian woman granted the right to a doctor’s help to end her own life because of her persistent, severe depression.

Belgium and the Netherlands are the only countries which permit doctor-assisted dying for those experiencing unbearable mental suffering. 

Several American states allow doctor-assisted dying for the terminally ill, including, from next year, California.

Majorities in 13 of the 15 countries polled by The Economist and IPSOS MORI in June support doctor-assisted dying.

The Economist has championed doctor-assisted dying in articles and editorials since the 1990s, including most recently a cover story in June this year. The Economist ran a video advert in London in September and Berlin asking: “Could you live a life like this?” to encourage people to start talking about the right to die.

Support for doctor-assisted dying is growing globally. Bills have recently been debated in Britain and Germany, and a ruling in Canada’s Supreme Court means that country will soon have legal doctor-assisted dying too. California’s governor signed an assisted-dying bill into law in October.

A recent poll by Ipsos-MORI for The Economist found majorities in support of doctor-assisted dying laws in 13 out of 15 countries surveyed—including the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada and Germany. But only in Belgium and the Netherlands were majorities in favour of allowing doctor-assisted dying in cases of unbearable suffering that is mental, rather than physical.

The Economist supports the introduction of legalised doctor-assisted dying around the world. Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor-in-chief of The Economist, says: “For The Economist, the case for allowing doctor-assisted dying relies on personal choice and individual autonomy. Our liberal values and respect for human dignity mean that for this paper, doctor-assisted dying is a cause worth championing.”

Right-wing lawyer Sidney Powell 'is cooperating' with federal criminal probe into fundraising
By Katelyn Polantz, CNN Reporter, Crime and Justice

A lawyer for Sidney Powell, a well-known, Trump-connected attorney, acknowledged that her organization's fundraising connected to the 2020 election is subject to an ongoing federal criminal investigation.

Powell's lawyer, Howard Kleinhendler, told CNN that his client ""is cooperating"" with the investigation into her organization, Defending the Republic, by the US Attorney's Office in the District of Columbia. That cooperation includes ""rolling productions"" of documents.

The Washington Post first reported details of the probe, including a grand jury subpoena for records related to it, in November.

Powell has not been charged with a crime. The investigation has continued this year, though two sources with knowledge of the probe tell CNN it's unclear when -- if ever -- any charges would be filed.

A spokesman for the DC US Attorney's Office declined to comment on Friday.
Powell's response to the federal investigators and to a major defamation lawsuit from the company Dominion Voting Systems comes into play as she now prepares to respond to the House select committee investigating January 6, which subpoenaed her this week.

A report from the British Defense Ministry on Friday said Ukrainian troops were also likely to continue pushing back Russian forces on the northwestern axis from Kyiv toward the Hostomel Airfield, some 26 kilometers from the capital. It was captured by Russian forces on February 25 at the start of Moscow's invasion. Russian forces in the south of Ukraine were still seeking to circumvent the city of Mykolaiv as they try to move in on Odesa, with fierce Ukrainian resistance and supply issues impeding their progress, according to the report.

A number of Russian military units have withdrawn behind the Russian border after suffering the loss of more than half their personnel, the Ukrainian general staff has said. According to Oleksiy Arestovych, a senior adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy, the front lines between Ukrainian and Russian troops have become ""practically frozen."" The general staff said Russian troops were continuing to blockade the large cities of Kharkiv and Sumy and also seemed to be preparing for a new offensive in Izyum in the Kharkiv region. The information cannot be independently verified.

The number of people in Germany who are in favor of Ukraine joining the EU has risen by 16% since 2018, a YouGov survey has shown. Forty-six percent of those asked would now like to see Ukraine in the bloc. The survey also showed a clear reduction in the number of people opposed to the country's EU membership, with just 30% against compared with 47% in 2018. Other countries are showing similar trends, with 42% of people in France in favor of Ukraine's EU accession (2018: 22%), 60% in Spain and 45% in Italy. The percentage of those who are undecided remains fairly high in all the countries included in the survey at 24-29%. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged that his country be quickly accepted into the bloc amid Russia's invasion and has signed a formal application. But several EU countries, including Germany, have spoken out against fast-tracking Ukraine's bid for membership.

1642,i8kkeztq70c,Daily Mail,Putin speech to oligarchs: Russian leader says Ukraine invasion was 'desperate measure',2022-02-24T22:36:07Z,25,"Russian forces have seized control of the Chernobyl power plant, 60 miles north of Kiev, after a 'fierce' battle with the condition of nuclear storage facilities 'unknown', officials in Kiev have said. Video revealed Russian tanks and armoured vehicles in front of the destroyed reactor, amid fears radiation could leak and shower Europe with fallout. It came as Turkey reported that one of its ships had been hit by a 'bomb' off the coast of Odessa, where fighting is also going on. Turkey is a member of NATO, underlining fears that the war in Ukraine could quickly suck in other states and spark an all-out conflict in Europe. Elsewhere, Kiev ordered civilians into bomb shelters and declared a curfew amid fears Russia is about to strike the Ukrainian capital as Kiev's troops lost control of a key airfield around 15 miles away. The Ukrainian army was this afternoon fighting in almost every region of the country, battling the Russians for control of military bases, airports, cities and ports from Kharkiv to Kiev, and Donetsk to Odessa after Vladimir Putin declared all-out war.

KAYLEIGH MCENANY: That's an extraordinary development that happened at the last hour of your show. I mean, when you have law enforcement saying, essentially, this is government overreach, I'm resigning in protest, they're exactly right. This Emergencies Act is only supposed to be invoked if there is a threat to the sovereignty of the Canadian government. So you're telling me these peaceful truckers who are opposing government overreach surrounded by kids and very family-oriented affairs, that's a threat to the sovereignty of the government of Canada? I don't think so, justin Trudeau. I don't think so. But what's amazing they're protesting government overreach. So elitist, Justin Trudeau, says what's the answer? More government overreach.

581,LuGNSedmLCc,Sky News,Ukraine Invasion: Russian people start to feel the pinch of economic sanctions,2022-03-02T23:19:55Z,25,"The economic consequences of the invasion are being felt hardest in Russia itself. 

Sanctions have thrown the economy into turmoil, and many international brands like Apple are now refusing to sell their products inside the country.

For many Russians, their way of life is changing, leaving them to question whether they want to remain in a pariah state.

The limb, complete with skin, is just one of a series of remarkable finds emerging from the Tanis fossil site in the US State of North Dakota.

But it's not just their exquisite condition that's turning heads - it's what these ancient specimens purport to represent.

The claim is the Tanis creatures were killed on the actual day the asteroid struck Earth 66 million years ago, which saw the reign of dinosaurs end.

The BBC's Rebecca Morrelle reports.

Russia says more than 1,000 Ukrainian marines have surrendered in the besieged city, although the authorities there have denied this.   

However Mariupol’s defenders have said that many of their soldiers are dead and the remaining troops are very short of ammunition. 

The city has been surrounded for weeks by Russian forces and Ukraine’s government says it believes tens of thousands of civilians have died there.

Ex-Theranos employees describe culture of secrecy at Elizabeth Holmes' startup: ‘The Dropout’ podcast ep. 1

Not so long ago, Elizabeth Holmes was Silicon Valley’s rising star. Like so many of the most successful entrepreneurs before her, she dropped out of college to start a company. But unlike many others, her startup would go on to be valued at almost $10 billion making her the world’s youngest self-made female billionaire.

The company was called Theranos, a combination of the words “therapy” and “diagnosis.” It was praised for being revolutionary and for creating a breakthrough that would change the medical industry forever.

Her board of directors was a who’s who of government heavyweights that at a time included former Secretaries of State George Shultz and Henry Kissinger, former Secretaries of Defense Gen. James Mattis and William Perry and former U.S. Senators Bill Frist and Sam Nunn.

Investments came from some of the wealthiest and most connected people in the world, like media mogul Rupert Murdoch, the Walton family, the DeVos family and even the Kraft family behind the New England Patriots.

But it all came crashing down. Today, Holmes is facing up to 20 years in prison and awaiting a criminal trial for charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, to which she has pleaded not guilty.

775,FJHpWx8PKMk,DW News,Ukraine Invasion: NATO activates chemical and nuclear defense elements | Ukraine latest,2022-03-24T18:00:04Z,25,"NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the Western military alliance was concerned Russia may be preparing a pretext to use chemical weapons. ""We see the rhetoric and we see that Russia is trying to create some kind of pretext accusing Ukraine, the United States and NATO allies of preparing to use chemical and biological weapons,"" he told reporters after a NATO summit in Brussels. ""Our top military commander ... has activated NATO's chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defense elements and allies are deploying additional chemical and biological and nuclear defenses,"" he said. He reiterated the significant impact any use of chemical weapons would have on the course of events, not just in Ukraine, but also in neighboring countries. He also stressed the continuity of NATO's Open Door policy, which has been one of Moscow's main complaints and justifications for its invasion of Ukraine. Asked whether NATO would provide Ukraine with the list of weapons and equipment requested by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Stoltenberg said that alliance members are already supplying weapons and equipment, but ""at the same time, we have a responsibility to prevent this conflict from becoming a full-fledged war in Europe.""

Stoltenberg said that the alliance will increase its support for Ukraine as well as its deployments in Eastern Europe during a press conference that came after an emergency session of NATO member-state leaders. Stoltenberg's comments coincided with the release of a statement from the alliance as well as the announcement that he will stay on for an extra year due to the invasion, delaying his plan to step down from the position.
NATO members are ""equipping Ukraine with significant military supplies including anti-tank and air defense systems and drones, which are proving highly effective, as well as substantial financial and humanitarian aid,"" Stoltenberg said. ""Today we agreed to do more, including cyber security assistance and equipment to help Ukraine protect against biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear threats,"" he added. The NATO chief warned against escalating the war and pledged more support for other countries facing threats from Russia, namely Georgia and Bosnia.

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry released a statement on Thursday claiming that Russian forces have ""forcibly deported about 6,000 Mariupol residents to Russian filtration camps."" It said that Russia is also trying to do the same to the 15,000 residents in the Left Bank region of the city. ""The Russian occupiers are forcing them to move to Russia. The invaders confiscate people's passports and other identity documents,"" the statement said, adding that it was ""in order to use them as hostages and put more political pressure on Ukraine."" The statement also accused Russian forces of firing on columns of civilians fleeing from the city that was the subject of intense bombardment by the Russian military and a siege that left thousands of people without access to food, water and power for days.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on NATO to provide ""unrestricted"" military aid while speaking to representatives of the alliance over video-link. ""To save people and our cities, Ukraine needs military assistance without restrictions. In the same way that Russia is using its full arsenal without restrictions against us,"" he said. He thanked the members of the alliance for the support they have already provided, but said it was not enough. ""You can give us one percent of all your planes. One percent of your tanks. One percent!"" During the call, Zelenskyy also accused Russia of using phosphorus weapons — which ignite in contact with air and can burn for a long time as well as causing severe burns on people it comes into contact with. ""This morning, by the way, phosphorus bombs were used. Russian phosphorus bombs. Adults were killed again and children were killed again,"" Zelensky said. ""The Alliance can once more prevent the death of Ukrainians from Russian strikes, from Russian occupation, by giving us all the weapons we need.""

Heart-warming footage showed the girl, identified as Gabriela from Colombia, crying as she bolted form the crowd towards the Pope's convoy. Despite being hauled back by security at the event, the Pope quickly gestured for the driver of his Popemobile to stop so he could speak to the girl. One of the guards then held her up so the pontiff could give her a blessing.

The defence ministry said ammunition on the Moskva exploded in an unexplained fire and that the ship tipped over while being towed back to port.

Ukraine claims it struck the vessel with its Neptune missiles.

The 510-crew warship had led Russia's naval assault on Ukraine, which made it an important symbolic and military target.

The attacks began on Thursday after Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a televised address that he had approved a “special military operation”. The move came after Moscow earlier recognised rebel-held territories in Luhansk and Donetsk and said they had asked for its “help”.
Russian missiles rained down on Ukrainian cities. Ukraine reported columns of troops pouring across its borders into the eastern Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Luhansk regions, and landing by sea at the cities of Odesa and Mariupol in the south.
Russian troops attacked Ukraine from Belarus, as well as from Russia with Belarusian support. An attack was also being launched from the annexed Crimean Peninsula, Ukraine’s border guard service said.

1028,tcOY8ziJdLk,The Telegraph,What sound does an ancient Egyptian mummy make? Scientist recreate voice of 3000 year old mummy,2020-01-23T16:00:10Z,25,"When Egyptian priest Nesyamun died more than 3,000 years ago his departing wish was that he be allowed to speak in the afterlife so he could address his gods, and be granted entry into eternity.

Now, with the help of science, the holy man has indeed found his voice after death.

Academics at Royal Holloway, University of London, University of York and Leeds Museum scanned the mummy of Nesyamum, 3D printed his vocal tract then played soundwaves through it to create an impression of how the priest might have sounded.

So far, the only noise they’ve created is a nondescript bleat, sounding something like ‘beh’ but the researchers are hoping to use computer modelling to recreate words and even sentences. 

The experts said it allowed people to ‘make direct contact with ancient Egypt by listening to a sound from a vocal tract that has not been heard for over 3000 years.’

And they want to eventually try the technique on other famous ‘heads’, and bring back the voices of notable figures.

2143,rJnOlaZwMeg,ABC News In-depth,Inside Israel's Closed Off Ultra-Orthodox Communities | Foreign Correspondent,2022-04-14T10:00:22Z,25,"In the modern State of Israel, the ultra-Orthodox – or Haredi – communities live a world apart.

Rejecting the secular, they live according to ancient religious principles.
Many Haredi men spend their days in religious schools studying the Jewish bible.

“People here focus on the essentials: on the Torah. Material things are irrelevant here,” says Yossef, a member of a Haredi community on the edge of Tel Aviv.
 
“On Shabbat, cars stand still, everyone observes Shabbat. The women show restraint outdoors.”

Yossef’s wife, Esther, supports her husband.

“Man was created to study day and night. As a woman, I support that and benefit from it as well.”

The Israeli government subsidises this lifestyle, exempting community members from compulsory military service.

It’s lead to resentment among secular Jews, tensions which have deepened during COVID.

“This is a state within a state,” says one Israeli MP. “Many Haredi movements want to integrate into Israeli society…the only problem is that some Haredi leaders strongly hinder this integration.”

Presented by Eric Campbell, this Arte documentary explores how pressures from outside are forcing many Haredim to integrate more with the modern world.

Moshe is one who’s pushing the boundaries. He’s set up a tech company which adheres to religious rules, including providing separate workspaces for men and women.

“In the business world, the sexes share a space and many Haredim don't deal well with that. So, we founded this place, so the Haredim feel comfortable in the high-tech world.”

Chira dreams of becoming a professional singer, but as a Haredi woman she’s not allowed to perform for men. She’s decided she wants to be a performer, but only for other women.

“I will never be able to sing on a stage where everyone can see me. But a new female audience is emerging. They organise parties, celebrations for young girls, festivals for women.”

Moshe feels his community’s traditions can help drive innovation.

“Some think if you preserve tradition, you stay stuck in the past, but the future is innovation… The talent for innovation comes precisely from reflection…This legacy enables us to look forward and invent new things.”

This is a fascinating and rare insight into a normally-closed world on the cusp of change.

DW's Alexandra von Nahmen explains what's behind the US decision.

777,3aWHb8Mg1xg,DW News,Kyiv region: Are Russian troops retreating or preparing for another attack? | Ukraine latest,2022-04-03T15:45:01Z,25,"- Warning! This report contains images some may find disturbing. - 

Ukrainian forces say Russian troops have either withdrawn or been repelled from the entire region around Kyiv. But soldiers moving into villages and towns around the capital find scores of dead civilians. 

The defence ministry says its forces have retaken more than 30 towns and villages. For weeks, battles north of the capital region kept Russian forces from advancing. But now, some of the true cost of that resistance is becoming clear, as Ukrainian soldiers and members of the Red Cross enter these locations.

The debate follows transgender weightlifter Laurel Hubbard attempting to qualify for Tokyo as rules say if her testosterone is below certain levels for 12 months then she can compete.

971,l-u7Qln1q6s,The Sun,British-led Dark Angels team blast Russian positions with a Javelin anti-tank missiles,2022-06-24T23:00:12Z,25,"A BRIT-led team of international volunteers blasted a Russian position with a Javelin anti-tank missile on Ukraine’s front line.

The daredevil squad, led by ex-Para Daniel Burke, crept into no-man’s land in occupied Kherson province to launch the rocket attack.

Their unit, known as the Dark Angels, began the commando-style raid after troops from Ukraine’s 28th Brigade gave them an £80,000 fire-and-forget missile.

Body cam footage shot by fellow Brit fighter Sam Newey — a ­student from Birmingham with no previous military experience — shows the four-man team creeping up to a ridge line to fire the US-made guided weapon.

Britain has given Ukraine some 200 Javelin missiles which have a maximum range of 2.5km. The US donated thousands more.

The Sun met the volunteers at their bunker HQ in a bomb-blitzed frontline village.

The highest ranking volunteer was a former US Marine sergeant, Chris.

Others include a German-born bartender, British ex-con Mark Ayres, 49, and a US gun enthusiast, Justin, 29, who fought in Afghanistan.

Burke formed the Dark Angels to deliver humanitarian aid and provide medical and military training.

His volunteers are all unpaid — and laugh off Russian claims they are far-right foreign mercenaries.

(Subscribe: https://bit.ly/C4_News_Subscribe)

Russian forces have continued their operation all over the country.

There was more heavy shelling of Chernihiv and an American journalist was shot dead near Irpin. 

The attack on the Yavoriv base near the Polish border is the furthest west the Russians have attacked since the invasion started.  

Ukrainians have also been protesting against the Russian occupation in Kherson. 

But there have been hopeful messages from both sides over negotiations, although it is too early to tell whether that will lead to anything.

The Israel Defence Force (IDF) said air and ground forces launched a series of attacks last night - dropping 450 missiles on the Gaza Strip in just 40 minutes.

As the conflict escalated, some 160 aircraft were flying simultaneously to conduct a massive attack on the terrorist group in Gaza last night.

This 40-minute airstrike was the largest Israeli strike since the outbreak of fighting earlier this week, the military says.

And 9,000 Israeli reserve troops have been called up amid the escalating violence in the region.

Palestinians militants have fired some 1,800 rockets and the military has launched more than 600 airstrikes, toppling at least three apartment blocks.

And on Thursday night, an additional 220 projectiles were fired on Israel from Gaza.

The IDF had previously said soldiers on the ground had entered the Palestinian enclave - as its fighter jets continued to hit targets belonging to militants.

The force tweeted: ""IDF air and ground troops are currently attacking in the Gaza Strip.""

The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack will hold its eighth public hearing July 21. The hearing is expected to focus on what then-President Donald Trump was doing during the three plus hours that his supporters were attacking the U.S. Capitol in an effort to stop the certification Joe Biden’s presidential victory on Jan. 6, 2021.

The hearing is scheduled to begin at 8 p.m. ET. To preview the hearing, beginning at 7 p.m. ET, the PBS NewsHour will take a look back at the last seven public hearings and Digital Anchor Nicole Ellis will host a conversation looking ahead at what can be expected to come out of the July 21 primetime hearing.

The hearing comes after the committee on July 12 focused on the role of far-right extremist groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers ahead of the attack and the role that Trump and his allies played in stoking baseless theories of election fraud ahead of the insurrection.

778,1pgmvIB3Fjw,DW News,3 Months into Russia's war against Ukraine: What to expect for the upcoming battles? | DW News,2022-05-24T08:12:43Z,25,"Russia's invasion of Ukraine has surprised many military analysts - who expected fighting to be over very quickly. Instead, the three-month-old war has exposed unexpected weaknesses in Russia's forces. Heavy troop losses are reporttedly hurting morale even more, and the war's initial aims have been severely scaled back. So  just how - and why - has Russia's army performed so badly?

UK officials see Russia closing in on Luhansk
""Russia has increased the intensity of its operations in the Donbas as it seeks to encircle Severodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne,"" the UK Ministry of Defense tweeted in In its latest intelligence update. At the same time, UK officials noted ""strong Ukrainian resistance with forces occupying well dug-in defensive positions."" ""Russia’s capture of the Severodonetsk pocket would see the whole of Luhansk Oblast placed under Russian occupation,"" they said. At the same time moving the frontline further west ""will extend Russian lines of communication and likely see its forces face further logistic resupply difficulties,"" according to the British ministry. Ex-Russian diplomat describes atmosphere in Russian Foreign Ministry Boris Bondarev, who until Monday was listed as the Counsellor to the UN at Russia's mission in Geneva, warned that his Russian colleagues were growing nonchalant when considering nuclear weapons' use. ""They think that if you hit some village in America with a nuclear strike, then the Americans will immediately get scared and run to beg for mercy on their knees,"" Bondarev told the The New York Times. ""That’s how many of our people think, and I fear that this is the line that they are passing along to Moscow,"" he added. Bondarev's job in Switzerland was focused mainly on arms control and disarmament issues.

Zaporizhzhia region to use the ruble, says Russian-backed Melitopol leader
The Russian-backed head of the military-civilian administration of occupied Melitopol, Galina Danilchenko, said that rubles will be the accepted in the Zaporizhzhia region, according to an interview cited by Russian state-run RIA news agency. Danilchenko noted that residents would be expected to exchange Ukrainian hryvnias for Russian currency. ""You can pay with rubles for all the services of enterprises, purchase raw materials for the production of your own products, ship products to the buyer and receive ruble proceeds to your current account,"" she said.

Harris and Pence traded accusations over the federal response to the pandemic that has claimed the lives of more than 210,000 Americans, with Harris harshly criticizing the administration's record. President Trump tested positive for the coronavirus just six days ago.

""The American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country,"" Harris said, with Pence sitting 12 feet away from her, separated by two panes of plexiglass as protection against the virus.

Pence, who again tested negative for the coronavirus earlier in the day, defended the administration's response and said the president's moves in the early days of the pandemic saved lives.

USA Today's Susan Page moderated the vice presidential debate. The next debate between Mr. Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden is scheduled for Thursday, Oct. 15 in Miami and will be moderated by C-SPAN's Steve Scully.

Eight missiles are believed to have been fired at Ukraine's Center for International Peacekeeping and Security, according to Lviv's Regional Military Administration on Telegram. The center is located in Yavoriv, not far from the Polish border and some 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Lviv. Lviv regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy said on Telegram that 35 people have died in the strike and a further 134 were injured. The strike on the military base could possibly be a Russian message intended for NATO. The US and other NATO countries previously conducted training exercises with the Ukrainian military at the center called Rapid Trident 21, according to the US Army website. A Ukrainian general cited by the US army website said the Rapid Trident 21 exercises held at the Yavoriv center were ""not just another stage of military skills improvement, but also an important step towards Ukraine's European integration."" Ukraine's defense minister said in a tweet that ""foreign instructors"" work at the training center. A NATO official told Reuters news agency that there were no alliance personnel at the base. The mayor of Ivano-Frankivsk, Ruslan Martsinkiv, said on Facebook that the western Ukrainian city's airport was also targeted in an attack early Sunday. 

A Russian airstrike in the southern city of Mykolaiv near Odesa left nine people dead, according to regional governor Vitaliy Kim. Mykolaiv serves as an important transportation hub within Ukraine.

The mayor of Dniprodrudne, Yevheniy Matvieyev, was kidnapped by Russian forces, according to Ukrainian officials such as Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. Dniprorudne has around 20,000 inhabitants. Earlier, Russian troops kidnapped Melitopol Ivan Federov on Friday, Ukraine's parliament said.  

The UK's Defense Ministry (MOD) said Russian forces are attempting to ""envelop"" Ukrainian troops in the eastern parts of the country ""as they advance from Kharkiv in the north and Mariupol in the south.""

Marjorie Taylor Greene compares House mask mandates to the Holocaust
By Ryan Nobles, CNN

(CNN) Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, during an interview on a conservative podcast this week, compared House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to continue to require members of the House to wear masks on the chamber floor to steps the Nazis took to control the Jewish population during the Holocaust.

Greene, in a conversation with the Christian Broadcasting Network's David Brody Real America's Voice TV show ""The Water Cooler,"" attacked Pelosi and accused her of being a hypocrite for asking GOP members to prove they have all been vaccinated before allowing members to be in the House chamber without a mask.

""You know, we can look back at a time in history where people were told to wear a gold star, and they were definitely treated like second class citizens, so much so that they were put in trains and taken to gas chambers in Nazi Germany,"" Greene said. ""And this is exactly the type of abuse that Nancy Pelosi is talking about.""

Jewish groups were quick to condemn Greene's remarks. 

""You can never compare health-related restrictions with yellow stars gas chambers and other Nazi atrocities. Such comparisons demean the Holocaust and contaminate American political speech,"" the American Jewish Congress said in a tweet in response to Greene's comments. ""Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene must immediately retract and apologize.""

780,qmt94B5eQwg,DW News,Russian forces close in on Ukraine major cities | DW News,2022-02-25T08:11:57Z,25,"Ukrainian forces battled Russian troops on multiple fronts, including the outskirts of Kyiv.

Ukraine's border guard has said that males aged 18-60 are not allowed to leave the country in a statement posted on its Facebook account. The border guard said that this restriction will last for the duration of the period of martial law in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared martial law earlier on Thursday shortly after it was reported that Russia had attacked Ukraine.

Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar has warned that Russian forces are poised to enter areas just outside the capital, Kyiv, on Friday. A government adviser, Anton Herashchenko, said the Russian troops planned to break through into the capital using tanks but that Ukrainian forces were ready to counter the attack with anti-tank missiles supplied by foreign allies.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had earlier said the government had information that ""subversive groups"" were moving on the city. This comes after a night of reported air raids in the city that were said by a DW correspondent to have set some residential buildings on fire. Many Kyiv residents have taken shelter in underground metro stations.

The Ukrainian general staff of the armed forces said Ukrainian troops were firmly resisting what he called ""Russian occupiers"" in the Kyiv area. Ukrainian airborne assault troops were reported in a statement to have stopped ""overwhelming enemy forces"" at the Teteriv River near the settlements of Dymer and Ivankiv, northwest of the capital. The statement said a bridge over the river was destroyed. ""The hardest day will be today. The enemy's plan is to break through with tank columns from the side of Ivankiv and Chernihiv to Kyiv,'' Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said on Telegram.

Serena Williams announces she will 'evolve away from tennis' after upcoming US Open
By Ben Morse

Serena Williams has announced that she will ""evolve away from tennis"" after this year's US Open to focus on ""other things that are important to me.""

In an article in Vogue, the 23-time grand slam winner said that, although she will try to win at the US Open, it is time for her to move ""in a different direction.""
""There comes a time in life when we have to decide to move in a different direction,"" Williams posted on Instagram with a picture of herself on the cover of Vogue with the title: 'Serena's Farewell...I'm terrible at goodbyes.'

""That time is always hard when you love something so much. My goodness do I enjoy tennis. But now, the countdown has begun. I have to focus on being a mom, my spiritual goals and finally discovering a different, but just exciting Serena. I'm gonna relish these next few weeks.""

The announcement comes a day after the 40-year-old won her first singles match in 430 days.

She played her first singles match in over a year at Wimbledon in June, losing to France's Harmony Tan. Afterwards, she hinted that she could play on home soil at the US Open, which begins August 29.

Novak Djokovic targets Pete Sampras' year-end world No. 1 record in Vienna
By George Ramsay

While unable to edge closer to Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal in the grand slam leaderboard in the second half of the tennis season, Novak Djokovic is chasing one record that could see him outstrip his rivals.

Djokovic needs to win just two matches at this week's Vienna Open to end the year as world No. 1 for the sixth time, equaling Pete Sampras' record set between 1993 and 1998.

The Serb is currently tied with Federer, Nadal -- whom he lost to in the final of the French Open earlier this month -- and Jimmy Connors on five year-ending No. 1 accolades, securing them in 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015 and 2018.

2144,qInkR8P7q3M,ABC News In-depth,Inside SpaceX's Mission to Send Humans into Deep Space | Foreign Correspondent,2021-09-30T10:00:11Z,25,"In the era of New Space, billionaire Elon Musk is blazing the trail. He’s building a gigantic starship to fly humans further than ever before. 

In the tiny Texan hamlet of Boca Chica, a huge rocket is being built and tested. It’s Elon Musk’s Starship, a 120-metre-high spacecraft whose mission is to transport humans to the moon and beyond, to Mars.

Musk and his company SpaceX are at the forefront of what’s being called ‘New Space’, the rush to commercialise the space sector.

His ambition is extraordinary; he wants to colonise the Red Planet. 

“It’s helpful to have the objective of a self-sustaining city on Mars. This has to be the objective”, says Musk.

In his quest to perfect the Starship, Musk has been blowing up prototypes. 

“He doesn't really care if it's messy, he doesn’t really care if it appears to be chaotic, he's trying to go forward into the future as fast as possible”, says space writer Eric Berger. 

But the mighty rocket has its critics, including a former head of NASA, Charlie Bolden.

“The difficulty for me as a huge fan of SpaceX, but a huge sceptic about Starship is the fact that it's so big, it's so massive”, says Bolden. “If Neil Armstrong were alive today to talk to them, he would probably say, ""That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.” 

US correspondent Sarah Ferguson heads to Texas to see Musk’s space base up close. She joins a band of devotees in Boca Chica, from Gene the local surfer to MaryLiz and Ryan who are dedicating their lives to documenting the billionaire’s space odyssey.

She speaks to members of the ‘space establishment’ – former and current NASA executives who’ve decided to accept and work with the great disruptor. NASA recently awarded Musk a multi-billion-dollar contract to build its next moon lander.

“I think actually this will be a perfect example of ‘New Space’ and ‘Old Space’ meeting together in a great new mission”, says Kathy Lueders, head of the NASA mission to send humans back to the moon. 

Sarah travels to Florida’s space coast to witness the launch of SpaceX’s Inspiration4, the first time civilians have flown into orbit.

Musk is a polarising figure, but he’s changed forever how humans view space.

976,Nehco1hfYk0,The Sun,Brit lads dodge Russian drones & shelling 0.5km from front line to bring aid to Ukrainians,2022-06-18T08:00:11Z,25,"Vans Without Borders have returned to Ukraine to continue their vital and groundbreaking work to deliver humanitarian aid to vulnerable Ukrainians who have been left isolated as a consequence of Russian aggression.

Exclusive by Valerie Browne

Donate to Vans Without Borders here: https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/p/vans-without-borders-ukraine-vital-aid-fundraiser


During their last mission, they pioneered routes across Ukraine and were some of the first humanitarian volunteers to deliver international aid in Bucha, Irpin and Chernihiv, after they were devastated.

Their team has now grown to four vans and we will be looking to bring tonnes of aid across Ukraine, but need your help to achieve this.

Every penny you donate will be spent directly on helping the Ukrainian people, as all of our team members are volunteers - unlike international organisations who take up to 15% of donations for salaries.

To fill one van with canned food and essential supplies - sourced from a local Ukrainian business - it costs around £1,500.

A large part of our mission is also delivering targeted aid to vulnerable refugees such as those with disabilities, children and the elderly.

Tracing their journeys from quiet Australian suburbia to the streets of the Middle East and now the al-Hawl camp, the program exposes the network that led them to Islamic State and reveal the key figure at the centre of it.

Their families in Australia are also speaking out for the first time, in the knowledge that going public will bring judgement and attention.

They too, want answers as to how the women came to be living under Islamic State.

In the face of new security laws passed in Australia that could see them prevented from returning anytime soon, the women insist they are not a threat. They are begging the Australian government to let them come home.

781,f-KQftYx7sc,DW News,Russia attacks Ukraine: Latest developments | DW News,2022-02-24T13:40:34Z,25,"Russia launched a wide-ranging attack on Ukraine on Thursday, with explosions heard across the country and Russian tanks entering Ukrainian territories. Here's a look at the most significant developments from today and how the situation unfolded: 

In an unscheduled television address on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that he ""decided to conduct a special military operation."" Putin claimed the ""operation"" was to ""protect people who have been subjected to bullying and genocide ... for the last eight years,"" or since 2014, when Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea. Moscow-backed separatists have fought the government's forces in eastern Ukraine ever since. 

The Russian government claimed hours earlier that separatist leaders had requested military help to fend off what they called Ukrainian ""aggression."" Putin said, ""We will strive for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine."" At an emergency UN Security Council meeting, Russia's envoy Vassily Nebenzia said the ""operation"" was targeting ""the junta"" in power in Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was elected to office in an election in 2019.

Air raid sirens sounded over the Ukrainian capital at the break of dawn.  The Ukrainian leadership said at least 40 soldiers had been killed so far by Russian airstrikes. Zelenskyy declared martial law and said Russia was attacking his country's ""military infrastructure."" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said, ""Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes."" ""This is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now,"" he added. Ukraine's border guard reported that Russian tanks entered Ukraine in the Luhansk region and Crimea. Russia's Defense Ministry said it had neutralized Ukrainian military airbases and air defense systems.

These people are fuelling a cocaine boom across the country. Australians are the highest per capita users of cocaine in the world, and pay some of the highest prices in the world for it – about $350 a gram.

1186,ErwIlvQ_RVk,The Economist,America v China: why the trade war won't end soon,2019-11-14T17:15:07Z,25,"America and China are edging closer to signing a deal in the trade war. But that won’t mark the end—the issues at the heart of the conflict will be very difficult to resolve. Read more here: https://econ.st/2qQItl6

The world’s leading superpowers are locking horns. Over the past 16 months America and China have been trading blows through tariffs on goods. The impact is being felt on industries worldwide. But what is the story behind the America-China trade war?

So the trade war, what have you guys been looking at? The US doesn’t like that China is growing so fast and set to overtake America as the biggest economy in the world if it hasn’t already by certain measures. Basically China and the US are caught in this race of imposing tariffs on each other so the US slaps a high tariff on certain products then China retaliates.

It’s multiple industries across multiple markets, it’s huge. And I think right now would be a really good time to look at what’s happened how it could impact the world from now on. 

At The Economist, we’ve been covering the trade war extensively Soumaya Keynes is our trade and globalisation editor based in Washington, DC.

How did this whole trade war kick off? How did this whole trade war start? For a long time there have been frustrations that past American administrations had with the Chinese. On the 2016 presidential campaign trail you started to see some really tough rhetoric.

China’s economic rise has been dramatic. In 1978 China’s GDP at market prices was just 6% of America’s. Last year it had grown to 66%. When considering local spending power China has already overtaken America. This unprecedented growth began with President Deng Xiaoping. He started opening up China’s economy to the world in 1978 and the country quickly became “the world’s factory”. Over the next decade, exports as a share of GDP tripled and by 1988 15% of China’s exports went to America. The World Trade Organisation opened its doors to China in 2001. And it was America that ushered it in. 

After joining the WTO, China became an economic superpower. But people had expected the country to also become more like a Western capitalist economy. That didn’t happen. America now claims that China achieved its growth by not playing fair. Are those claims justified?

The Trump administration has been using tariffs or taxes on imported goods to try to force the Chinese to change their ways. In July 2018 America imposed tariffs of 25% on $34bn worth of Chinese products. That almost doubled the average tariff rate on Chinese imports from 3.8% to 6.7%. And it’s American firms that have to pay that tax. But with every increase from America, came an increase from China. Since the start of the trade war China has more than doubled its average tariff rate. America’s has tripled. The fight has become overtly political because China’s tariffs are hitting President Trump’s voter base. Many counties where Trump won in the 2016 election were here in the Great Plains and these are the counties most affected by China’s tariffs. 

As things stand now, a ceasefire in the trade war could be drawing near. The two leaders are hoping to agree on a “phase one” deal soon which could mean some tariffs being lifted The Trump administration wants China to buy more American produce and tighten up their intellectual property rules. If that phase one deal is signed will it be the beginning of the end of the trade war?

Even if there is a phase one deal there will be a lot of issues still to be resolved. But there’s more to the trade war than just tariffs. America has also imposed restrictions on some Chinese firms especially ones in the tech industry.

A follow-on round will take place in the coming days. Both delegations will return to their respective capitals for further consultations. 

Meanwhile the United Nations’ General Assembly met Monday for the first emergency session in decades. Nebenzya, Russia's ambassador to the UN, told the General Assembly that ""for us, Ukraine joining NATO is a red line."" Nebenzya laid the blame for the Russian invasion on Ukraine, saying that Kyiv had failed to stick to the Minsk agreement as well as claiming that Ukrainian forces carried out provocations against people in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014. Nebenzya also accused Ukraine's western partners, especially the US, of ""inciting Kyiv, egging it on, repeating the senseless mantra that their obligations to the Minsk agreements are not being complied with by the Russian Federation.""

Sergiy Kyslytsya, Ukraine's ambassador to the UN, warned the members of UN General Assembly of the consequences of Russia's invasion.
""Russia uses all its military potential to attack Ukraine and has begun redeploying reserve units on the border,"" he said. He also accused the Russian force of attacking civilian infrastructure as well as kindergartens and hospitals, which he called war crimes.

1648,XUc34dmtOk0,Daily Mail,Sweet moment Prince William comforts tired Princess Charlotte at the Platinum Jubilee,2022-06-11T12:15:02Z,26,"Sweet moment Prince William comforts tired Princess Charlotte at the Platinum Jubilee. Prince William and Kate Middleton were joined by their young children Prince George, eight, Princess Charlotte, seven, and Prince Louis, four, at a number of events celebrating the Queen's Jubilee last weekend. However there was one moment when seven-year-old Princess Charlotte, who has become a favourite of royal fans thanks to her sassy personality, was visibly tired and the Duke of Cambridge had to step in to cheer her up at the event outside Buckingham Palace. In the clip shared by royal watchers on Twitter, Charlotte was seen with her head down wiping her eyes. Her loving father William then stroked her hair as he bent down to speak to her. She appeared to nod her head afterwards, then wiping her nose with her arm.

2148,pAFdLaW02jw,ABC News In-depth,The Fight To Take Back Hawaii | Foreign Correspondent,2022-05-12T06:12:38Z,25,"For over a century, the destiny of this island paradise has been in the hands of outsiders. Now native Hawaiians are reclaiming their culture, language and land.
Subscribe: https://ab.co/3yqPOZ5
“Hawaii is being sold to the global elite. It's not give and take. It’s just take, take, take, take.”  Filmmaker Chris Kahunahana

“They took it away in three generations. We’re going to get it back in one. Whatever it takes.” Waterman Pomai Hoapili.

It’s a slice of paradise for some but behind the postcard façade, native Hawaiians have a different story to tell. 

Theirs is a stuggle for land, language and culture, forcibly taken from them by the United States of America.   

Housing prices in Hawaii were already sky high, but in the midst of the pandemic they exploded as mainland Americans bought up island boltholes. The housing crisis is hitting native Hawaiians hardest, forcing many out of their own homes. The state of Hawaii now has the third highest homeless rate in the USA.

This is one of many problems facing native locals who are fighting to ʻKeep Hawaii Hawaiian’.

Reporter Matt Davis visits the Hawaiian Islands to hear from the people fighting to keep their culture alive. In a visually stunning journey, Davis explores the lives of people on the frontline of this modern-day native Hawaiian rennaisance.

“Resistance is not only how we get our land back,” says school principal Kalehua Krug. “But it is also medicine – that resistance is how we heal.”

At his school on the island of Oahu, the curriculum focuses on redsicovering the modern story of Hawaii after the kingdom was overthrown in 1893. The students study the Hawaiian language, hula dancing and other cultural practices alongside the mainstream curriculum.

Davis takes a tour around the back streets of Waikiki with celebrated filmmaker Chris Kahunahana, the first native Hawaiian to direct a feature film. 

“Hawaii was seen as Hollywood’s back drop. It served as a beautiful location for a Caucasian centred hero,” he tells Davis.

His movie Waikiki shows the darker side of these tropical islands – the reality for many native Hawaiians.

Davis visits the powerhouse community leader Twinkle Borge who has set up a permanent camp to provide shelter for Hawaiians who are sleeping rough. She reveals an extraordinary plan to reclaim land and build a village for her community.

And he goes out on the jet ski with waterman Pomai Hoapili in the middle of the worldʻs most famous surfing competition – the Pipeline Pro.

Between surfing on the North Shore and rescuing people caught in the giant waves, Pomai has enrolled in Hawaiian language classes. He practices speaking with his 10-year-old daughter, who’s also learning.

He says it’s urgent for native Hawaiians to practice their culture.

“Be Hawaiian, speak Hawaiian live Hawaiian…If we stop down the line, people stop talking about us, we disappear...we’ve got to keep practicing.”

In Hawaii to compete in the Pipeline surfing competition, the world’s most famous  surfer Kelly Slater asks the world to pay respect.

“Everyone who comes Hawaiian should, should take care of this place and really respect the culture and the locals,” says Slater. “It's their home and it's your place to visit, but, you know, take care of it and look after it and ever one can enjoy it.”

Ukrainians woke up to find themselves plunged into the midst of war. Explosions and air raid sirens rang out here in Kyiv and cities across the country as Russia launched a full scale invasion on multiple fronts in the early hours of the morning, firing missiles at key military infrastructure sites.

(Subscribe: https://bit.ly/C4_News_Subscribe) 

Its troops are reported to be advancing from the north of Kyiv. 
Other cities that have been targeted include Odessa, the major port on the Black Sea, and there are reports of hundreds of explosions in Mariupol, which is located close to Russian-occupied territory.

But also in towns like Lutsk in Ukraine's west. It shows the breadth of the assault from the Russian military.

Ukraine has declared martial law, urging citizens to take up arms to defend their country. There are reports of heavy casualties already on both sides. And as the West threatened to cripple Moscow's economy with devastating sanctions, an ominous warning from Vladimir Putin to any country trying to interfere - you will face ""consequences you have never seen"", he declared.

783,sOUKc7KgJiU,DW News,"Ukraine forces push Russians out of Kharkiv as NATO, G7 hold talks on war | Ukraine Update",2022-05-14T10:05:17Z,25,"Russia's war on Ukraine is in the spotlight at high-level diplomatic talks in Germany. Foreign ministers from NATO countries are meeting over their long-term strategy. Ministers from Finland and Sweden are expected to meet their Turkish counterpart there, after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan indicated he may resist their bid to join the military alliance.
Meanwhile foreign ministers from Group of Seven nations are continuing their talks. They've pledged to support Ukraine ""until victory."" The spotlight there has been on food security concerns, with global supplies from Ukraine hit by Russian blockades.
German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who is hosting the G-7 meeting, said Russia was waging a ""food war"" on the world.
Ukrainian forces appear close to claiming victory over Russia's attempt to take the second largest city, Kharkiv. Western military analysts said Russian troops were withdrawing from areas around the city due to limited reinforcements and Ukrainian counterattacks. Despite the latest gains, President Volodomyr Zelenskyy used his nightly address to warn of a long war ahead. He said more than 1,000 settlements had now been deoccupied.
A Russian soldier has gone on trial in Kyiv, accused of committing war crimes during the first weeks of the invasion of Ukraine. The 21-year old is alleged to have shot an unarmed civilian in a car. It's the first trial of its kind, with Ukrainian prosecutors preparing cases against at least forty other soldiers and investigating thousands more possible war crimes.
Ukrainian and British officials say Russian forces have suffered heavy losses trying to cross a river in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine. Kyiv has released video it says shows the aftermath of a strike on a Russian pontoon bridge. Britain's defense ministry said Russia lost what it described as ""significant armored maneuver elements"" in the attack earlier this week.
Sweden's foreign minister says her country's accession to NATO would prevent conflicts in northern Europe. Ann Linde was presenting a parliamentary report on security as Sweden considers applying to join the alliance, in the face of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

One in 10 travellers world-wide is from China.

Outside of Asia, their destination of choice is France.

Despite complaints from locals, officials in Paris want to double the number of Chinese visitors to five million a year.

101 East asks what it will take to turn the plane loads of first-time travellers from China into well behaved sightseers.

At the urging of President Donald Trump, however, die-hard supporters are planning to descend on the nation's capital Jan. 6, to pressure Republican lawmakers into aligning themselves with the doomed effort to overturn Joe Biden's electoral victory.

Knife fights, shouting matches, and verbal harassment of Trump opponents accompanied previous demonstrations following Biden's election win in November. Now federal and local law enforcement are bracing for what may be the most intense Trump protest yet as Congress is poised to formally declare Biden president-elect.

This is part of a package worth $200 million, promised to Kiev last week by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The initial delivery includes defensive weapons and ammunition as the country prepares for possible Russian aggression. Such a form of deterrence is not endorsed by Germany, which has refused to supply weapons to Ukraine. The Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba says he's disappointed in Germany.
Moscow has deployed some 100,000 troops along its border with Ukraine, but insists it has no plans to launch an attack.

785,zjWaXog1xDU,DW News,Ukraine says it repelled Russian forces at battle in Kyiv suburbs | Ukraine latest,2022-03-22T08:26:48Z,25,"Ukraine claims it has retaken strategically important Kyiv suburb. The Ukrainian military said its troops have driven Russian forces out of Makariv, a town about 60 kilometers (37 miles) west of Kyiv. 
The strategically important town was the scene of a fierce battle and has sustained significant damage from Russian shelling, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said, adding its recapture prevents Russian forces from encircling the capital from the northwest. The ""state flag of Ukraine was raised over the city of Makariv"" as the Russians retreated, the ministry wrote in a post on Facebook. DW could not confirm the claim by the Ukraine forces.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine was willing to consider dropping its demands for full NATO membership in exchange for security guarantees. ""It's a compromise for everyone: for the West, which doesn't know what to do with us with regard to NATO, for Ukraine, which wants security guarantees, and for Russia, which doesn't want further NATO expansion,"" Zelenskyy said late Monday in an interview with Ukrainian television channels. Ukraine is well aware it cannot be admitted to NATO at the moment because they ""do not want to fight with Russia,"" Zelenskyy said, adding, ""Okay, what other security guarantees are possible?"" Zelenskyy was adamant that he needed to talk to Russian President Vladimir Putinin order to understand whether Russia even intends to stop the war. Putin has so far ignored Zelenskyy repeated requests for direct talks. On Monday, Zelenskyy said again that he is ready to meet Putin ""in any format"" but would also not bow to ultimatums from Russia to surrender. The president also suggested that after a cease-fire agreement, Kyiv would be ready to discuss the status of Crimea and the eastern Donbas region held by Russian-backed separatists. However, Zelenskyy said he plans to put any agreements reached with Russia to a nationwide referendum for public approval.

Russia's Foreign Ministry says it has withdrawn from peace treaty negotiations with Japan, as a result of  sanctions imposed by Tokyo over the invasion of Ukraine. ""Under the current conditions Russia does not intend to continue negotiations with Japan on a peace treaty,"" the foreign ministry said and cited Japan's ""openly unfriendly positions and attempts to damage the interests of our country."" Last week Japan announced plans to revoke Moscow's trade status and expand freezing of assets against Russian individuals. Russia and Japan have not officially ended World War II hostilities due to a dispute over islands north of Hokkaido. And Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida hit back at Russia's decision to withdraw from the peace treaty. ""The latest situation occurred as a result of Russia's aggression against Ukraine, and Russia's attempt to shift the issue to Japan-Russia relations is extremely unjustified and absolutely unacceptable,"" he said in parliament. Japan ""strongly protests,"" he added, condemning Russia for its actions to ""unilaterally change the status quo by force.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said again that he is ready to meet Russian leader Vladimir Putin ""in any format"" but would also not bow to ultimatums from Russia to surrender. Russian publication Komsomolskaya Pravda briefly published a casualty figure of nearly 10,000 deaths of Russian soldiers since the invasion of Ukraine on February 24 began, but then deleted it. US President Joe Biden says Vladimir Putin is considering the use of biological and chemical weapons as a false flag attack, based on US intelligence assessments. The Pentagon has accused Russian forces of committing war crimes in Ukraine and said it would help gather evidence of them. The European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Monday that Russia's attacks on the Ukrainian coastal city of Mariupol amount to a ""war crime."" German Christian Democratic Union (CDU) lawmaker Michael Brand called for sanctions against former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder over his strong links with Russia. Humanitarian organization Save the Children said upwards of 6 million children are in imminent danger as a growing number of hospitals and schools come under attack during Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. A Moscow court ruled in favor of Russia's FSB intelligence services on Monday, agreeing to label the US internet giant Meta (formerly Facebook) an ""extremist organization.""

Terry Hodson and Carl Williams were career criminals. Hodson was shot twice in the head by a killer who'd come to his home with no apparent sign of a break-in. Williams was bludgeoned to death while in jail.

Two murders - six years apart, both linked by key facts. Each was a police informant; both had made serious allegations of police corruption; both were killed with police acutely aware both men were in danger.

Despite the extraordinary circumstances of the deaths, it's still not clear who ordered their killing. To this day, no one has been convicted of the murder of Terrence Hodson and his wife Christine.",1603655.0,5576,1065.0,PT44M30S
786,QrBP3sydgXg,DW News,Russian forces take control over Europe's largest nuclear power plant | DW News,2022-03-04T07:55:48Z,25,"Russian forces have entered the site of Europe's largest nuclear power plant after a fire broke out there during Russian shelling. Ukrainian authorities say no radiation leaks have been detected.

Ukrainian authorities say Russian forces have taken control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the countries southeast. A fire broke out at one of the reactors at the site after Russian shelling overnight. ""Operational personnel are monitoring the condition of power units,"" the regional authority said on social media. It added that it sought to ensure the operations were in line with safety requirements.

Russian authorities have moved to restrict access to a number of international media websites, including that of Deutsche Welle, that they accuse of providing false information about Russia's attack on Ukraine. Websites of the BBC, the independent news website Meduza and the Russian-language website of the US-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Svoboda, were also ""limited"" following a request from prosecutors, according to Russian media watchdog Roskomnadzor. Deutsche Welle has been able to confirm that access to its website from Russia has been blocked since early Friday morning, and that its services can be used only by employing a VPN or circumvention tool.

The Ukrainian Embassy in Berlin has requested the German government provide Kyiv with tanks and warships to face down a Russian invasion. Additional items on Ukraine's list of requests include infantry fighting vehicles, artillery systems, such as self-propelled howitzers, air defense systems, combat and support helicopters, reconnaissance and combat drones and transport aircraft. Ukraine's formal request to the Chancellery, the Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry read in part, ""In view of the extremely tense security situation because of the ongoing Russian aggression, the Ukrainian government is seeking that this request be processed and favorably reviewed as quickly as possible."" The note adds Putin started a ""war of annihilation"" against Ukraine. Berlin reversed its defense and Russia policy of many decades seemingly overnight following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Germany has already provided 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger surface-to-air missiles after initially promising just 5,000 helmets.

980,iziFgZ8fq6U,The Sun,British Freedom Fighters join Ukraine's foreign legion vowing to fight against 'Russia's war crimes',2022-03-07T17:08:50Z,25,"Ukraine has established a foreign ""international"" legion for volunteers from abroad and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has publicly urged foreigners to ""fight side-by-side with Ukrainians against the Russian war criminals"" in order to show support for his country.

Last week, Zelenskyy said that more than 16,000 foreigners have answered his call.

Some of the foreign fighters in Ukraine say they were attracted by the cause: to halt an unprovoked attack they view as a once-in-a-generation showdown between the forces of democracy and dictatorship.

Standing outside the ticket hall of Lviv station on Sunday were a group of British men in military uniform, waiting for a train to Kyiv. They were in high spirits, often exchanging fist-bumps and handshakes with Ukrainian refugees who thanked them for fighting for their country.

They were led by Ben Grant, a strapping Englishman from Essex, who had just completed a month-long stint as a security advisor in Iraq. He was unclear whether his men would be deployed independently or as part of a Ukrainian unit.

""We're going to wait and see what the situation is as we get further in,"" said Grant. It's all going to depend on...where they need us.""

Another member of the group, an Englishman in his twenties who identified himself as Jax, said his family was proud but “not happy” that he had come to Ukraine.

Even those who have previously seen fighting might struggle in Ukraine's war zones warned a British soldier who identified himself only by his nickname, Kruger. He said he had served in the British military for seven years and was a veteran of Afghanistan who trained other soldiers.

""If you're out here as a war tourist, this is not the place for you,"" he said. ""The realities of war, if you head out to the front, are going to be pretty overwhelming.""

The Hollywood megastar has worked tirelessly behind the scenes to enforce tight social-distancing rules during the filming, taking place in Britain.

And he flew into a rage after spotting two of the crew standing within two metres of each other.

An audio tape captured Cruise shouting: “If I see you do it again, you’re f***ing gone. And if anyone in this crew does it, that’s it — and you too and you too. And you, don’t you ever f***ing do it again.”

Fifty members of staff at Warner Bros. Studios in Leavesden, Herts, were left stunned by the angry outburst.

1189,hSmAYUnZyxE,The Economist,How modern families increase social inequality,2019-11-18T16:35:20Z,25,"Modern families with two working adults are richer than those with a single breadwinner, and can afford to take a different approach to parenting. This is exacerbating inequality between rich and poor families.  Film supported by Mishcon de Reya

Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy 

The family has always been a central building block of society. But families have changed dramatically in the rich world over the past 50 years. Changes to society mean that the old model of a breadwinning husband and a stay-at-home wife has all but collapsed. And the different ways rich and poor families raise their children are increasing social inequality. Today, gay families like Maggie and Joelle’s are widely accepted in the rich world. A generation ago, it was almost unthinkable that same-sex couples would get married.But now most people in rich countries think gay marriage is fine. Fears that gay marriages would undermine heterosexual ones have proven unfounded. And this is one reason why marriage equality has spread so extraordinarily fast. Before 2001 gay marriage was not legal anywhere in the world. Since then, it’s been legalised in nearly all rich countries and developing nations are starting to follow suit. It’s a far cry from the 1960s, when families typically consisted of a dad who went to work a stay-at-home mum and three or more kids. Better access for women to contraception education and jobs has changed this traditional family portrait. Across the globe, families are shrinking. 
Nowhere more so than in South Korea. Here a growing number of women are rejecting marriage and having children altogether like Go Lee, who is 26. She says traditional employers make it hard to combine a career with marriage and motherhood. Go works in IT, but is also a vlogger on YouTube, where she urges South Korean women to be more assertive. She believes South Korean men are part of the problem

Many expect their wives to do all the housework and childcare, even if they have a job. There is a huge mismatch of expectations around marriage in South Korea. Most men want a 1950s-style relationship whereas women want something more modern and equal. The result is they often end up not marrying or having kids at all  and that’s left South Korea with a problem. Its population is in free fall. In 1960 the average South Korean woman had six children. In 2018 that figure shrank to less than one. A fertility rate of one means each generation is half as big as the previous one and in South Korea this means there are fewer workers to support the country’s ageing population. In rural areas, men are viewed as poor prospects by South Korean women. So the government is helping these men to find brides from poorer countries.


State-funded assimilation centres like this, teach immigrant brides how to cook Korean food how to speak Korean and even how to deal with Korean mothers-in-law. Like most of her classmates studying here today 19-year-old Nguyen Thi Cam Thuy is from Vietnam. She recently married a South Korean man 40-year-old Kim Dae Hyun who found her through a matchmaking website. Over a fifth of married South Korean farmers and fishermen have tied the knot with a foreigner. But cross-cultural unions can be difficult and around a fifth of marriages between South Korean men and foreign women end in divorce within four years. This video of a man beating his foreign wife caused widespread outrage. 50 years ago in most rich countries domestic violence was considered normal. Now, it is universally condemned and rates have fallen sharply by three-quarters in America alone, since the mid-1990s. 

Today, other factors are more likely to affect the stability of families and these are contributing to a growing gulf between middle-class and working-class families. In most rich countries, if you don’t go to university you are more likely to have kids outside of marriage. And women who don’t finish high school are more likely to end up as single mothers than women who have a degree. In Jamie’s hometown of Hartlepool in north-east England, 70% of babies are born outside marriage like her twins, Sean and Liam. In Hartlepool in the 1960s men did heavy work in shipyards and factories which was much better paid than any job their wives could find. So the women stayed at home with the kids. But as technology advances manual work has dried up and uneducated men have struggled to find good jobs. If the only men available lack steady jobs and don’t help around the home some women feel they are better off alone. Middle-class families have remained solid in rich countries over the past 50 years while working-class families have grown much less stable. Women with a university degree are more likely than women who do not finish high school to be married and raise children with their husband as a team.",1592026.0,28335,3651.0,PT18M36S

1355,229Fi8fOtho,CNBC Television,Coronavirus: Why Germany has been so successful in dealing with COVID-19,2020-04-13T19:56:15Z,25,"A look at why Germany has been so successful in dealing with the pandemic, and has been able to keep its coronavirus death rate so low, compared to other nations, with Jens Spahn, Germany's health minister.

The world is reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, and some countries are reeling more than others.

But Germany seems to be taking the epidemic in its stride with a high number of cases but a low number of deaths, thanks to a number of factors.

In Europe, while Italy and Spain are the worst hit countries with over 100,000 cases each, as of Friday, Germany has recorded 84,794 confirmed cases but has witnessed just 1,107 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

The low mortality rate in Germany, at just over 1%, is far below its neighboring European countries, and this has been put down to Germany’s decision to implement widespread testing of people suspected of having the virus, as opposed to Italy or the U.K.’s decision to only test symptomatic cases.

Karl Lauterbach, a professor of health economics and epidemiology at the University of Cologne, and a politician in the Social Democratic Party (SPD) of Germany, told CNBC that Germany’s less severe experience of the pandemic so far was down to a handful of factors.

“I think so far we’ve been lucky because we were hit by the wave of new infections later than many other European countries, for example Italy, Spain and France,” he told CNBC Thursday.

With over 24 million downloads, it has grown to become the paper’s most popular podcast ever, with millions of listeners across Europe and the Atlantic.

To mark a year of war, we recorded a special video version of the podcast with its three core presenters – David Knowles, Dominic Nicholls, and Francis Dearnley – to reflect on the last 12 months and to answer questions submitted by listeners. They are joined by Aliona Hlivco, a former Ukrainian MP, and Oksana Zabuzhko, renowned Ukrainian novelist and essayist.

Earlier, Ukraine's armed forces command said Russia's main efforts were focused on establishing complete control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, with military action also intensifying in Kharkiv.

The city has been considered a safe haven as it is relatively less affected by the fighting than other parts of Ukraine. Reporting from Lviv, DW correspondent Emmanuelle Shaze said there was ""infrastructure"" in the city that would be of interest to Russian forces.

More than 10,000 civilians have been killed in the weeks-long bombardment. Moscow estimates around 2,500 Ukrainian soldiers are holding out at a huge steel plant. Russia's defense ministry says it will destroy those who continue to resist. Ukraine's prime minister says the city has not fallen, and its forces will fight to the end.
But Russia has taken significant losses in its war against Ukraine, including a third of its generals, most recently General Vladimir Frolov, and its Black Sea flagship, the Moskva. DW spoke with former military intelligence officer Frank Ledwidge about what this says about Russia's military and its leadership.

275,xQzLFmIxHlw,Al Jazeera English,BR Shetty and the Missing Millions | Al Jazeera World,2020-08-05T08:33:51Z,25,"This is a story of a financial scandal, of fortunes won and lost and political collusion in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) that goes right to the heart of Emirati business and politics.

At the centre of it is a self-made Indian billionaire - Dr BR Shetty.

As founder of New Medical Centre Health (NMC), Shetty built relationships with the UAE's all-powerful sheikhs that appeared to open doors. Business was booming and, in 2012, NMC was the first Abu Dhabi company to be listed on the London Stock Exchange. The Initial Public Offering (IPO) raised $186m and raised NMC's market value to more than $8bn.

The first rumblings of financial trouble, however, came in December 2019 when an American investment firm published a damning report on NMC's finances. NMC's shares plummeted by 48 percent, wiping $1.5bn off the Shetty family fortune.

In April 2020, NMC Health went into administration in the United Kingdom for insolvency. Later that month, the UAE Central Bank ordered the seizure of all of Shetty and his family's assets and Shetty left the country. He now sees himself as the victim, claiming alleged fraud and misconduct within NMC - and has promised to clear his name and restore his business reputation.",1549159.0,8669.0,1325.0,PT45M17S

It’s supposed to remember and respect the Second World War generation, but Putin and Soviet leaders before him have used it as a means of expressing power and prestige.

So it was surprising that the only tank on the parade was an 80-year-old T-34 from the Second World War.

Should we laugh at such a poor display of Russian military might? How powerful is Russia's armed forces and how can we objectively assess the state of Putin’s army?

1356,qCRZHnX7PwY,CNBC Television,"WHO, vaccine makers move quickly against new omicron Covid variant",2021-11-27T00:28:11Z,25,"CNBC's Meg Tirrell reports on the latest data from the omicron covid variant, which the World Health Organization has labeled a ""variant of concern."" For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi 

The World Health Organization on Friday labeled a new heavily mutated strain of Covid-19 a variant of concern.

“This variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning,” the WHO said in a statement released Friday. “Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant, as compared to other VOCs.”

The variant, first known as B.1.1.529 and now named omicron, has been detected in small numbers in South Africa, WHO officials said. However, the number of omicron cases “appears to be increasing” in almost all of South Africa’s provinces, the WHO reported on Friday. The omicron variant has since been found in the U.K., Israel, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Hong Kong.

Here’s what we know so far:

Multiple mutations

South African scientist Tulio de Oliveira said in a media briefing held by the South Africa Department of Health on Thursday that the variant contains a “unique constellation” of more than 30 mutations to the spike protein, the component of the virus that binds to cells. This is significantly more than those of the delta variant.

Many of these mutations are linked to increased antibody resistance, which may affect how the virus behaves with regard to vaccines, treatments and transmissibility, health officials have said.

De Oliveira said the variant contains around 50 mutations in total. The receptor binding domain, the part of the virus that first makes contact with cells, has 10 mutations, far greater than just two for the delta Covid variant, which spread rapidly earlier this year to become the dominant strain worldwide.

This level of mutation means it’s possible that it came from a single patient who could not clear the virus, giving it the chance to genetically evolve. The same hypothesis was proposed for the alpha Covid variant.

Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s technical lead on Covid-19, said in a livestreamed Q&A on Thursday that scientists “don’t know very much about this yet” and that it would take a few weeks to gain a full picture of how the variant reacts to existing vaccines.

‘Most significant variant’ to date

The U.K. immediately moved to ban flights from South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, Namibia, Eswatini and Zimbabwe from noon Friday to 4 a.m. local time Sunday.

The U.K. Health Security Agency is investigating the variant, which Health Secretary Sajid Javid said is “potentially concerning.” No cases have yet been identified in the U.K., and Javid emphasized that although more data is needed at this early stage, the government had opted to take precautions.

“This is the most significant variant we have encountered to date and urgent research is underway to learn more about its transmissibility, severity and vaccine-susceptibility,” said U.K. HSA Chief Executive Jenny Harries.

Israel has also barred travel to several southern African nations over the new variant, as well as Singapore and other nations. Israel has reported one case of the new variant in a traveler returning from Malawi.

Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett met with health experts Friday to discuss the country’s response, which could reportedly include declaring a state of emergency.

Belgium on Friday afternoon became the first European country to report a case of the B.1.1.529 variant.

790,9x_frrL8Pas,DW News,Economy in crisis: Russia hit hard by international sanctions | DW News,2022-02-28T15:16:20Z,25,"Russia's escalating war in Ukraine has prompted unprecedented economic sanctions against the country. Over the weekend, Russian banks were further cut off from the international financial system. Some have been excluded from the SWIFT payments system while moves have been made to stop the Russian central bank using its $630 billion (€562 billion) of foreign reserves. The sanctions are by far the most severe to have been leveled at Russia since the country invaded Ukraine last week. The country's increasing financial and political isolation is already causing significant consequences for the economy, the 11th-largest in the world by GDP.

Russia's currency, the ruble, fell by around 30% to record lows after the latest sanctions, although it did recover a little in recent hours. That compounds massive losses already experienced last week. In response, the Russian central bank has made an emergency decision to hike interest rates from 9.5% to 20%. The bank has also temporarily blocked the sale of securities held by foreigners. The currency collapse has led to long lines outside ATMs across Russia, with fears rising over further plunges in the value of the ruble. On Monday, the central bank announced that the Moscow Stock Exchange would not open. It also said in a statement that it has increased interest rates to support ""financial and price stability and protect the savings of citizens from depreciation.""

1192,nA_p4--ZFIo,The Economist,Instagram playboy is also the vice-president of Equatorial Guinea,2017-10-25T16:35:04Z,25,"Equatorial Guinea’s vice-president records his lavish lifestyle on Instagram, but it is unclear where his money comes from. He is currently being tried for embezzlement and money-laundering in France, where a verdict will be announced this week.

Meet one of Instagram's most famous playboys. He tours the world, driving fast cars and eating at the world's finest restaurants. He even gets hip-hop stars like Wyclef Jean to play at his lavish parties posting his exploits on his Instagram account. But this isn't your typical Instagram star.

He's the vice-president of a country, Equatorial Guinea. A small country in west Africa with a lot of oil.

Teodoro Nguema Obiang is the second-most-powerful man in the country. His father is the world's longest serving president, Teodoro Obiang Nguema. The Obiang family has amassed a fortune running into the hundreds of millions of dollars. But how have they made their money?

Equatorial Guinea has some of the most opaque national accounts in the world. Per head it is the richest country in Africa, yet people live in plastic-shack poverty. The most recent figures available from the World Bank suggest that three-quarters of the population live below the poverty line. But the presidential family seem oblivious to the poverty.

If the country is so wealthy, where is all the money going?

Tutu Alicante is a lawyer from Equatorial Guinea who is in exile in the United States. He runs an organisation that is trying to tackle corruption in his homeland. He knows first hand how the massive theft of public money has left little behind to fund public services.

While most of the population live in squalid conditions, Teddy splashes the cash, showing off his wealth on his Instagram account. Often using the hashtag luxury living he reveals a life of privilege and excess. Court papers say he amassed around $300m worldwide between 2000 and 2011, despite having an official government salary of less than $100,000 a year.

The Department of Justice alleged that Teddy embezzled millions of dollars from the public purse as cabinet minister. The Department of Justice agreed a settlement of around $30m with Teddy.

This year Teddy has found himself on trial again. This time in a separate case in France charged with embezzlement and money-laundering. After being unsuccessful in claiming diplomatic immunity he failed to show up to any of the court hearings. Instead, he posted videos on Instagram of himself on safari near Victoria Falls.

The French court valued his assets in France at around €100m, including a large property bought for €25m in Paris. The French public prosecutor has asked for a three-year jail sentence, €30m fine, and all of Teddy's assets in France to be seized. 

The vice-president denies the charges.

The future for Equatorial Guinea looks bleak. The president is ageing and his son is preparing to take over. The spendthrift strongmen of Equatorial Guinea are not the only presidential family in Africa who are under investigation for embezzling from the public purse. The presidents of Gabon and the Republic of Congo are also being investigated by judges in France.

But Teddy's had a busy time of late posting from the beaches of Brazil to the Great Wall of China. There are plenty of countries where regulators turn a blind eye to despots who want to hide their ill-gotten gains. But their secrets are increasingly being leaked and it helps if the autocrats themselves do the leaking, via Instagram.

Over the first 100 days of the war, many lives have been lost or forever changed. 

More than six million refugees have fled the country they call home. 

In response, over the past three months, Global News correspondents have criss-crossed the country, reporting from more than a dozen towns and cities, as well as neighbouring nations. 

Jeff Semple hosts this Global News special from the city of Kharkiv, which now stands as a testament to Ukrainian resilience -- that has taken Russia and the world by surprise.

The Kremlin is seeking to capture the industrial Donbas region, but many observers say that Russian gains are smaller than expected. Ukraine has admitted heavy losses in the east, but says Russian casualties are far higher. Evidence of Russian brutality under Vladimir Putin has shocked western officials - even those with military backgrounds.
On March 4th, eight days after Russia invaded Ukraine, Russian forces took control of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. The Russians have kept the Zaporizhzhia plant running – with Ukrainian staff. But there have been reports of Russian troops forcing engineers to work under extreme pressure. 
There are also concerns that fighting near the plant has caused damage or could cause a nuclear accident. Ukraine says Russia sent eight specialists from its state nuclear company to the plant, where they demanded managers give them confidential data about its operation. The head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, has urged international nuclear specialists be granted access to the plant as soon as possible.
And Russia has been relentlessly bombarding Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-biggest city, for weeks. Most people there have left, but many remain.

It comes as a state of emergency has been declared in Ontario, the province which includes Ottawa, after protests entered their third week in the capital.

Protesters have been warned they face large fines or even prison time for their continued demonstrations.

Mr Murray condemned Mr Trudeau for his treatment of the protesters, saying he called them ""racists, misogynists and homophobes"".

""He and his appalling supporting paper, the Toronto Star, pump out the most vicious propaganda against these truckers.""

The House Jan. 6 committee announced an previously unplanned hearing for June 28, promising new evidence and witness testimony.

Committee members did not confirm a focus for Tuesday's hearing, scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. ET. But it will likely lean heavily on the testimony of Cassidy Hutchinson, a senior aide to former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, the NewsHour and other media outlets confirmed.

In the course of her work for the White House, Hutchinson had firsthand insight into communications between Meadows and former President Donald Trump, including those leading up to the insurrection and in the days afterward.

In the year since its creation, the committee has conducted more than 1,000 interviews, seeking critical information and documents from people witness to, or involved in, the violence that day.

Additional hearings are expected in July.

792,ij0X1K54yEM,DW News,Russia out of Kharkiv + Ukraine wins ESC + NATO meets in Berlin | Ukraine Update,2022-05-15T13:30:14Z,25,"After weeks of heavy bombardment, Kharkiv is breathing a sigh of relief. The Ukrainian military claims to have driven Russian troops out of the area around the country's second-largest city. The shelling, according to regional authorities, has stopped. But Ukraine's president says his forces elsewhere still lack the means to tip the scales in their favor. Volodomyr Zelenskyy told a visiting U.S. Senate delegation he needs more powerful weapons. 
And in a victory on stage, the Ukrainian band Kalush Orchestra has won the Eurovision Song Contest. The group was a favorite going into the final round with their song Stefania, which blends traditional folk music with modern-day hip-hop. The band was in fourth place after the jury voted, but swept to victory thanks to overwhelming support from fans across Europe.  
Usually, Ukrainian TV would broadcast the competition from a studio in Kyiv. But after the war broke out, producers moved the broadcast to a secret location underground. DW correspondent Amien Essif joined the crew on what was to be a very special night.
Foreign ministers from NATO countries are in Berlin for talks dominated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Representatives from Sweden and Finland are ALSO in town to discuss their intentions to gain membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But not all NATO members are keen to let the Scandinavian countries become part of the defense alliance.

Senator Thorpe took to the Senate chamber last week to target the NT attorney general, and said she hoped “he listens to these experts” on indigenous incarceration given “he didn’t read the royal commission”.

Northern Territory Attorney General Selena Uibo responded in force to Senator Thorpe’s comments, and said she had “pointers” for her and any “other southern politician” who wanted to use the NT as a “punching bag for their own political point scoring”.

“One, get your facts straight,” she said.

“The Northern Territory attorney general is not a white man, I am an aboriginal woman”.

Ms Panahi said Selena Uibo gave Senator Thorpe a “nice working over” where she “called her out” for some of her appearances in rural and remote communities.",1442851.0,29469,3412,PT3M14S
983,H6uingtAWbk,The Sun,Biden’s biggest gaffes and failures after one year in office,2022-01-20T16:00:18Z,25,"ON January 20, 2021, Joe Biden vowed to overcome Covid and pledged America would ""lead by example"" in the world following years of unpredictability during the Trump administration

But, during his first year in office, the US has been blighted by foreign policy blunders in Afghanistan and is facing the prospect of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.

And back home, the US is in a fight against the highly transmissible Omicron Covid-19 variant. 

Polling paints a grim picture for the Biden administration as 62 percent disapprove of the president’s handling of the economy, while 69 percent say the White House’s Covid messaging has been confusing. 

And, US party preferences appear to have shifted as 47 percent say they are either strong or lean Republican - a seven-point rise compared to the first quarter of 2021, according to Gallup.

Meanwhile, only 42 percent of Americans identify themselves as strong or lean Democrats, down from 49 percent at the start of 2021.

The last time the GOP held a five-point lead in party advantage was 1995 when they had just taken control of the House for the first time since the 1950s.

The Sun takes a look at the crises that have plagued the Biden Administration in his first year in office.

The arrival of the choppers was first announced last week, when it was billed as a participation to the bi-annual international U.S.-led exercise Saber Strike.

But on Thursday the Lithuanian defence minister was describing them as part of U.S. military reinforcements to the Baltic region after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Some forty U.S. service members arrived in Latvia from Italy earlier on Thursday, the first group of what is expected to be a deployment of more than 300 troops, the Latvian Defence Ministry said.

883,7u4ocGJ9ZXI,PBS NewsHour,WATCH LIVE: Jan. 6 Committee hearings - Day 3,2022-06-16T20:49:44Z,25,"Warning: This hearing may include footage of violence.

The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack will hold its third public hearing June 16, focused on former President Donald Trump's efforts to pressure former Vice President Mike Pence to reject Congress' official count of Electoral College votes on the day of the attack. 

The hearing is scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. ET on Thursday, June 16.

The  vice president is charged with overseeing the Electoral College vote count -- already certified by individual states -- in a joint session of Congress following a presidential election. Trump called on Pence repeatedly to reject the results confirming President Joe Biden's win, telling supporters in a rally hours before the attack that ""it will be a sad day for the country"" if his vice president did not come through. Pence said in a statement after the speech he did not have the constitutional authority to do what the president asked. Some rioters began chanting ""hang Mike Pence.""  Committee member Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said at the start of the hearings that upon hearing this,  Trump said ""maybe our supporters have the right idea.""

The committee postponed a hearing scheduled for June 15 that was meant to focus on Trump's efforts to replace Attorney General Bill Barr, who did not support his claims of voter fraud after the election. Members of the committee said this week they thought they had evidence to indict Trump for seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which they will lay out as part of several public hearings this month.

What will be the biggest stories of the year ahead? 

00:35 - 10 - Powered Clothing
In 2019 power dressing will take on a whole new meaning when this strange-looking clothing hits the market. Not so much high fashion as high tech, it's a suit with built-in power that will literally get people moving. Part of the wearable robotics revolution, the suit is made up of battery-powered muscle packs which contract just like a human muscle to boost the wearer's strength. With the global population of over 60s expected to more than double by 2050, and retirement age increasing, there's no shortage of potential markets. But don't expect the suits to ease the burden on aching limbs and overstretched health services anytime soon - as these suits don't come cheap. According to the manufacturer they'll retail for around the cost of a bespoke tailored suit. 

02:13 - 9 - The year of cheap flights
2019 will be the year low-cost long-haul travel takes off. You'll be able to buy a ten thousand mile flight from London to Sydney for around $350 and this is why. The world will boast two new state-of-the-art mega hub airports and competition between them will drive down the cost of flying. Daxing Airport outside Beijing is due to open in 2019 and will feed growing demand for air travel in China. Beijing already has one of the world's biggest airports and for China this new mega hub will send an important message to the world. Rivaling Daxing as a national symbol of global prestige will be a new mega hub airport in Istanbul. Opened in 2018 it covers a staggering 26 square miles - an area larger than the island of Manhattan. And in 2019 consumers will again be the beneficiaries of a state sponsored economic push. But the low fares offered by competition between these hubs could be short-lived. 

04:06 - 8 Stonewall riots at 50
In 2019 LGBT communities will mark the anniversary of a seminal event - it will be 50 years since patrons at New York gay bar, The Stonewall Inn, resisted police attempts to arrest them. The resulting Stonewall riots kick-started the modern gay rights movement. In many countries the laws that continue to allow intolerance and inequality have their roots in religion. But one former British colony has given hope to the global movement for change. In 2018 India decriminalized homosexuality and gay rights campaigners hope 2019 will be the year other former British colonies follow suit. In February Kenya's High Court will rule on whether to decriminalize same-sex intimacy which is currently punishable with up to 14 years in prison. Campaigners hope that decriminalization could start a domino effect across Africa. 

06:28 - 7 Driverless Cars
With GM launching its driverless taxi service and Waymo expanding its Robotaxis to new cities 2019 will be the year the driverless car revolution hits the road. It was hit 1980s TV show Knight Rider that popularized self-driving cars controlled by artificial intelligence. Since then, billions of dollars of investment have fueled the drive to turn the idea into reality. Dubai has committed to a quarter of all trips being driverless by 2030 and the driverless car industry will be worth a predicted $550bn by 2026. But the advance of driverless cars could be held up by a red flag - as in March of 2018 the first person was killed by a self-driving car. But manufacturers are confident that the inevitable progress of technology will win over the skeptics.

08:49 - 6 Celebrating da Vinci
May 2019 will mark 500 years since the death of the greatest polymath in global history, Leonardo da Vinci. Leonardo painted the world's most expensive picture The Salvator Mundi which was auctioned for $450 million but he was also a brilliant scientist and engineer. In 2019 his art and notebooks will be taking center stage at blockbuster exhibitions. Leonardo sketched out designs for inventions that followed centuries later such as scuba equipment and the tank. And in 2019 another of his designs will be getting a new lease of life as a flying car becomes commercially available. The car flies thanks to folding helicopter blades which are derived from Leonardo's invention the aerial screw. Leonardo was the original outsider. Five centuries after his death there are still simple lessons he can teach today's divided world.

...

JOE CONCHA: Let’s just remove all the noise. Democrats need 50 votes in the Senate to pass this bill. Kamala Harris serves as the tiebreaker, they have 48. The math also extends to inflation. You’ve talked about it before. The CBO says Build Back Better will add, what $3 trillion to the deficit? And most sane economists say that will make inflation, currently at what, a 40 year high, even worse. So maybe just maybe those covering the story might want to explore that angle a little bit more in its coverage. Finally, more hard numbers and I’ll leave it here: Joe Biden is currently polling at 65% disapproval in West Virginia. That’s the state Manchin represents. Three quarters of people living in that state oppose the Build Back Better bill. Add it all up and Manchin is simply using common sense here.

1145,TkXH8ewWPSE,Sky News Australia,College student rips into CNN anchor over the network’s ‘disinformation’,2022-04-08T03:19:45Z,25,"A college student has ripped into CNN’s Brian Stelter for being “right up there” on delivering false narratives after members of the liberal media accused Fox News of being a “purveyor of disinformation”. 

The CNN anchor was a guest at the University of Chicago’s panel discussion on ‘Disinformation and the Erosion of Democracy’ when a college student didn’t hold back arguing the network had made several mistakes including failing to report on the Hunter Biden laptop story. 

 “You’ve all spoken extensively about Fox News being a purveyor of disinformation but CNN is right up there with them,” college freshman Christopher Phillips said.

“With mainstream corporate journalists becoming a little more than apologists and cheerleaders for the regime, is it time to finally declare that the cannon of journalistic ethics is dead or no longer operative?

“All the mistakes of the mainstream media – CNN in particular – seem to magically all go in one direction. Are we expected to believe that this is all just some sort of random coincidence or is there something else behind it?”

Brian Stelter replied joking it was “time for lunch” before defending his network.

“I think my honest answer to you – and I will come over and we will talk in more detail after this – is that I think you’re describing a different channel than the one that I watch.”",1418989.0,52809,14202,PT5M41S

RELATED: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0YKHrrSxKw

The mayor appealed for calm Thursday as the city released body camera videos of last month's fatal shooting of Adam Toledo, 13, by a Chicago police officer - an incident that appears to show Adam's hands in the air when he was shot.

According to one officer's bodycam video, he pulls up in a car, gets out, pushes past another man and runs down an alley shouting ""stop"" toward Adam, who is dressed in jeans, a sweatshirt and white baseball cap. Adam runs away from the officer, then slows down and pauses near a fence.

Adam can be seen tossing what appeared to be a gun behind the fence as he slows down, according to surveillance video shot from across a parking lot. The video shows the gun coming to rest on the backside of the fence.

Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy 
This protester calls himself “Bruce”. We’ve hidden his face and obscured his voice to protect his identity. He’s one of the millions of Hong Kongers taking to the streets. 

What started as a protest against an extradition bill has become the most serious challenge to the Communist Party’s authority since the Tiananmen Square protest three decades ago. As the demonstrations enter a third month neither the government nor the protesters is willing to back down.

But it’s not enough to deter the demonstrators. So what happens now?

Hong Kong is one of the most important financial centres in the world. And it has a unique status. It’s a city in China but it’s not entirely Chinese. It has its own currency, its own passport… its own legal system. There’s even a boundary between Hong Kong and the rest of China and you need a permit to cross it. This is all down to its history.

In 1842 Hong Kong was ceded by the Chinese to the British after the first Opium War. But in 1997 Britain gave it back to China. With one important condition - for 50 years Hong Kong was to be governed under what is known as “one country, two systems”. The chief executive who runs Hong Kong would be appointed by a pro-Chinese committee. But the city was guaranteed a high degree of autonomy with its own government, legal system and economic independence until 2047. Over the past decade those rights have been eroded.

Fuller democracy, promised as part of the handover agreement has yet to be granted by China. 

China’s grip has got ever tighter. In 2012 the government tried to install a patriotic pro-Chinese education system. Then five Hong Kong booksellers who sold material banned in mainland China disappeared. In 2016 pro-democracy opposition leaders were thrown out of Hong Kong’s parliament for insulting China when swearing their oaths. And then in February this year the government introduced a bill which would have allowed extradition to the mainland.

All this is fuelling the protesters’ anger.

As the protests get larger and more violent the chance of China intervening increases. Beijing has made thinly veiled threats to send in its military forces - the People’s Liberation Army.

In 1989 a student demonstration in Beijing ended in massacre. Hundreds, maybe thousands, were shot dead. For the Chinese government the Hong Kong demonstrators are defying the authority of a Communist leadership that cannot tolerate defiance. Another fear is some protesters’ demand for full independence. But military intervention would be a very risky strategy for Beijing

In 1993 Hong Kong’s GDP accounted for more than a quarter of mainland China’s. Today China’s remarkable rise means that Hong Kong’s economic output makes up less than 3% of the mainland’s. But Hong Kong remains important for China. Multinationals use it as a launch pad to the mainland and it gives Chinese companies access to the rest of the world.

So how the turmoil is resolved matters to more than just the people of Hong Kong. 

This all comes at a time when China and America are waging a trade and technology war. Bloodshed on Hong Kong’s streets would make relations deteriorate even further. Beijing is now blaming outsiders for the trouble.

For China the situation has become much more than a dispute over a law. It’s become an existential threat. Bruce and the other protesters are holding their breath.

China’s Communist rulers must choose between two mortal dangers - the collapse of economic stability and prosperity, or the acceptance that protests can limit the Party’s absolute power.

277,U2K-afWJbXY,Al Jazeera English,Malaysia: Power and Corruption | 101 East,2019-05-09T09:55:31Z,25,"In 2018, after more than 60 years being ruled by the same party, Malaysians voted out Najib Razak and his government - the catalyst, the disappearance of billions of dollars of public funds involving Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund, 1MDB.

Police raids on Najib's family homes after the election seized more than $270m  worth of cash and luxury goods including Hermes Birkin handbags worth in excess of $10m and 12,000 pieces of jewellery - valued at more than $100m.

For internationally acclaimed Malaysian cartoonist Zunar, none of this came as a surprise. For years, his cartoons portrayed images of government corruption and the extravagance of Najib's wife, Rosmah.

Under Najib's government, Zunar faced nine criminal charges for his cartoons, carrying sentences totalling more than 43 years in jail - such was the crackdown on those who dared to speak out.

Now a free man, he says that Rosmah had been ""the most powerful person in Malaysia"" when she was First Lady.

A controversial Malaysian businessman, Deepak Jaikishan, who claims to have been Rosmah's confidant and her and Najib's business partner, backs up Zunar. Accusing the couple of benefitting from government deals, he says, ""It went to a point where every project had to go through her. Any cabinet minister who defied her or dared to voice out against her was just x-ed off. You could say she's the de facto prime minister.""

Najib currently faces more than 40 criminal charges, from money laundering to abuse of power, while his wife Rosmah faces 19 charges for money laundering and tax evasion. Both continue to deny all charges.

101 East lifts the curtain on the alleged corruption of the former Prime Minister, Najib Razak, and his wife, Rosmah, and investigates how key institutions were rendered powerless as the nation's coffers were robbed.

278,SuplOE5JB4M,Al Jazeera English,The Caliph P2: Division | Featured Documentary,2016-07-22T08:07:53Z,24,"The Caliph - Part 2: Division - Featured Documentary 

For almost 13 centuries, from the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 to the overthrow of the last Ottoman caliph in 1924, the Islamic world was ruled by a caliph.
 
Translated from the Arabic ‘Khalifa’, the word ‘caliph’ means successor or deputy.
The caliph was considered the successor to the Prophet Muhammad.
 
It is a term that has, at times, been abused.
 
In June 2014, a militant group calling itself the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (known as ISIL or ISIS) declared the establishment of a caliphate and proclaimed its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, a caliph. This proclamation was rejected by the overwhelming majority of the world’s Muslims.
 
ISIL had attempted to appropriate a title imbued with religious and political significance – and in doing so had cast a dark shadow over a rich history.
 
This is the story of the caliph, a title that originated 1,400 years ago and that spanned one of the greatest empires the world has ever known.

In this episode of The Caliph, Al Jazeera tells the story of the caliphate, looking at the Sunni-Shia divide, and how this split arose from a dispute over who should succeed the Prophet Muhammad.

885,YZPBWZcr-vw,PBS NewsHour,WATCH LIVE: Jan. 6 Committee hearings - Day 4,2022-06-21T21:01:39Z,25,"Warning: This hearing may include footage of violence and strong language.

The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack will hold its fourth public hearing June 21, focused on former President Donald Trump's efforts to pressure state legislators and local election officials to change the results of the 2020 presidential election.

The hearing is scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. ET on Tuesday, June 21.

The hearing comes after the committee on Thursday, June 16 laid out evidence on how Trump pressured his then- vice president, Mike Pence, to overturn the election, even as the Capitol insurrection was underway. The June 16 hearing played out testimony from several aides and close Trump allies that all testified to the pressure that the president was putting on Pence. The vice president is charged with overseeing the Electoral College vote count -- already certified by individual states -- in a joint session of Congress following a presidential election-- that is what was taking place on Jan. 6, 2021. Pence said on that day that he did not have the constitutional authority to do what the president had asked.

Members of the committee said last week they thought they had evidence to indict Trump for seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which they will lay out as part of several public hearings this month.

In US news and current events today, the phenomenon known as never Trump Republicans, or Republican Voters Against Trump, also known as RVAT, are becoming a force to be reckoned with in the upcoming election 2020. President Trump has turned off a sizable portion of the Republican base, and as President, Donald Trump is know a known entity rather than the unknown he was before he became President Donald J. Trump. For these never Trumpers, the threat of another Trump term is very real, which is why they are speaking out against President Donald Trump.

678,box4SFtGvA0,CBS News,Esports: Inside the relentless training of professional gaming stars,2018-12-24T00:58:46Z,25,"Professional, competitive video game playing—the phenomenon known as esports—has seen double digit growth for much of the past decade. With a massive following, many say it will soon become an official Olympic event. Throughout the U.S., high schools are launching competitive gaming clubs, and even some colleges are offering scholarships to top players.

It’s a dream come true for professional esports players—traveling the world and paid salaries to play video games full time for a living.

But as money continues to pour into the industry, the pressure on these young pros—many still in their teens—is leading to early burnout from high stress, repetitive stress injuries, and grueling practice schedules.

In this episode of CBSN Originals, we follow pro esports players Doublelift (League of Legends) and Space (Overwatch) as they compete for glory, get an inside look at what it takes to be pro, and explore the risks many are taking to stay at the top.

Looking like a superhero, Franky Zapata successfully completed the famed 35-kilometer (22-mile) journey in just 22 minutes Sunday morning, reaching speeds of up to 177 kilometers per hour (110 mph) on the flyboard that has made him a French household name.
 
Propelled by a power pack full of kerosene, Zapata set off from Sangatte in France's Pas de Calais region and landed in St. Margaret's Bay, beyond the white cliffs of Dover, in southeast England. He stopped only once, on the British side, to refuel his futuristic invention from a boat in the choppy waters.

984,MphekPhEjYo,The Sun,Jeremy Clarkson’s Farm exclusive tour & why you should buy British,2021-09-15T12:30:03Z,25,"HE has become Britain’s most famous farmer – and its unlikeliest – since his TV documentary Clarkson’s Farm became a smash hit.

Now petrolhead Jeremy Clarkson is finding out what it really takes to make a living from the land. And it is far harder — and more frustrating — than belting around in a half-a-million-pound supercar on his other TV show, The Grand Tour.

Teaming up with the National Farmers’ Union (NFU), Jeremy wants the Government to commit to Britain remaining at least 60 per cent self-sufficient in food. It has slipped from nearly 80 per cent in the 1980s.

Helping to launch the NFU’s new Food Report, Jeremy is also asking shoppers to buy British products, which he insists are better quality and greener.

He gave the Sun an exclusive tour of the Diddly Squat farm and showed off several new additions to his estate.

985,hVs3gFmHa-o,The Sun,40-mile Russian convoy headed to Kyiv has 'virtually stalled for over a week',2022-03-09T11:44:08Z,25,"The 40-mile (64 km) long Russian military column convoy heading toward Kyiv has ""virtually stalled for over a week and sits about 15 miles out from the city"", said The Washington Post.

""Mechanical breakdown, congestion and morale issues, plus food and fuel supplies running low"", are cited by the BBC as contributing factors to the extremely slow progress.

“Additionally, one former commander of the U.K. Joint Forces Command, told the BBC command and control issues such as faulty radio networks are likely to be causing bigger problems.”

“The Associated Press, meanwhile, reports that Ukrainian resistance may also account for some of the slowdown, with one senior U.S. defense official saying Ukrainian troops have been targeting the convoy with ground fire, including shoulder-fired Javelin anti-tank missiles, and essentially creating roadblocks when vehicles at the front of the convoy are struck.”

“Alternatively, though, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby has suggested that the vehicles, which he says are largely meant for ‘resupply’ purposes, could be deliberately paused as the Russians regroup themselves.”

“Cited by The Washington Post last week, the director of the Security and Defense Studies Program at Turkish think tank EDAM[a], added detail to that suggestion, explaining the convoy’s delay could be partially the result of Russia’s attempt to move away from a failed plan to ‘decapitate’ the Ukrainian government quickly.”

“The Russian forces are instead now trying to transition to ‘Soviet-type heavy fire power and armor-focused operations,’ he said.”

“Going further, the former head of the British Army, General Lord Dannatt, told the BBC ‘This enormous column ... will encircle and lay siege to the capital,’ Kyiv, where the New Yorker reported last week that thousands of those residents still in the city are seeking shelter every night in its metro system.”

These restrictions have caused confusion as some police forces have fined dog walkers or people going out on unnecessary drives. Peter Hitchens thinks people are overreacting to the outbreak and the lockdown is not useful but Piers argues the UK is not going far enough to curb the spread of the virus.

987,RwaxSarKj-c,The Sun,US Forces load Howitzers bound for Ukraine,2022-05-03T14:10:42Z,25,"More than half of the M777 howitzer artillery units promised to Ukraine by the Pentagon have been delivered, according to US Defence officials.

Video, released by the US Air Force, shows Marines and Air Force personnel loading artillery on a C-17 Globemaster III at March Air Reserve base, in California, on April 26.

In April, the US announced it would send a total of 90 howitzers to support Ukraine defend itself from Russia’s invasion, along with nearly 184,000 shells. As of April 29, defense officials said that around 60 percent of the units were already on the ground in the country. The Pentagon says the howitzers would be “very effective” in fighting in the eastern Donbas region, where Russia has refocused much of its military effort.

798,f9TBvq_ZqBc,DW News,Russia claims 'first stage' of Ukraine war is a success | DW News,2022-03-26T10:00:24Z,25,"While Russia says its invasion of Ukraine has entered a new phase, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated his call for peace talks with Russia to end the war. Zelenskyy has called on energy-rich countries to increase their output to prevent Moscow from using its oil and gas supplies to ""blackmail"" other nations. Zelenskyy also noted that Muslims in Ukraine would have to fight during the upcoming holy fasting month of Ramadan. ""We have to ensure this sacred month of Ramadan is not overshadowed by the misery of people in Ukraine,'' he said. Zelenskyy made the comments during a surprise video appearance at the Doha Forum in Qatar, a leading exporter of natural gas. He told the international conference that no country was safeguarded from the shocks triggered by disruptions to food supply as a result of Russia's invasion. ""They are destroying our ports,'' Zelenskyy said. ""The absence of exports from Ukraine will deal a blow to countries worldwide.'' ""The future of Europe rests with your efforts,'' he added.

The latest intelligence report from the UK's Ministry of Defense has warned that Russia will likely continue to ""use its heavy firepower on urban areas as it looks to limit its own already considerable losses."" In over a month of fighting, Russian troops have failed to capture and hold onto any major Ukrainian city, although a number of major centers, including Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol remain under siege. The intelligence report said Russian forces were mainly relying on the indiscriminate use of air and artillery bombardments ""in an attempt to demoralize defending forces,"" rather than large-scale infantry operations inside cities. This strategy would come ""at the cost of further civilian casualties,"" the report added.

The office of Ukraine's prosecutor general says the war in Ukraine has killed 136 children since Russia invaded its neighbor a little over a month ago. The death toll was posted in a message on the Telegram app and on Facebook. It said 64 of those children were killed in the Kyiv region. A further 50 died in the Donetsk region in the country's east, it added. Around 200 children have been injured, the prosecutor's office said. The figures have not been independently verified.

Russia has said its invasion of Ukraine has entered a new phase, one signal it may be scaling back its ambitions. Moscow has suffered a series of setbacks and defeats at the hands of the Ukrainian army and Ukrainians fighting against the Russian invasion. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated his call for peace talks with Russia to end the war, but he stressed that Ukraine would not give up territory. In his nightly video address to the Ukrainian people, Zelenskyy may have been responding to Russian Colonel General Sergei Rudskoi, the deputy chief of the Russian general staff. Rudskoi said Russian forces would focus on ""the main goal, the liberation of Donbas."" Dozens of Ukrainian officials, journalists and activists have been detained or kidnapped by Russian forces, the United Nations has warned. Matilda Bogner, the head of the UN rights team in Ukraine, said human rights monitors have been receiving ever more information on mass graves in the besieged port city of Mariupol. UK intelligence reports Russian forces have been pushed back to 35 kilometers east of Kyiv. The Pentagon said the city of Kherson was again ""contested"" as Ukrainian forces launched a counteroffensive. However, Ukraine's air force said the headquarters in Vinnytsia in the western part of the country was hit by numerous Russian cruise missiles Friday afternoon. Western officials said a seventh Russian general has been killed since the war in Ukraine began. Lt. Gen. Yakov Rezanstev, commander of Russia's 49th Combined Arms Army in the southern military district, was killed most recently.

It is bolstering forces in that area to reflect what Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg calls 'the new normal'.

Direct confrontation between NATO and Russia could touch off a global conflict. One retired NATO commander told Reuters the alliance is considering whether deterrence is enough.

Not according to Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis last week.

He said: ""We are convinced in the Baltic states that we need to move from deterrence to a standing defence and it has to come from NATO planning leadership, that they will start looking into the region differently than they had throughout the last two decades.""

1360,TbWeSO9r3sE,CNBC Television,Authorities search for parents charged in High School shooting in Michigan,2021-12-03T22:18:45Z,25,"Shepard Smith joins 'Closing Bell' to report breaking news on the search for the parents of accused high school shooter Ethan Crumbley in Michigan. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi 

Authorities are searching for the parents of a teenager accused of killing four people in a Michigan high school shooting this week, the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office confirmed Friday.

The news came shortly after Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald announced that James and Jennifer Crumbley had been charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter.

“While the shooter was the one who entered the high school and pulled the trigger, there are other individuals who contributed to the events on Nov. 30, and it’s my intent to hold them accountable as well,” McDonald said at a news conference.

She added, “Gun ownership is a right, and with that right comes great responsibility.”

An attorney for the parents had contacted authorities Friday morning to say that James and Jennifer Crumbley would turn themselves in if they were charged, sheriff Michael Bouchard said.

On Friday afternoon after officials said they were searching for the pair, their lawyers said the couple had not fled but had left town the night after the shooting “for their own safety” and were in the process of returning for arraignment.

“They are not fleeing from law enforcement despite recent comments in media reports,” lawyers Shannon Smith and Mariell Lehman said in a statement.

The attorneys’ statement regarding the Crumbleys’ return was first reported by the Detroit News.

The sheriff’s office said it had not heard from lawyers late Friday afternoon and said that the duo’s voluntary return was not assured.

Earlier in the day Bouchard described resources on the case.

“We have our Fugitive Apprehension Team, the FBI and the U.S. Marshals Service and others actively looking for them and have every expectation we’ll have them in custody soon,” Bouchard said. “The action of fleeing and ignoring their attorney certainly adds weight to the charges. They cannot run from their part in this tragedy.”

The couple may be driving a black 2021 Kia Seltos SUV with a Michigan license plate number, authorities said.

Bouchard said that his department was not given a heads-up from the prosecutor that the charges would be filed against the parents.

“We were informed, actually, by the media that a charging decision had been made,” he told MSNBC.

When asked if that was frustrating, the sheriff responded: “That’s an understatement.”

James Crumbley purchased the weapon days before the shooting, according to the sheriff. McDonald said that James Crumbley brought the suspect, Ethan Crumbley, with him to the store.

Under Michigan law, an involuntary manslaughter charge can be pursued if prosecutors believe someone contributed to a situation in which harm or death was high. If convicted, they could face up to 15 years in prison.

Ethan Crumbley, 15, has been charged as an adult with two dozen crimes, including murder, attempted murder and terrorism, in the shooting Tuesday at Oxford High School in Oakland County, roughly 30 miles north of Detroit.

During Friday’s news conference, the top prosecutor in Oakland County said that a teacher had observed Ethan Crumbley searching ammunition on his cellphone and alerted school officials. The school tried to contact his mother but could not reach her.

McDonald told reporters that Jennifer Crumbley did not contact the school but instead texted her son: “Lol. I’m not mad at you. You have to learn not to get caught.”

On Tuesday, prior to the shooting, another teacher alerted school officials to a drawing found on Ethan Crumbley’s desk. It contained a drawing of a gun pointing at the words “the thoughts won’t stop, help me,” the prosecutor said.

1043,KXj_wuABosQ,The Telegraph,Mobilised Russians 'being sent to the meatgrinder' in 'sick' Soviet tactics | Life on the frontline,2022-10-08T08:00:10Z,25,"Jack Ross is a British volunteer aid worker helping to deliver supplies to the Ukrainian front line. 

He returned to Ukraine from his UK home as soon as news broke of the Ukrainian army's successful Kharkiv offensive. After his last visit in August, his initial plan was to return in November.

Exclusive by Valerie Browne

Donate to Vans Without Borders: https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/p/vans-without-borders---saving-ukrainian-lives

En route, he met up with Nugs, an ex-British military security advisor training Ukrainian troops in advanced tactical warfare.

The military expert compares undertrained mobilised Russian soldiers 'being sent to the meatgrinder' to Soviet battle tactics of World War II.

""They’re pushing Russian troops to the front line and they’ve got a group of others behind them to stop them from retreating. It’s sick,"" Nugs says.

He adds that he's deeply skeptical Russia will resort to nuclear weapons despite their threatening sabre rattling.

""They can say it all they want in terms of the promotion of fear. It won’t happen,"" he said, adding: ""They would be destroyed even before they got anywhere near their target.""

Jack and his team head to the Sumy region 4 km from the Russian front line to give out aid to civilians, many of who are too elderly to evacuate the heavily shelled area.

Sergeant Vadim Shyshimarin, who appeared in court in Kyiv for the first time on Friday, is accused of killing an unarmed Ukrainian civilian.

It's alleged the captured member of a Russian tank unit shot a 62-year-old man in the head through an open car window in the north-eastern village of Chupakhivka during the first days of the war.

He faces up to life in prison under a section of the Ukrainian criminal code that addresses the laws and customs of war.

Shyshimarin's trial, which marks the first war crimes trial since Moscow invaded its neighbour 11 weeks ago, was attended by scores of journalists at the Solomyanskyy district court in Kyiv and will be watched closely by the world.

""Multiple supporters of President Donald Trump over the past couple of weeks have taken to Twitter to air their grievances about the president’s signature tax cut plan.

Even though the 2017 GOP tax cut is leading to spiking federal deficits thanks to its generous benefits to corporations, many middle-class Americans are winding up having to pay more because the bill eliminated multiple deductions used by middle-class families to lower their annual tax payments.

Among other things, the tax bill capped deductions for taxes paid to state and local governments, while massively increasing the amount of money you must donate to qualify for a charitable giving deduction.""

1199,SscQBrJbiN0,The Economist,What does China want?,2014-08-27T14:23:40Z,25,"An animated infographic depicting China’s territorial disputes. Is China trying to expand its territory?

Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.trib.al/rWl91R7 

ONE reason China’s spectacular rise sometimes alarms its neighbours is that it is not a status quo power. From its inland, western borders to its eastern and southern seaboard, it claims territory it does not control.

In the west, China’s border dispute with India is more than a minor cartographic tiff.  China claims an area of India that is three times the size of Switzerland, the state of Arunachal Pradesh.

Further west, China occupies Indian claimed territory next to Ladakh in Kashmir, an area called the Aksai Chin. China humiliated India in a brief, bloody war over the dispute in 1962. Since 1988, the two countries have put the dispute on the backburner and got on with developing commercial ties, despite occasional flare-ups.

More immediately dangerous is the stand-off between China and Japan over disputed islands in the East China Sea, known as the Senkakus in Japan and Diaoyu in Chinese. 

Japan says they have always been its territory and admits no dispute, claiming also that China only started expressing an interest when it began to seem the area might be rich in oil and gas. 

A new and much more dangerous phase of the dispute began in 2012 after Japan’s government nationalised three of the islands by buying them from their private owner.

China accused Japan of breaking an understanding not to change the islands’ status. Ever since, it has been challenging not just Japan’s claim to sovereignty over the islands, but its claim to control them, sending Chinese ships and planes to patrol them.

Raising the stakes is Japan’s alliance with America, which says that though it takes no position on who owns the islands, they are covered by its defence treaty with Japan, since it administers them.

Especially provocative to America and Japan was China’s unilateral announcement in November 2013 of an Air-defence Identification Zone, covering the islands. 

The worry is less that big powers will deliberately go to war over these desolate little rocks, but that an accidental collision at sea or in the air might escalate unforeseeably.

Similar fears cloud disputes in the South China Sea, where the maritime claims in South-East Asia are even more complex, and, again, competition is made more intense by speculation about vast potential wealth in hydrocarbon resources.

Vietnam was incensed in May 2014 when China moved a massive oil-rig to drill for two months in what it claimed as its waters.

This was near the Paracel Islands, controlled by China since it evicted the former South Vietnamese from them in 1974.

To the south, China and Vietnam also claim the Spratly archipelago, as does Taiwan, whose claim in the sea mirrors China’s. But the Philippines also has a substantial claim. Malaysia and even tiny Brunei also have an interest. 

But it is with Vietnam and the Philippines that China’s disputes are most active. The Philippines accuses China of salami-slicing tactics, stealthily expanding its presence in disputed waters. In 1995 it evicted the Philippines from Mischief Reef, and in 2012 from Scarborough Shoal.

This year it has tried to stop the Philippines from resupplying a small garrison it maintains on the Second Thomas Shoal, and appears to be building an airstrip on the Johnson South Reef.

The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea—UNCLOS—is one forum for tackling these disputes. But UNCLOS cannot rule over territorial disputes, just over the waters habitable islands are entitled to.

And China and Taiwan point to a map published in the 1940s, showing a big U-shaped nine-dashed line around the edge of the sea. That, they say, is historically all China’s. This has no basis in international law, and the Philippines, to China’s fury, is challenging it at an UNCLOS tribunal. 

In fact China often fails to clarify whether its claims are based on the nine-dashed line, or on claims to islands, rocks and shoals.

That lack of clarity alarms not just its neighbours and rival claimants, but the United States, which says it has its own national interest in the freedom of navigation in a sea through which a huge chunk of global trade passes

Also alarming is that if these arguments over tiny specks in the sea become so unmanageable, what hope is there for resolving the really big issues? And the biggest of all is the status of Taiwan, still seen by China as part of its territory, but in practice independent since 1949.

For now, Taiwan and China have a thriving commercial relationship. But polls suggest that few in Taiwan hanker after unification with the mainland. And China’s rulers still insist that one day they will have to accept just that.",1232990.0,6765,3249.0,PT4M7S

281,asGHu2NzvbI,Al Jazeera English,Islamophobia in Europe: Why won't Poland take in any Muslims? | UpFront,2019-11-08T11:52:18Z,25,"In this episode of UpFront, we ask Polish politician Dominik Tarczynski about his government's immigration policy and anti-Muslim rhetoric.

And in our Arena, Rim-Sarah Alouane and Benjamin Haddad discuss what's behind the ongoing debate over secularism in France.

Polish MP: 'For me, multiculturalism is not a value'
Poland's ultra-conservative Law and Justice Party (PiS) won a second term in office last month, a victory that critics fear will accelerate the country's slide towards authoritarianism.

The PiS rose to power in 2015, following a campaign that focussed on social conservatism, along with a generous social spending programme.

But the party's refusal to take in refugees, along with its attempts to reform the judiciary - critics say at the expense of independence - has put it at loggerheads with the European Union.

Just this week a top EU legal adviser said Warsaw broke the bloc’s law by refusing to take in refugees during Europe's 2015 migrant crisis.

But the PiS's Domink Tarczynski insists his country did nothing wrong, and says Poland stands by its immigration policy.

""We don't want Poland being taken over by Muslims, Buddhists, or someone else ... and no one will ever force us to take Muslims, Buddhists, non-believers in huge numbers,"" said Tarczynski.

Tarczynski says after living in the UK and the US and experiencing life in a multicultural society, he doesn't see any value in it.

""For me, multicultural society, it's not a value … it's not a virtue,"" the Polish MP said. ""Christian culture, Roman law, Greek philosophers, these are the virtues for us.""

This week's Headliner is member of parliament for Poland's governing Law and Justice Party, Dominik Tarczynski.

France, secularism and hijab paranoia
The debate over Muslim women wearing the veil has been reignited in France, after a mother was verbally abused last month by a far-right politican during her son's school trip to a regional assembly. The politician demanded the woman remove her headscarf or leave.

Wearing the veil - known as the hijab - is banned in French schools and government offices.

Politicians are now examining a proposed law that would ban parents from wearing religious symbols by parents on school trips.

The legislation has little chance of passing, but it has put the issue of French secularism, embodied in the principle of 'laicite', firmly back in the spotlight.

Critics see a worrying trend where 'laicite' could enter more areas of French society.

""We are witnessing a transformation of 'laicite' into a legal monster that it was not aimed to be when the law was implemented,"" said human rights researcher Rim-Sarah Alouane, who focuses on religious freedom and civil liberties.

""We have religious freedom at stake, but also constant harassment and targeting of a part of our population,"" she added.

Benjamin Haddad, a director at the Atlantic Council, says the law does target Muslims, and agrees it should not be extended, but he says it should be acceptable to have a political debate about what some see as problems with integration.

""You have a lot of secular Muslim women who say that they feel pressured, they feel threatened ... you also have religious leaders going to mayors asking to have separate hours in public swimming pools between men and women. You'll have a lot of young girls who don't want to sit in biology classes in school because they feel pressure from their parents or from their brothers,"" Haddad said.

""That makes it very complicated for young women and other groups such as LGBTs to express themselves,"" he added.

In this week's Arena, we discuss secularism in France and its impact on religious freedom.

889,r5YOqIK7Bkk,PBS NewsHour,WATCH: Democratic counsel’s questioning of committee lawyers | Trump's first impeachment,2019-12-09T19:13:13Z,25,"Barry Berke, the House Democratic counsel, questioned Republican counsel Stephen Castor and fellow Democratic counsel Daniel Goldman on Dec. 9. The questioning came on the second day of public hearings by the House Judiciary Committee as part of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. Berke asked a question that both Castor and Goldman appeared to agree on. “Is it your experience, that when someone has done something wrongful and corrupt, and they’re dealing with somebody who’s not in the scheme, that they state their intentions to do something wrongful and corrupt?” Berke asked. Castor said no, in a general sense. In answering Berke’s question, Goldman said, “You almost never have a defendant ... who would ever explicitly say … 'I’m going to bribe you now. I’m going to ask you for a bribe. I’m going to extort you.' That’s not how things work.” The Judiciary and Intelligence committees have led the probe, hearing testimony from witnesses and legal experts about Trump’s conduct. House lawmakers are currently drafting the articles of impeachment, on which House lawmakers are anticipated to vote in the coming weeks. The impeachment case has revolved around a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked the president of Ukraine to investigate former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

Talking on Russian TV to employees of Russian airline Aeroflot, Putin said that if countries wanted to impose no-fly zones, they should do so over their own territory and not over Ukraine.

""Any movement in this direction will be considered by us as participation in an armed conflict by that country,"" he said.

Ukrainians have been asking NATO to impose a no-fly zone but NATO leaders, wary of a potential clash with the Russian air force, have steered away from it.

It was supposed to be the first one-person-one-vote election in 50 years. However, in September, that plan was abandoned and replaced with indirect elections for Parliament in December and for the president on February 8. Neither happened.

Now, the official time in office of President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo has come on an end. And without political agreement, opposition leaders have declared Farmaajo’s government illegitimate.

So, what is next for Somalia? Will the government remain in office? Or will there be a power vacuum? Somalia’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohamed Abdirizak talks to Al Jazeera.

In the world of US President Donald Trump, it has come to mean the civil servants who have been working for the government for years.

They are ""holdovers"" from previous administrations, and they are blocking his agenda and policy reversals. At least, that's the mantra that he repeats in his campaign rallies nationwide.

But is Trump using this construct as a punching bag to paint himself as an underdog who is fighting the powers that be?

""Deep state"" has become a permanent fixture of the culture wars in the United States, and Trump is using it to energise his base.

So what is the reality of the ""deep state"" in US politics? Join Steve Clemons as he hosts a discussion on the ramifications of the constant presidential rants against government bureaucrats and diplomats.

Western leaders acknowledged that their withdrawal would mean leaving behind some of their citizens and many locals who helped them over the years, and they promised to try to continue working with the Taliban to allow local allies to leave after President Joe Biden’s Tuesday’s deadline to withdraw from the country.

In World news and current events today, world leaders from around the globe have condemned President Donald Trump and his response to the peaceful protest happening in front of the White House as a result of the police killing of George Floyd. 

The senseless act has sparked a movement of George Floyd protests and Black Lives Matter protests not just in America, but around the world, but no other leader has responded to the uprising with the same violent rhetoric as President Trump. From Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson of England, international leaders from Germany to the entire European Union have roundly condemned the violent response of Donald J. Trump and voiced support for Black Lives Matter, the BLM protests, and the fight for racial justice.

996,rnfCM3R7w04,The Sun,Ukraine braces for Russian 'battles ahead' after Zelensky 'fires two traitor generals',2022-04-01T10:55:22Z,25,"Ukraine is bracing for new attacks from Russia with leader Volodymyr Zelensky warning late Thursday of 'battles ahead.'

He said the situation in the south and southwestern Donbas region remained 'extremely difficult', and also said again that Russia was building up forces near the besieged port city of Mariupol.

""Also, in the Donbas, in Mariupol, in the Kharkiv direction, the Russian troops are accumulating the potential for strikes - powerful strikes. We will defend ourselves. We will do everything we can to stop the occupiers and cleanse our land of their evil and senseless chimeras.”

And in a rare sign of internal dissent, Zelensky also announced he was firing two generals on the grounds they were traitors.

""Those high-ranking servicemen, who have been prevented from deciding where their homeland is, who break the military oath of allegiance to the Ukrainian people for the protection of our state, its freedom and independence, will inevitably be deprived of high military ranks.""

Earlier on Thursday a Russian missile strike in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv hit gas pipes, cutting off supplies to tens of thousands of people there.

Kharkiv, the country's second largest city, has suffered some of the heaviest shelling since Russia invaded Ukraine more than a month ago.

Zelenskiy however said his forces had pushed back the Russian military from the capital Kyiv and the nearby city of Chernihiv.

At talks this week, Moscow said it would reduce offensives in both cities as a goodwill gesture and focus on what it called 'liberating' Donbas.

After weeks of constant shelling, the city of Mariupol has no running water, gas or electricity - another obstacle for those who remain as they fight to survive.

A spokesperson for Mariupol's mayor said on Monday nearly 5000 people had already been killed.

Ukrainian authorities were hoping to evacuate more residents from Mariupol after Russia agreed to open a humanitarian corridor on Friday, but several previous deals have collapsed.

Russia says it is carrying out a 'special operation' to disarm and 'denazify' its neighbour.

But it denies Kyiv's accusations that they are targeting civilians.

Western countries say Putin's real aim was to topple Ukraine's government.

Peace negotiations are set to resume by video conference on Friday.

Today, officials in the southern city of Mariupol said that as many as 300 people were killed when the theatre they were sheltering in was hit on 16 March.

Moscow signalled that it is scaling back its military ambitions in Ukraine to focus on the Donbass region, territory claimed by Russian-backed separatists.

Lying on the edge of that region, the strategically important city of Izyum has seen intense fighting. With officials there telling us Russians have taken control of land north of the river.

290,DIkfF62vzPI,Al Jazeera English,How Sheriffs created the most powerful ‘gangs’ In Los Angeles | Fault Lines Documentary,2022-05-11T12:02:47Z,25,"Los Angeles, in the US state of California, has been plagued with gang violence for decades, and has even been called the “gang capital of America"".

But they’re not just on the streets.

Reports and lawsuits allege that there are deputy ""gangs"" within the LA County Sheriff’s Department.

Members have unique tattoos identifying which station they belong to and are accused of using excessive force, and glorifying an aggressive form of policing.

Fault Lines investigates the shooting death of 21-year-old Anthony Vargas. His family believes that the sheriffs’ deputies who killed him were prospective members of the Banditos — a gang inside the East LA station, which has one of the highest rates of deputy-involved shootings in the county.

""Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado told Fox News on Wednesday she intended to take legal action against the political action committee widely credited with making Madison Cawthorn the youngest member of Congress to lose a primary.

Following Cawthorn's defeat in May, the American Muckrakers PAC announced they were targeting Boebert, who is also a first-term Republican.

On Tuesday, the PAC published salacious allegations about Boebert working through a ""sugar daddy"" website prior to her election to Congress.

The group said ""their team and volunteers have uncovered that Lauren Boebert was an unlicensed, paid escort and met clients through SugarDaddyMeet.com. Text messages show she was bankrupt at the time and looking for some 'side income' and called her work 'pay to play.' She was paid to 'escort' with wealthy men,"" the group alleged.""

891,DJtRtWu7gcE,PBS NewsHour,WATCH: Former Justice Department official said Trump asked him to call 2020 election ‘corrupt’,2022-06-23T20:58:00Z,25,"Former acting deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue spoke on June 23 as the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack presented its findings in their fifth public hearing.
Donaghue went through the steps the Department of Justice took to investigate claims of fraud that former President Donald Trump had repetitively raised. They said they found none of the claims to be factual.

“We went through a series of other [claims that the president raised]. The truck driver who claim to have moved an entire tractor trailer of ballots from New York to Pennsylvania. That was also incorrect. We did an investigation with the FBI, interviewed witnesses at the front end and the back end of that trailer’s transit from New York to Pennsylvania. We looked at loading manifests. We interviewed witnesses, including, of course, the driver, and we knew it wasn't true. Whether the driver believed or not was never clear to me, but it was just not true,” he said.

Donaghue began taking handwritten notes on a call with the president when he made an allegation that was new to him-- that more than 200,000 votes were certified in Pennsylvania that were not actually cast. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill. showed Donoghue’s notes at the hearing which quoted the president directly from the call the two had.

“The president said, ‘just say the election was corrupt. And leave the rest of me and the Republican congressman,’” Kinzinger said. “That’s a direct quote from President Trump?”
“Correct, “ Donaghue said. “That's an exact quote from President. Yes.”

Kinzinger also played video testimony from former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani where Giuliani was asked about whether obscure DOJ official Jeffrey Clark was recommended to be put in a leadership position of the department after Clark had pushed proposals to further the president's effort to overturn the 2020 election.

“I do recall saying to people that somebody should be put in charge of the Justice Department who isn't frightened of what's going to be done to their reputation. Because the Justice Department was filled with people like that,” Giuliani said in a video testimony.

The hearing, the fifth of several planned by the Jan. 6 committee, focused on Trump’s pressure on the Department of Justice to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. In the year since its creation, the committee has conducted more than 1,000 interviews, seeking critical information and documents from people witness to, or involved in, the violence that day.

Bayer took it to market shortly thereafter, and it is currently an approved treatment for late-stage kidney and liver cancer.

That is, so long as you live in the developed world. In a recently published interview in Bloomberg Businessweek, Bayer CEO Marijn Dekkers said that his company's drug isn't for poor people.

""We did not develop this medicine for Indians...we developed it for western patients who can afford it,"" he said back in December. The quote is quickly making its way across Indian news outlets.

The comment was in response to a decision by an Indian patent court that granted a compulsory license to a local company to reproduce Bayer's drug.""* The Young Turks hosts Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian break it down.

READ MORE: U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin have ended their summit in Geneva, chosen as a location for the talks for its history of political neutrality.     

According to a White House official, the summit ended at 5.05 pm CEST Wednesday when the P+5 expanded bilateral between the two delegations concluded. The session was concluded after one bilateral meeting, according to the official, not two as was previously scheduled. 

Biden and Putin are scheduled to hold separate, solo news conferences later Wednesday. 

Before their meetings, the leaders thanked each other during the brief, and chaotic press opportunity at the beginning of their meeting where American and Russian media jostled each other. 

“Mr. President, I’d like to thank you for your initiative to meet today. I know that you’ve been on a long journey,” said Putin via an interpreter. “The U.S. and Russian relations have a lot of issues accumulated that require the highest-level meeting. And I hope that our meeting will be productive,” he added. 

Biden responded in kind. “Thank you,” Biden said. “As I said outside, I think it’s always better to meet face to face.”

Brave NHS workers Deena Evans, 40, and Michael Hipgrave, 52, were knifed and left with gaping wounds while on duty in Wolverhampton, West Mids, in July last year.

Mum-of-three Deena was stabbed once in the chest and fellow medic dad Michael was slashed across his back by 52-year-old Martyn Smith.

He was today locked up for nine years at Wolverhampton Crown Court after admitting two counts of wounding with intent.

The court heard how Mick and Deena were attacked by jobless Smith with two large kitchen knives.

Neighbours said they heard ""blood curdling screams"" and the ambulance workers shouting ""please help, he's got a knife"" during the terrifying incident.

Graphic images of the wounds were released, along with stills from police body-worn video footage, showing Ms Evans lying on the grass, with an injured Mr Hipgrave.

In a victim impact statement read in court, Deena told how she relives the attack every time she shuts her eyes.

Speaking out about the brutal attack, she told Smith: “Your sentence will not give me back the year I lost, neither will it take away my painful and ugly scar, or the mental stress you caused.

""CNN’s Alisyn Camerota moderated a Donald Trump voter focus group on Tuesday, and the discussion became a free-for-all when the president’s supporters sparred with those who have come to regret backing him in 2016.

The panel was an even split of backers and critics, and Arthur Schaper started things off by lauding Trump’s performance in office so far. These plaudits were countered by Jeremy Montanez, who called Trump a bigoted “monster” while slamming the White House’s separation of migrant families at the southern border.

The panel ended up holding a conversation about illegal immigration and migrant parents who had their children taken away even though they tried crossing the border through the proper legal channels. This segued into a debate about whether Trump is responsible for the increasing levels of divisiveness around the country.”*

(Subscribe: https://bit.ly/C4_News_Subscribe) 

From the start of the Conservative leadership campaign, Rishi Sunak has sought to downplay his vast wealth and privilege to tell a story of middle class aspiration, seeking to demonstrate he understands the financial challenge faced by ordinary citizens. 

But tonight an investigation for this programme has uncovered new details about Mr Sunak's education, property and financial dealings - and raises new questions about whether his hedge fund paid him with assets in offshore tax havens.

Actor Paul Walker has died in a car crash in Southern California. His death has left his fan base across the world in shock.  

The star of the 'Fast and Furious' movies was a passenger in the red Porsche which burst into flames when it crashed. He and the driver were pronounced dead at the scene.

Tributes have poured in to the 40- year-old who had been attending a charity event for his organisation ""Reach Out Worldwide.""

""Everybody was saying he had died and I thought it was a hoax and because of the way he died and being in the 'Fast and Furious films' I thought 'no way'. He was one of the celebrities using his fame for good reason,"" said one fan. 

At the scene and across the world he will be remembered as a star and for the work of ""Reach Out Worldwide"" which helped victims of natural disasters around the globe.

Walker, who began his acting career a child in commercials, starred in all but one of the six multi-million dollar ""Fast and Furious"" hit movies in which he played Brian O'Connor, a law enforcement agent.

998,bHo3EvlOBmU,The Sun,Furious row after toddler ‘hit and dragged by cyclist’,2020-09-10T13:58:51Z,25,"A one-year-old girl was left with scratches on her face after she was hit and dragged along the ground by a cyclist who allegedly tried to flee the scene.

Freya Clancy, who is just 16 months old, was walking on a pedestrian path in Victoria Park, East London, when a cyclist travelling at “around 10mph hit her head on”.

Her arm then got caught in the spokes and the toddler was dragged along the ground until the cyclist slammed on her brakes at around 9am yesterday.

The girl’s stunned mum, Victoria Grant, told The Sun Online: “The cyclist came flying out of the gate and her front wheel hit my daughter in the face.

“It was awful. I was screaming and shouting ‘you have just run over my daughter’.”

Video footage taken at the scene shows the irate woman arguing with a local and Victoria claims she did not apologise or ask how her daughter was.

Footage also shows the woman speaking to an off-duty police officer in the park.

She told him: ""The kid comes into the middle of my path, I don't even see the kid.

""They're all ganging up on me. The kid runs right in front of my path.""

Freya was then rushed to Royal London Hospital where she had an x-ray on her arm, but luckily nothing was broken.

Victoria, 33, has now been told to moisturise her face to prevent the scratches from leaving a scar.

The mum-of-three is now trying to track the cyclist down after she claims the woman wouldn't pass on her details.

1363,Wq33oZdQ-R4,CNBC Television,'We're basically at a pandemic now': Mayo Clinic physician on coronavirus,2020-02-03T13:39:48Z,25,"Dr. Gregory Poland, professor of medicine and infectious diseases and the director of the Vaccine Research Group at Mayo Clinic, and Dr. Scott Gottlieb, Pfizer board member and former FDA Commissioner, join ""Squawk Box"" to discuss the spread of misinformation on the coronavirus.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned on Monday that the world may be “dangerously” unprepared for the next pandemic as the flu-like coronavirus that emerged from China about a month ago spreads rapidly to new countries.

At an executive board meeting in Geneva, Tedros urged the World Health Organization’s 196 member countries to “invest in preparedness,” not “panic.” He added that funding for outbreak preparedness in surrounding countries “has remained grossly inadequate” in the past.

“For too long, the world has operated on a cycle of panic and neglect,” Tedros said, according to a transcript of his remarks. “We throw money at an outbreak, and when it’s over, we forget about it and do nothing to prevent the next one.”

“If we fail to prepare, we are preparing to fail,” he added.

Tedros said more than $1 billion has been spent trying to stop the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. By comparison, he added, just $18 million was spent on preparedness in Congo’s neighbor Uganda before the virus crossed the border.

“This must be a lesson for the rest of the world,” he said.

The plea from WHO’s top official comes as the deadly coronavirus has now killed at least 362 people and sickened more than 17,400 worldwide, including patients in the U.S. and Europe.

The respiratory illness, which is capable of spreading through human-to-human contact, is not yet considered a pandemic. A pandemic is “an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people,” according to WHO. While the new virus has spread to almost two dozen countries, the majority of the cases remain in mainland China.

Nevertheless, many global health experts expect the virus will become a pandemic. Since emerging about a month ago in Wuhan, China, the coronavirus has infected more people than the 2003 SARS epidemic, which sickened roughly 8,100 people across the globe over nine months. As of Monday, there are nearly 200 cases in at least 23 countries, outside of China, a handful of which have been transmitted from human contact within those countries.

On Thursday, WHO declared the virus a global health emergency after declining to do so at two previous meetings.

Tedros said the “continued increase in cases and the evidence of human-to-human transmission outside of China” were “most deeply disturbing.”

""Fox News’ Eric Shawn devoted a segment on Sunday afternoon debunking a number of claims made by President Donald Trump and his allies about a “rigged” election.

Shawn told viewers, “Rigged election? Well, your own government, election officials across the country, and voting experts say T not true. It’s not true. Baseless claims that are inflammatory, designed to undermine your faith in American democracy.”

He showed video from U.S. election security official Ben Hovland saying, “The reality is this was the most secure election we’ve ever had, and it was one of the most well-run elections we’ve ever had… And this is about facts, this is about truth, this is about respecting our democracy.”*

Northwest of Kyiv, the towns of Irpin and Bootcha were early hot spots in the war.

In the south of the country, official efforts to evacuate people from the besieged city of Mariupol remain stalled. 

Nearby in Enerhodar, Ukrainians protesting the Russian occupation today were met with shots and stun grenades.

897,fuP1Bqsqk9w,PBS NewsHour,WATCH: Rep. Liz Cheney says Trump ignored pleas to stop Jan. 6 violence | Jan. 6 hearings,2022-06-10T01:37:02Z,25,"Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming said in her opening remarks of the first Jan. 6 committee hearing June 9 that former President Donald Trump's intention as the violence unfolded ""was to remain president of the United States, despite the lawful outcome of the 2020 election.""

The hearing June 9 was the first of several planned by the Jan. 6 committee in the coming weeks. In the year since its creation, the committee has conducted more than 1,000 interviews, seeking critical information and documents from people witness to, or involved in, the violence that day.

Cheney added that the committee learned that Trump ""oversaw and coordinated"" a seven-part plan to overturn the presidential election despite advisors being aware Trump had lost. Despite that, Cheney said, the president embarked on a campaign to spread the lie that the election had been stolen.

""Over a series of hearings in the coming weeks, you will hear testimony, live on video, from more than half a dozen former white house staff in the trump administration. All of whom were in the west wing of the white house on January 6th. You will hear testimony that 'The president did not really want to put anything out, calling off the riot or asking his supporters to leave.' You will hear President Trump was yelling and 'really angry' at advisers who told him he needed to be doing something more. And aware of the rioters chants to 'hang Mike Pence,' the president responded with this sentiment: 'Maybe our supporters have the right idea, Mike Pence deserves it.'""

297,_aSLhz00U7s,Al Jazeera English,Japan: The Age Of Social Withdrawal | 101 East,2020-03-20T06:21:54Z,25,"Kenji Yamase spends his days in his bedroom.

The 54-year-old has been a ""hikikomori"" all of his adult life. The term describes Japanese who rarely interact with society beyond their family.

""It's a sense or feeling that you shouldn't be here. Even if you are here, you feel like you aren't yourself,"" Kenji says.

Japan is home to more than one million hikikomori, according to recent government surveys. Many of them are over the age of 40 and rely heavily on their elderly parents.

Kenji lives with his 88-year-old mother. ""Year by year, I can feel that she's deteriorating ... I worry about her, but I don't know what to do, so I feel very bad,"" he says. ""I feel sad thinking about when she's gone.""

An increasing number of school students are also choosing to shun the outside world. Known as ""futoko"", these children blame a rigid education system, bullying and strict parenting for their social withdrawal. It has led to NGOs setting up education centres across the country as an alternative to Japan's strict schools.

Umi Maekita, who runs Nemonet Free School, says most children who attend these centres eventually return to the mainstream education system. He says early intervention can prevent a lifetime of isolation.

""Telling them to go back to work or go back to school straight away is not the way,"" he says.

101 East meets the young and old who feel lost in Japan.

But Low Taek Jho, or Jho Low, as he is known, has so far managed to elude Malaysian and international law enforcement agencies - somehow staying out of the public eye and keeping one step ahead of Interpol red notices for his arrest.

Yet, as this exclusive Al Jazeera investigation reveals, even while on the run, Jho Low has been attempting to negotiate yet another behind-the-scenes deal - this time to stay out of jail.

With new information on the role played by Jho Low and his associates in the 1MDB scandal, and previously unheard recordings of the man himself, this eye-opening film sheds new light on what has been dubbed ""the world's biggest heist"".

Johnson told lawmakers that the restrictions were being eased because of the ""extraordinary booster campaign"" as well as because government scientists believed it was likely that the surge of Omicron infections “has now peaked nationally.""

“We will trust the judgment of the British people and no longer criminalize anyone who chooses not to wear one,” Johnson said on masks.

The government will no longer advise people to work from home and beginning next Thursday, mandatory COVID-19 passes will not be required to gain entry to large-scale events.

Londoners shared mixed views about the easing of restrictions.

http://www.euronews.com/2013/12/04/regulate-or-root-out-prostitution-the-oldest-profession-in-the-world
It is often called the oldest profession in the world - prostitution. Should it be banned or regulated like other businesses?  In Europe there are a few countries where it is forbidden, such as Finland and Romania but without penalising those who use the services of a prostitute.

For it is the clients and not the prostitutes who are the core of the business.

""You have to cut off evil at the root. Prostitution flourishes and is maintained by customers and the only way to hit the business is with a change of outlook and that is to punish the root of it, the client,"" opined Rosen Richer, a former prostitute

There are five countries in Europe which impose punishments. Sweden, Norway, Iceland, the United Kingdom but only if the person is forced into prostitution - human trafficking is an example of that. Slovakia has penalties of up to ten years in prison. 

Since 1999 Sweden has been at the forefront of curbing prostitution, punishing paying for sex with imprisonment of at least six months and with fines imposed in proportion to the person's income.

It has proved an effective weapon, say the police, in the fight against human trafficking.

""Things have definitely changed because all the customers that come here know that there's the risk that there are some police officers sitting somewhere,"" said Per Hjort who is a police inspector in Sweden. 

The result is that almost 5,000 men have often just been detained for questioning and not imprisoned. The fear is the law has driven customers to go online where sex is on offer.

In contrast, five countries have regulated prostitution. Denmark since 1999 while the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and Greece also regulate it.

In Switzerland prostitution is considered a fully fledged economic activity and permitted from the age of 16.

In Zurich a drive-in-for-sex has just opened in a bid to better-regulate the business. It is run by the city authorities.

""In the last few years the problem has increased and in particular when we saw Romanians being forced into it. The situation deteriorated and so we had to find a solution,"" said Michael Hertzig of the Social Services Department.

The panel detailed former President Donald Trump’s pressure on the Justice Department to overturn the 2020 election results. In the last two weeks, the committee has outlined how Trump and his allies pushed false claims of election fraud leading up to Jan. 6, 2021. Trump then encouraged his supporters to descend on the Capitol to stop former Vice President Mike Pence from certifying the Electoral College votes. Tuesday’s hearing focused on the threats made to state lawmakers, election officials and workers in Arizona and Georgia. Former election worker Shaye Moss testified that she and her family were threatened “all because of lies” about the election being stolen.

House managers have argued that the attack was “predictable” and “foreseeable” because of the former president’s provocations, including tweets and speeches that were displayed as part of their presentation. Unseen security footage presented by managers also showed the following:

- Vice President Pence and his family being rushed from the Senate chamber
- Rioters chanting and searching for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)
- Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) running in the opposite direction of the rioters

The Post’s Libby Casey will anchor live coverage of the trial and be joined by reporters Rhonda Colvin, Joyce Koh, Nicole Ellis, Hannah Jewell and James Hohmann. Read more: https://wapo.st/3rK6XGC. Subscribe to The Washington Post on YouTube: https://wapo.st/2QOdcqK

""President Trump’s two sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, who were born into wealth and work at a company their grandfather founded, have spent the last few weeks contending for the title of World’s Least Self-Aware Person.

First, one of them goes on TV or Twitter and attacks Hunter Biden for trading on his father’s name, brushing aside their own histories of doing the same. Then the other one goes on TV or Twitter and wags their finger at Joe Biden allowing his son to profit off his name, never mentioning that their sister and brother-in-law are senior White House officials whose companies are raking in cash as they help craft U.S. policy. With each appearance, the irony and sanctimony are ratcheted up.

The brotherly competition reached its apex Wednesday night when Don Jr., who became an executive vice-president at his father’s company at the age of 23, appeared on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show and said this: “When you’re the father and your son’s entire career is dependent on that, they own you.”*

The vote came exactly one week after a mob of the president's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol building in an effort to block Congress from counting the Electoral College votes and confirming President-elect Joe Biden's victory.

The vote was 232 in favor, 197 opposed. Ten Republicans joined 222 Democrats in voting to impeach.

The article of impeachment, introduced Monday by House Democrats, accuses Mr. Trump of ""willfully inciting violence against the government of the United States"" in violation of his constitutional oath and duty.

We assembled a panel of experts to debate this and give us their ideas on the future of their industries.

The technology sector is facing sharper scrutiny after a former Facebook employee turned whistleblower accused the company of knowingly choosing profits over public safety, providing thousands of internal documents to support the claims.

As calls for more regulation intensify, citizens, policy-makers and innovators are wondering: how can we ensure technology serves the public good without stifling innovation? Can innovation be both profitable and take into account the public good?

Euronews assembled a panel of experts to address these questions during a live debate and to give their thoughts on how innovation can benefit everyone.

Earlier Sunday, President Donald Trump granted that request by declaring that a ""major disaster"" exists in California. He ordered federal funding to be made available to help fight wildfires that are ravaging communities up and down the drought-stricken West Coast state.

517,TVdD4wRKnaI,The Young Turks,Marijuana Study Reports Positive And Negative Findings,2014-10-12T00:00:00Z,25,"""On Monday, the scientific journal Addiction released a sweeping new review of 20 years of research into the recreational use of marijuana. Dr. Wayne Hall, director of the Centre for Youth Substance Abuse Research at the University of Queensland and an adviser to the World Health Organization, began the review in 1993. At that time, there were “very few epidemiological studies of the health effects of cannabis,” he says. The existing scientific literature was “dominated” by “animal studies from the 1970s,” and the only human laboratory studies available were from the late ’70s and early ’80s. And even those analyzed only “the effects of sustained cannabis use over 7–35 days on the health of college students.”

What changed to make a review like this possible? Two things: First, people are smoking more weed. “During the past half-century,” the authors say, “recreational cannabis use has become almost as common as tobacco use among adolescents and young adults,” which means there are simply more weed smokers to study.” *

Cenk Uygur (http://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur) and Ana Kasparian (http://www.twitter.com/AnaKasparian) break it down on The Young Turks.

As Abigail Bimman reports, while Trudeau said Canadians' efforts are helping to curb the spread, more still needs to be done. 

Meanwhile, Jennifer Johnson reports on the staggering statistics that reveal one person is dying every 17 minutes in New York, as the U.S. scrambles to source medical supplies to slow the spread of the pandemic.

Europe has passed two grim COVID-19 milestones, after the continent reported twenty thousand deaths linked to the virus, half of which occurred in Italy. As Redmond Shannon explains, while several countries have already imposed lockdowns, these measures are expected to become even more severe. 

The Bank of Canada dropped its key lending rate in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a nationwide drop in mortgage rates. As Robin Gill reports, the pandemic is forcing realtors to adapt to cooling sales in recently hot markets. 

As the world responds to the COVID-19 pandemic, people around the world are adjusting to the strict social distancing measures imposed, including self-isolation. Reggie Cecchini looks at how people are passing the time.

Since September, the emergency has killed at least 10, destroyed more than 700 homes and scorched millions of hectares. Morrison is back in Australia, where his leadership is under scrutiny.
 
Thirteen-year-old Izzy Raj-Seppings, an Australian schoolgirl, joined hundreds of protesters, including her father, demanding that Morrison take the threat of global warming more seriously.
 
They argue that a drier warmer climate is increasing Australia's vulnerability to bush fires.

Raj-Seppings was told she could be arrested outside Morrison's official residence in Sydney
  
As the fires raged across the country, Morrison was on vacation in the United States. He was criticized for leaving the country during a crisis. He has apologized but is defending his government's climate policies.

The girl begged her new husband and in-laws to allow her to return to school, “but they wouldn’t let me.” Instead, she says, they cursed and beat her. Finally, after months of struggle, she obtained a divorce. Now living with her mother and brother, Somaya has found comfort in their company and pride in her work as a seamstress.

Voice of America reporters around the world focused on the worth of a girl to reveal how a young bride is valued by two families: the one she leaves behind and the one she joins. Explore the full project https://projects.voanews.com/child-marriage/",853622.0,6886,1530,PT3M44S

1297,ZbFaEIufr5s,Voice of America,Zelenskyy Thanks Partners for ‘Finally’ Providing the Weapons Ukraine Needs,2022-04-23T03:57:18Z,25,"Russia’s deputy military commander said Moscow's goal is to control Donbas and southern Ukraine, which would give Russia access the separatist Moldovan enclave of Transnistria and block Kyiv’s access to the Black Sea. But U.S. officials vow to help Ukraine defend itself, as VOA’s Senior Diplomatic Correspondent Cindy Saine reports.

As Russia’s assault on Ukraine continues in the city of Kharkiv, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed Ukraine Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal to the State Department Friday. Blinken again expressed confidence that Ukraine will prevail in the war.

Antony Blinken, Secretary of State:

""I think this is the first visit since the Russian aggression by a senior official of the Ukrainian government, further evidence that an independent, sovereign Ukraine is going to be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin.”

Both Prime Minister Shmyhal and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the U.S. and other Western partners for “finally” providing the weapons Ukraine needs to fight back against Russia’s offensive in Donbas and southern Ukraine.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukrainian President:

“And I am grateful to all our partners who finally heard us, who are providing us with exactly what we asked for. Because we know for sure that with these weapons, we will be able to save the lives of thousands of people.""

At the Pentagon, press secretary John Kirby was asked whether Ukraine's forces, now that they're getting heavy weapons, would be able to beat back the invading Russians.

John Kirby, Pentagon Press Secretary

“I think that's a question that only the Ukrainian armed forces can answer, not the United States military. What I can tell you is that we, in keeping with another 30 plus nations, are doing everything we can to give them the tools that they need to defend themselves and to push the Russians out. “

Some observers say the U.S. assessment of Ukraine’s ability to win has shifted over the past couple of weeks.

Anne Applebaum, Historian:

""Until the last week or so, I think Americans still weren't wholly convinced that Ukraine could win. And there were some doubts about whether, you know, these heavy weapons were necessary and so on. As I said, it feels to me like there's been a shift in the last week, and the decisions to give much more serious weapons have now been made.”

Ahead of Orthodox Easter this Sunday, European Council President Charles Michel said he strongly appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin during a phone call Friday to allow humanitarian access to the besieged city of Mariupol, where civilians remain trapped.

1376,bj8kZ3llS5E,CNBC Television,Here's what the first 3D-printed home for sale looks like,2021-02-25T17:22:44Z,25,"CNBC's Diana Olick reports on the first ever 3D-printed home for sale. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi 

The homebuilding industry is on the edge of a revolution.

At least that’s the way Kirk Andersen sees it. He just used 3D-printing technology to build a 900-square-foot model home on Long Island. He is about to build another one, too – the first 3D-printed home in the United States to be marketed to the public.

The new home will be slightly larger at 1,500 square feet and will feature three bedrooms, two bathrooms and a garage. It is listed at just under $299,000, about half the price of a comparable newly built home in the area.

Demand is off the charts.

“By the time I walk out of this house I’ll have 20 emails, 20 voicemails, and 20 texts, and by the time I get to respond to them I will have another 20 emails, 20 texts and 20 voicemails, so it’s nonstop,” said Stephen King, the real estate agent for the property.

Andersen is director of operations at SQ4D, a New York-based company with barely a dozen employees. While other companies have 3D-printed small structures that are being used to house the homeless, Andersen’s firm is the first company using the technology specifically for the for-sale market.

“We started making small, desktop 3D printers and came up with the idea that we needed to disrupt the housing market and the construction industry,” said Andersen.

So they scaled up their printer, a so-called Autonomous Robotic Construction System. After a lot of testing, they printed the foundation, interior and exterior walls and utility conduits for the model home in just two days.

It looks like a massive spout squeezing out concrete toothpaste in long lines, but the result is an incredibly solid, resistant structure. The raw walls look a bit like concrete corduroy, but they can be smoothed depending on the buyer’s tastes.

It requires little labor to build, and the price is low — two potentially attractive points as the industry contends with a severe labor shortage and high material costs.  

The recent spike in the price of lumber is hitting builders hard. It added about $26,000 to the cost of construction of the average home, according to a new estimate by the National Association of Home Builders. Concrete is far cheaper.

Homebuyers, too, are grappling with challenges in the market. Supply is tight for entry level buyers, while most of the growth these days is happening on the high end.

“We’re trying to build homes and houses in half the time for half the price,” said Andersen. “Our profits will be higher and we will be able to show that with more projects that we do.”

It wasn’t easy getting the permits to build the for-sale home, which is down the road from the model. Andersen said he had to work with local officials, teaching them about the process and the potential. He said the area’s zoning regulations are notoriously difficult. But, Andersen adds, that’s why he chose the location, so he would be ready for anything on ensuing projects.

Some people are just looking out of curiosity, but others are serious buyers. The Johnsons of Kansas City are hoping to move closer to where their son lives in New York.

“We’ve been looking since September of last year at a lot of homes in the two counties, and it’s just impossible to find anything at this price,” said Mitch Johnson.

“And this quality,” Patty Johnson chimed in.

There are already multiple offers on the house, some from regular buyers, others from investors. Andersen said he has also gotten a lot of interest from developers who want him to build 3D housing developments.

1299,veKMuJMDP5A,Voice of America,Spain Deploys Troops to Halt Migrant Crisis at Moroccan Border,2021-05-18T16:07:00Z,25,"Spain deployed troops and extra police, Tuesday, May 18, to repel thousands of migrants who were trying to get around security fences from Morocco. 
—————————
READ MORE: Spain's prime minister flew to the country's North African enclave Tuesday to contain a migration crisis with neighboring Morocco after 6,000 migrants swam or walked over the border.   

Videos emerged that appeared to show Moroccan soldiers opening security gates to let migrants through to the Spanish port city.   

“This sudden arrival of irregular migrants is a serious crisis for Spain and Europe,” said Pedro Sanchez in a televised address to the nation before travelling to Ceuta and Melilla, another Spanish enclave bordering Morocco.   

Experts suggested this huge influx, which included entire families, was an attempt by Morocco to pressure Spain to alter its policy toward Western Sahara, the disputed territory to which Rabat lays claim.  

Morocco and Spain have been mired in a diplomatic dispute over the presence in Spain of a Polisario Front leader, whose movement has fought for the independence of Western Sahara.

1377,z-Z8tkxQyNg,CNBC Television,Pfizer: Booster dose of Covid vaccine neutralizes omicron variant,2021-12-08T12:25:16Z,25,"CNBC's Meg Tirrell joins 'Squawk Box' to break down the latest data from Pfizer and BioNTech, which said three doses of their coronavirus vaccine neutralize the worrisome omicron variant. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi 

Three doses of Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine provide a high level of protection against the omicron variant of the virus that causes Covid-19, the companies announced Wednesday.

A booster shot of the vaccine increases antibody protection 25-fold compared with the initial two-dose series, according to a preliminary lab study. A third shot shows virus-fighting abilities comparable with the 95% protection provided by two doses against the original strain of the virus.

The companies said two doses of the vaccine showed a significant reduction in the ability of antibodies to target and neutralize omicron, though they may still protect against severe disease.

“Although two doses of the vaccine may still offer protection against severe disease caused by the Omicron strain, it’s clear from these preliminary data that protection is improved with a third dose of our vaccine,” Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a joint statement with BioNTech.

“Ensuring as many people as possible are fully vaccinated with the first two dose series and a booster remains the best course of action to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” Bourla said.

Bourla, in an interview Wednesday on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” said the lab test was against a synthetic, lab-produced copy of the virus. He said Pfizer and BioNTech are working to reproduce the same results with the real virus in a week or two. Those results would be more accurate, he said.

“The ultimate proof is coming from real-world data,” Bourla told CNBC. He said the companies need to know how many breakthrough infections occur and the severity of the cases in people who have received boosters compared with those who have had the two-dose initial series.

Bourla said real world data will show how long the booster dose provides protection against omicron. “At a certain point I think we will need a fourth dose,” he told CNBC.

Pfizer and BioNTech will have enough data by the end of the month to determine whether a booster dose is enough to fight omicron or if a new vaccine is needed, Bourla said. The companies expect to have a vaccine that specifically targets omicron available by March 2022.

Ugur Sahin, co-founder and CEO of BioNTech, said booster campaigns around the world could give people better protection against omicron as winter approaches. Public health officials are concerned Covid infections will spike as people gather more indoors to escape the cold

“Our preliminary, first dataset indicate that a third dose could still offer a sufficient level of protection from disease of any severity caused by the Omicron variant,” Sahin said in the joint statement.

The data comes after a small, preliminary lab study by South African scientists found that omicron evaded the protection provided by antibodies to a significant degree in blood samples taken from individuals fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

Bourla said on Tuesday that omicron appears to cause milder symptoms, but seems to spread faster and could lead to more mutations in the future.

“I don’t think it’s good news to have something that spreads fast,” Bourla told The Wall Street Journal during an interview at the paper’s CEO Council Summit. “Spreads fast means it will be in billions of people and another mutation may come. You don’t want that.”

While scientists believe that omicron spreads faster, they have said that more data is needed to determine the severity of disease caused by the variant.

“We will have a good understanding let’s say before the year-end as to what exactly it means for clinical manifestation,” Bourla said Tuesday in reference to the omicron variant.

“The Pentagon is rolling out military hardware for a Fourth of July unlike any other. Tanks on the National Mall and military flyovers will be part of the capital's celebration, by order of President Trump. He'll be the first president to take an active role in any July Fourth ceremony in recent memory.

These flyovers cost tens of thousands of dollars per hour, though military officials say they are essentially training flights and therefore not an extra cost to taxpayers. But the National Park Service is reportedly diverting nearly $2.5 million, originally intended for parks across the country, for the celebration.

""Certainly going to be more expensive than previous years. Anytime you get a presidential visit there are inherent security costs,"" said Mark Litterst of the National Park Service.

The National Park Service said on Tuesday it was still waiting for the run of show from the White House – proof this is a show, one stage-managed by the president down to the placement of tanks and infantry vehicles and the sequence of military flyovers, reports CBS News' Major Garrett. The Fourth of July is typically nonpartisan and a tribute to America's founding documents and self-government. 
 
The event is being called is called a ""Salute to America"" but Mr. Trump has made it clear that  the military will be front and center. ""We have some incredible equipment, military equipment on display – brand new. And we're very proud of it,"" Mr. Trump said.”

1382,jsdY3lv55hQ,CNBC Television,Cargo ship blocking Suez Canal costs billions in delays of goods,2021-03-26T17:01:35Z,25,"The stranded mega-container vessel, Ever Given in the Suez Canal, is holding up an estimated $400 million an hour in trade, based on the approximate value of goods that are moved through the Suez every day, according to shipping data and news company Lloyd's List. It could take days, even weeks, to re-float the cargo ship. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi 

The stranded mega-container vessel, Ever Given in the Suez Canal, is holding up an estimated $400 million an hour in trade, based on the approximate value of goods that are moved through the Suez every day, according to shipping data and news company Lloyd’s List.

Lloyd’s values the canal’s westbound traffic at roughly $5.1 billion a day, and eastbound traffic at around $4.5 billion a day. The blockage is further stressing an already strained supply chain, said Jon Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy for the National Retail Federation.

“Every day that the vessel remains wedged across the canal adds delays to normal cargo flows,” he said, adding that the trade group’s members are actively working with carriers to monitor the situation and determine the best mitigation strategies. “Many companies continue to struggle with supply chain congestion and delays stemming from the pandemic. There is no doubt the delays will ripple through the supply chain and cause additional challenges.”

The Suez Canal, which separates Africa from Asia, is one of the busiest trade routes in the world, with approximately 12% of total global trade moving through it. Energy exports like liquified natural gas, Crude oil, and refined oil make up 5% to 10% of global shipments. The rest of the traffic is largely consumer products ranging from fire pits to clothing, furniture, manufacturing, auto parts and exercise equipment.

“The key to this problem hinges on how much longer it will take to move the Ever Given,” explained Alan Baer, President of logistics provider, OL USA LLC. “USA importers face arrival delays of three days right now and this will continue to grow as long as the disruption continues.”

""Democratic New York Congressman Hakeem Jeffries laid out a methodical case for impeaching President Donald Trump that concluded with a devastating blow to a favorite talking point of Trump’s defenders.

On Thursday morning, the House Judiciary Committee continued its markup hearing on the articles of impeachment against Trump, and Rep. Jeffries delivered a powerful set of remarks in support of those articles.

Picking up on a phrase used by Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) in defense of Trump moments earlier — during which Jordan pointed out that aid to Ukraine was ultimately released — Jeffries began by saying “Let’s actually go through the facts.”

Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet and Green Party Leader Annamie Paul each faced questions on their leadership qualities and shortcomings from moderator Shachi Kurl at the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Que.

As the topics moved into climate change, Indigenous reconciliation, affordability and the COVID-19 pandemic, all five leaders defended their records and plans. But Trudeau, who is seeking a third term as prime minister, faced the harshest scrutiny.

The election will take place Sept. 20, 2021.

""The House Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused each other Tuesday of trying to intimidate State Department officials called as witnesses in the probe.

Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), who heads the foreign affairs panel.

The Democrats’ statement came after Pompeo informed them hours earlier that five State Department officials called to give depositions in the inquiry into President Trump’s actions regarding Ukraine over the next two weeks would not appear as scheduled this week.""

Organizers transported the 18 kings and four queens from the Egyptian Museum and through the capital in chronological order according to their reign.

One of the biggest draws of Saturday’s event was King Ramses II, who ruled for 67 years and is thought to have signed the first known peace treaty.

Each mummy was carried on specialized vehicles outfitted with shock absorbers and accompanied by a motorcade.

""The leader of Finland denied on Sunday that he’d ever told President Donald Trump that the small Nordic nation relies upon “raking” its forests to prevent wildfires — even though Trump promoted the dubious conservation method during a visit to flame-ravaged California over the weekend.

“You look at other countries where they do it differently, and it’s a whole different story,” Trump said Saturday, standing alongside Gov. Jerry Brown and Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom of California among the charred ruins of the Skyway Villa Mobile Home and RV Park in the town of Paradise.""

I really believe in the business, he says, it's an incredible team. Subscribe to CNBC PRO for access to investor and analyst insights on bitcoin and more: https://cnb.cx/2BT2E7y 

Bitcoin smashed through $40,000 to hit a new record high on Thursday helping to lift the total value of the entire cryptocurrency market above $1 trillion for the first time.

The digital coin hit an all-time high of $40,367 at around 1:17 p.m. ET, just a few hours after blowing past the $39,000 level, according to data from Coin Metrics.

Bitcoin pared some of its gains after hitting a record, last trading at $38,885, up 9.1% higher from a day earlier. The cryptocurrency is up over 30% since the start of 2021 and in the past 12 months has surged 400%.

Social Capital’s Chamath Palihapitiya thinks the digital currency has a long runway ahead even after its massive rally.

“It’s probably going to $100,000, then $150,000, then $200,000,” Palihapitiya told CNBC’s “Halftime Report.” “In what period? I don’t know. [Maybe] five or 10 years, but it’s going there.”

“The reason [it’s going there] is because, every time you see all of this stuff happening, it reminds you that our leaders are not as trustworthy and reliable as they used to be,” he said. “So, just in case, we really do need to have some insurance we can keep under our pillow that gives us some access to an uncorrelated hedge.”

The value of the entire cryptocurrency market, which is made up of bitcoin and other digital coins like ether and tether, surpassed $1 trillion for the first time earlier on Thursday, according to data from Coinmarketcap. Bitcoin is by far the most dominant cryptocurrency, with a market value of over $700 billion.

Bitcoin’s resurgence has been attributed to a number of factors including more buying from large institutional investors. High-profile investors like Paul Tudor Jones, for example, have been buying the digital currency.

Many bitcoin bulls say the cryptocurrency is akin to “digital gold,” a potential safe haven asset and a hedge against inflation. In a recent research note, JPMorgan said bitcoin could hit $146,000 in the long term as it competes with gold as an “alternative” currency. The investment bank’s strategists noted that bitcoin would have to become substantially less volatile to reach this price, however. Bitcoin is known for wild price swings.

The idea of bitcoin as a hedge against inflation has continued to gain steam as governments around the world embark on large-scale fiscal stimulus programs. Analysts argue this could cause a spike in inflation.

“This latest bull run in January is sure to attract the asset managers’ attention to diversify even more of their assets to crypto as they are keen on finding alternative investments, such as cryptocurrency or gold, to hedge inflation and geopolitical risks,” Simons Chen, executive director of investment and trading at cryptocurrency financial services firm Babel Finance, told CNBC.

“A large number of retail investors have also joined the race recently as they fear to miss out on opportunities to make easy, quick gain from the latest bull run,” he added.

Bitcoin’s rise has also been helped by moves in the space from big financial firms like PayPal and Fidelity. PayPal last year launched a feature that lets its users invest in cryptocurrencies, and is planning to offer crypto payments across its massive network of retailers later this year.

Read more here: https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/20/entertainment/meghan-mccain-walks-off-the-view-trnd/index.html

“(CNN) Friday's airing of ABC's The View appeared to get a little more heated than normal. During the episode, Meghan McCain walked off the set as cameras panned the studio heading into a commercial.

It's unclear why McCain walked off the stage, but right before the break she and guest host Ana Navarro got into a disagreement as the group discussed whistleblowers and leakers, including WikiLeaks' Julian Assange.

As the panel voiced their opinions regarding McCain's comments, McCain tried to clarify as she talked over the other hosts: ""Excuse me, maybe I was clumsy in the way that I said it.”

Navarro responded, telling her that she ""didn't have to yell.""

5:37 The jury ruled that Heard defamed Depp with malicious intent in a 2018 Washington Post op-ed claiming that she was a victim of domestic abuse.

Depp was awarded $15-million in total – $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages.

The jury also awarded Heard $2 million in compensatory damages, ruling that Depp’s lawyer Adam Waldman defamed her when he called her abuse claims “a hoax” in a British newspaper.

Depp, who is out touring, did not appear in the courtroom for the verdict. Heard, however, was in attendance.

43:23 Lawyers Ben Chew and Camille Vasquez celebrated the verdict outside court.

Apartheid, the Afrikaans word for ""apartness,"" was made up of a collection of strict laws targeting visible minorities in the country and is viewed as one of the darkest periods in the nation's history.

For nearly half a century, non-white South Africans were stripped of their freedoms and suffered under government imposed restrictions.

The face of the anti-apartheid movement became Nelson Mandela - who was jailed as a political prisoner for 27 years - whom would later become the nation's president and an icon of freedom and justice.

So, how could institutionalized discrimination take hold in South Africa, and what steps were taken to bring an end to apartheid?

“LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- President Donald Trump attended a fundraising dinner in Beverly Hills and made an appearance at his privately owned golf club in Rancho Palos Verdes on Friday. 

Trump made the visit to Los Angeles after touring a section of recently rebuilt border fencing in Calexico. 

The president's rare visit to California is part of a renewed push to make border security a central campaign issue for his 2020 re-election. 

""There is indeed an emergency on our southern border,"" Trump said at the briefing, adding that there has been a sharp uptick in illegal crossings. ""It's a colossal surge and it's overwhelming our immigration system, and we can't let that happen. ... We can't take you anymore. We can't take you. Our country is full.""

1391,LQih5OqA5kg,CNBC Television,Massive cargo ship still stuck in Egypt's Suez Canal could take weeks to clear,2021-03-25T16:17:19Z,25,"The massive container ship that ran aground in the Suez Canal, halting traffic in one of the world's busiest waterways, is still stuck. The ship, called the Ever Given, became horizontally wedged in the waterway following heavy winds. Nearly 19,000 ships passed through the canal during 2020, for an average of 51.5 per day, according to the Suez Canal Authority. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi 

The massive container ship Ever Given has now been stuck in the Suez Canal for three days, halting billions of dollars in trade as vessels pile up on either side of the waterway.

More than 150 ships are currently waiting to pass through the 120 mile man-made canal, according to estimates from research firm StoneX.

Images captured from vessel tracker MarineTraffic show the extent of the buildup.

The canal handles around 12% of seaborne trade, making it an essential point of passage. Each additional day that the ship is delayed disrupts more than $9 billion worth of goods, according to the Associated Press citing estimates from Lloyd’s List.

Research firm StoneX noted that 24 of the vessels are carrying crude, 15 are refined product tankers, and 16 are liquified natural gas/liquified petroleum gas product carriers.

For ships waiting to cross the canal, alternate options are limited.

“As delays continue, shippers will have to broach the unpalatable decision of whether to make a U-turn and head for the Cape of Good Hope or wait it out in the Red Sea and Mediterranean,” commodity data company Kpler wrote in a note to clients.

Re-routing significantly increases a trip’s length, which translates to higher costs. Sailing from the Suez Canal to Amsterdam takes just over 13 days when traveling at 12 knots, compared to 41 days if traveling around the Cape of Good Hope.

“The event highlights the relative fragility of the on-water trading system, particularly for those flows for which Suez Canal transits make up a higher percentage of total volumes moved,” the firm added.

The ship became horizontally wedged in the waterway following heavy winds. Multiple tugboats were sent to the scene, and a team from Smit Salvage has been called in to assist with the operation.

“Dredging operations to assist refloating the vessel continue. In addition to the dredgers already on site a specialised suction dredger has arrived at the location,” Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, which is the technical manager of the vessel, said in a statement. The firm said an early attempt to re-float the vessel on Thursday was unsuccessful, and that another attempt would be made later in the day.

The enormous cargo carrier is more than 1,300 feet long and about 193 feet wide. It weighs more than 200,000 tons. One end of the ship was wedged into one side of the canal, with the other stretching nearly to the other bank.

Nearly 19,000 ships passed through the canal during 2020, for an average of 51.5 per day, according to the Suez Canal Authority. The ship was sailing from China to Rotterdam when it ran aground.

Dawna Friesen has more on Trudeau's message to Canadians. Plus, David Akin reports on Trudeau's promise to help those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and how the Bank of Canada is reacting to the crisis.

In an effort to control the spread of COVID-19 in Canada, the federal government is asking Canadians to eliminate all non-essential travel outside the country. Jeff Semple looks at some of the measures in place during the pandemic.

U.S. President Donald Trump has now declared a national emergency over COVID-19, which will free up $50 billion in aid, and waived restrictions for hospitals in their response. As Abigail Bimman reports, life in the country has largely ground to a halt.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared Europe the new epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic, as that continent reports more cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined, excluding China. Europe is also reporting more new cases every day than China did at the height of its epidemic. Crystal Goomansingh reports on the latest measures to keep people healthy.

As some countries and some Canadian provinces close schools due to COVID-19, questions are being raised about whether the rest of Canada should follow suit. As Ross Lord reports, the right approach is a lesson in itself.

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, concern is growing for Canadians living in remote regions of this country with limited access to medical services. Heather Yourex-West looks at what's being done to prepare Indigenous communities.

More than 130,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide and roughly half of the people who caught the virus have already recovered. Eric Sorensen looks at the silver linings of this seemingly dark time.

""President Donald Trump briefly emerged Tuesday to tout the Dow Jones Industrial Average breaking 30,000 for the first time ever, and then vanished after a minute without taking questions.

The president’s mini-appearance, perhaps his shortest-ever remarks from the lectern of the White House briefing room, came less than a day after his administration took a major step toward the transition to Joe Biden’s presidency.""*

In November 2021, the Trudeau government announced that Canadian truckers crossing into the U.S. would need to be vaccinated or face a 14-day quarantine. The policy took effect last Saturday despite opposition from the trucking industry, which warned it could lead to supply chain issues. 

But as Brittany Rosen reports, the protest raises questions about the feasibility of restrictive public health decisions.

COVID-19 has now spread to at least 50 countries, making tens of thousands of people ill. Global News looks at the drastic steps governments around the globe are taking to mitigate the risks. Also, a woman in California has become America's first confirmed COVID-19 case of ""unknown"" origin. Jackson Proskow explains the mystery surrounding this case, how thousands of people in California are now being monitored and how the case exposes a gap in the country's response to the virus.

Meanwhile, in Canada, after weeks of protests and rail blockades, Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett is in northern B.C. to meet with the Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs opposed to the Coastal GasLink pipeline. As Sarah MacDonald reports, Bennett's visit comes just hours after the meeting was abruptly cancelled over what's been labelled a miscommunication. Plus, a rail blockade on Kahnawake Mohawk territory near Montreal is entering its third week, in a show of solidarity with Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs against Coastal GasLink's pipeline project in northern B.C. Mike Armstrong explains why a court injunction to remove protesters hasn't been acted upon.

Alberta's UCP government has tabled its second budget in just four months, as the province continues to suffer through a prolonged downturn in the oil and gas sector. But as Heather Yourex-West reports, the government says hope is on the horizon.

And Canadian feds have launched new protections for a certain aquatic creature. Ottawa is ramping up measures meant to protect endangered North Atlantic right whales, following the death of dozens in Canadian waters over the past three years. Ross Lord reports on the new rules, and why researchers say the new rules are similar to previous ones.

Trump’s aides had to explain the issue, which one diplomatic source said came up on “a constant basis,” but it wasn’t easy.

“He wasn’t great with recognizing that the leader of a country might be 80 or 85 years old and isn’t going to be awake or in the right place at 10:30 or 11 p.m. their time,” said a former Trump NSC official. “When he wants to call someone, he wants to call someone. He’s more impulsive that way. He doesn’t think about what time it is or who it is,” added a person close to Trump.

In the case of Abe and others, Trump’s NSC staffers would advise him, for instance, that “the time is messed up, it’s 1 o’clock in the morning” and promise to put the call on his calendar for a more diplomatically appropriate time. Former national security adviser H.R. McMaster would assure him: “We can try to set it up.”

548,8Isd671xvlE,The Young Turks,Pence Getting Fired By Trump?,2019-09-06T03:30:02Z,25,"Rumors are swirling about Trump possibly replacing Vice President Mike Pence with Nikki Haley.

Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian, hosts of The Young Turks, break it down. MORE TYT: https://tyt.com/trial

Read more here: https://news.yahoo.com/tensions-strain-between-trump-pence-heading-into-2020-election-090031895.html

""When Vice President Mike Pence flew to Europe as the stand-in for President Trump at the 80th anniversary of the start of World War II, it appeared to be another sign that the famously fickle president trusted his vice president.

But Pence’s decision while in Ireland to stay at the Trump golf resort in Doonbeg, the area his grandfather emigrated from a century ago, caught Washington insiders as another act of fealty from a vice president derided at times as overly obsequious, even “oleaginous.”

On the surface, Trump and Pence insist they have a great relationship and are working closer than ever to win reelection in 2020. (They’ve consistently beaten back rumors that former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley is in the running to replace Pence on the 2020 ticket.)""

1346,OJdZY3gvgAI,euronews,The Netherlands has a new King,2013-04-30T16:27:07Z,25,"http://www.euronews.com/ The new Dutch King Willem-Alexander has been sworn in at a ceremony in Amsterdam's Nieuwe Kerk.

Willem Alexander becomes the first king of the Netherlands in more than 120 years, ascending a throne largely stripped of political power but still invested with huge symbolic significance.

With his wife Queen Maxima by his side, the King took the oath of allegiance. Outside the church, a massive crowd had gathered to follow the ceremony on giant screens.  

Like her mother and grandmother before her, Beatrix, who is 75, chose to abdicate after a 33-year reign, saying her son was ready and that it was time for the throne to be held by ""a new generation"".

Beatrix is a very popular Queen with an estimated 8 out of 10 Dutch people in favour of maintaining the monarchy. 

The abdication takes place on Queen's Day, a national holiday in The Netherlands, giving the Dutch an opportunity to gather and celebrate in what are rather morose economic times with the country back in recession. 

After her abdication, Queen Beatrix, the new King Willem-Alexander and his wife, Queen Maxima, appeared on the balcony of the Royal Palace in Amsterdam to an enthusiastic orange-clad crowd of well-wishers.

Nearly a million people are estimated to have converged on Amsterdam for the event, including more than 10,000 police officers deployed in a massive security operation. 

The new King and Queen were joined by their three daughters, the eldest of whom, nine-year-old Catharina-Amalia, becomes Princess of Orange and heir to the throne.

Tents have been set up for a massive weekend party where the bikers leave for their annual Canada Run bike ride. Police say bikers will have their motorcycles inspected and driver's licences checked — a power that police have under the Highway Traffic Act.
 
Hundreds of Hells Angels members snaked from through Toronto on Thursday for a memorial procession and subsequent gathering, under the watchful eye of police and causing traffic disruptions along the way.
 
The gathering was the culmination of a memorial ride for former Toronto chapter president Donny Petersen, who died last December at the age of 74. The outlaw bikers congregated at the unofficial clubhouse for the Toronto's Hells Angels, with their Harley-Davidson motorcycles and patches.

Officials have said the explosive material that was housed at the port was actually more than 2000 tons of ammonium nitrate, and the blast killed at least 135 people and wounded about 5,000. Scores of people remain missing.

Family members have turned to social media to request information on their lost loved ones. Global Affairs Canada has confirmed that at least one Canadian has requested consular assistance in Lebanon.

1728,ZvsJWideTVY,SABC News,Gold Mafia | Al Jazeera documentary on alleged gold trading in Zimbabwe,2023-03-24T19:38:30Z,25,"Part one of a documentary by Al Jazeera called Gold Mafia that focuses on Zimbabwe has shocked many. The news network has suggested there are more revelations to come. The documentary shows the Zimbabwean government is using gold smugglers to evade western sanctions. The gold mafia is licenced to buy gold from small producers that would otherwise have been smuggled out of the country. The mafia then exports the gold to Dubai. 

All the while money laundering is going on.The dirty money of criminals comes back to Zimbabwe as legitimate revenue from gold. Back in Dubai money from the gold sales is transferred into bank accounts and seems to be legitimate. There is also evidence showing that suggests the rhenium president is condoning his own officials facilitating laundering, land that people are charged to see the president.

But as Mike Armstrong reports, things aren't so rosy for a different industry.

Meanwhile, the virus has led to the unemployment of thousands of Canadians, and the federal government is racing to mitigate the damage of what may be the worst economic downturn in the country's history. David Akin reports on how much the federal government’s potential support package could be worth.

The U.S. is ramping up its war against COVID-19 by closing its borders with Canada and Mexico to non-essential travel, while lockdowns are in effect in both California and New York. But what about a nationwide lockdown? And what would U.S. President Donald Trump say to Americans who are scared? Jackson Proskow has Trump's reaction to both of those questions.

The British government is also taking drastic measures to help citizens who can't work due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Redmond Shannon explains what's being promised.

Scores of Canadians working and living abroad are trying in vain to return home, but travel restrictions and bans over COVID-19 have them fearing they'll be stranded indefinitely. Ross Lord has the calls for help from Canadians stuck in Peru.

There's a worldwide outpour of gratitude for health care workers, who are putting themselves at risk while treating a surge of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Eric Sorensen explains how their difficult work is being honoured.

It flew through Canadian airspace and Global News has learned pilots were warned by air traffic controllers to be on the lookout for an untethered balloon. Jackson Proskow reports on how the U.S. is responding.

Tensions between Canada and China are also rising with the balloon having passed over Canada this week. Chief political correspondent David Akin has more on what the federal government has been saying.

These types of balloons are not new. In fact, similar tactics have been used for espionage in the early days of the Cold War. Eric Sorensen takes a look at the balloon and explores why old-fashioned technology is being used in the age of sophisticated satellites.

There are new concerns over the worldwide spread of another virus: avian flu. For more than a year, there's been a significant uptick in cases among wild birds and farmed poultry. Now, there's new evidence the illness is spreading among other mammals. Heather Yourex-West reports.

European Union leaders met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Friday. As Redmond Shannon reports, he once again pled for stronger weapons as the country approaches one year in Russia's war.

And finally, NASA is taking the threat of an asteroid hitting the Earth seriously and working on a planetary defence program for that very reason. Global's Su-Ling reports on the recent big step it took towards its protection program.

Police are moving in to enforce the court order against protesters at the Ambassador Bridge blockade. They’ve disrupted North America’s busiest international crossing for six days now. A state of emergency is in effect in Ontario with demonstrations also underway at the Peace Bridge in Fort Erie. And in Ottawa, thousands gathered in the downtown core and at the National War Memorial. A counter-protest is picking up steam. Sean O’Shea is in Windsor, Ont. at the Ambassador Bridge where police have begun to move in. 
 
Day 16 of what the prime minister and police are calling an illegal occupation in our nation’s capital. All available officers are being deployed to enforce safety and to encourage protesters to leave, but the disruption continues. Crowds swelled in Ottawa’s downtown core again and as Abigail Bimman reports, the National War Memorial has become a flashpoint. 
 
With Alberta rapidly winding down its COVID-19 restrictions, Premier Jason Kenney says it’s not because of the ongoing blockade in Coutts, near the Alberta-Montana border crossing that’s disrupted traffic there for two weeks. The Canada Border Services Agency says services there are now temporarily suspended. Mercedes Stephenson has more. 
 
Fearing a Russian invasion is imminent, the U.S. is the latest country to tell its citizens to leave Ukraine.  Canada has already done so, but Global Affairs says nearly 800 registered Canadians are still there. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau offered support to Ukraine’s president in a phone call today, but as Jennifer Johnson reports, some are urging him to do more. 
 
Scientists are taking a giant step forward in spinal injury research, published this week in the journal Nature Medicine. As Mike Drolet shows us, Swiss-based researchers have developed a spinal implant that’s enabling a paraplegic to walk again.

Ross Lord reports on Nova Scotia declaring a state of emergency with strict new rules and penalties for those not practicing social distancing. Meanwhile, Mike Armstrong looks at what other provinces are doing – and not doing – to prevent people from ignoring social distancing and self-isolation guidelines.

Jeff Semple reports on the difficulty our health care workers face in the COVID-19 pandemic, as they face a critical shortage of life-saving supplies, while Amanda Jelowicki explains how funeral homes are helping grieving families lay loved ones to rest when social gatherings are meant to be limited.

As many of us experience what it’s like to be in self-isolation for the first time, Robin Gill has a message from a famous Canadian – former astronaut Chris Hadfield – about how to make the most of your time inside. To bring some levity to a difficult situation, Mike Drolet looks at the good deeds some Canadians are doing to support their communities during a tough time.
