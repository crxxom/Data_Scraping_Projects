Mauricio Pochettino makes defiant statement over Levi Colwill future,"Jul 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/mauricio-pochettino-defiant-statement-levi-colwill-future,"Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino made a firm declaration about the future of Levi Colwill in the wake of the Blues beating Brighton 4-3 in a pre-season game in Philadelphia. Having never played a senior game for Chelsea, Colwill spent last season on loan at Brighton and became a regular starter in the second half of the campaign as the Seagulls secured a sixth place Premier League finish to qualify for the Europa League group stage. Brighton had been keen on a permanent transfer and at one stage were weighing up the possibility of launching a club record Â£40m bid for the 20-year-old defender. 90min reported at the start of July that Chelsea were adamant Colwill is not for sale. Liverpool also held interest and made an enquiry, only to be knocked back. Chelsea have since also lost Wesley Fofana to long-term injury and have even asked Manchester United about Harry Maguire. Brighton are prepared to admit defeat in their Colwill pursuit in favour of going after former Rangers defender Calvin Bassey, 23, who joined Ajax last summer. The bigger threat to Chelsea appears to be Liverpool, who 90min understands are confident despite the 'not for sale' stance at Stamford Bridge. feed Â Pochettino was bullish about Colwill's situation after the youngster played against Brighton. ""We don't need to make a statement about anything. He's our player and he's going to continue with us,"" the Argentine said. ""I am happy with him, his performance was good today, better than what I expected because it's only the first game with us after the season in Brighton. ""I think he can be one of the greatest centre-backs in England. He is going to be part of our team."" Pochettino is particularly noted for his track record of developing emerging talent, having played a major role in the early careers of players like Harry Kane, Son Heung-min, Luke Shaw, James Ward-Prowse, Dele Alli, Christian Eriksen and Eric Dier."
Marco Silva updates on his and Aleksandar Mitrovic's Fulham futures,"Jul 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/marco-silva-updates-aleksandar-mitrovic-fulham-futures,"Fulham manager Marco Silva has confirmed he has received an offer to move to Saudi Arabia, as well as admitting that the Cottagers are assesing the future of Aleksandar Mitrovic. Fulham flew to America before the weekend ahead of a pre-season tour. But while they were travelling, Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli made a fresh attempt to lure Silva away. The Portuguese coch, who oversaw Fulham's impressive 10th place finish last season in their first year back in the Premier League, has previously shunned such interest. But Al Ahli have returned with a two-year offer worth around Â£40m and that is now being considered. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Silva has held talks with Fulham's American-based owner Shahid Khan, who is looking to persuade him to commit his future to the club. Silva currently has a year left on his current deal and has turned down numerous offers of a new deal. ""I will not lie to you and say I havenât received an offer, the club know that. But I will not talk nothing more about that,"" said Silva after landing in the United States. ""I donât need to say many words here. I showed my commitment to the club so many times last season, in June again. My commitment to this club is total."" As well as Silva, the Saudi Pro League are also attempting to land Fulham's star striker Aleksandar Mitrovic. Two bids from Al Hilal have been rejected, with the last one worth just over Â£30m, but Fulham have made it clear he won't leave unless their valuation is met. feed ""Letâs talk clearly about the situation of Mitrovic,"" Silva said. ""Itâs not he ideal scenario, I have to do tell you of course. As you know heâs not going to play on Sunday and he didnât play last Wednesday, heâs not working properly with his team-mates and when I say itâs not the ideal scenario, this is the situation. ""I have spoken to Mitro already, he knows my opinion. Iâm here to give my best for all my players to protect them in everything I can.â Silva is believed to be considering signing a new deal at Fulham, but he is concerned about the future plans and their vision. ""The situation is more than just one player being linked,"" he explained. ""We lost seven players from last season, the main ones are still here and under me but when you lose a big number of players and have to prepare for aÂ Premier LeagueÂ season and you didnât sign at least one, at least to make the fans a bit more happy with the situation, this is the biggest thing for me. All the other things, I manage in an easy way."" Fulham for their part, are looking at options away from Silva and one of those is understood to be former Chelsea boss Graham Potter. The club are also looking at making inroads in the transfer market and are close to wrapping up deals for Mohammed Salisu and Calvin Bassey. The Cottagers have agreed terms with Southampton and Ajax respectively, for both defenders and they are similar in size worth around Â£15m each. They have moved on from Fiorentina defender Igor - who is close to agreeing a move to Brighton instead."

The Brazil international made 50 appearances in all competitions and scored once for the Red Devils after signing from Porto in 2020, vying with Luke Shaw for the left back position. However, the England international soon nailed that spot down and Telles spent the 2022/23 campaign on loan with Sevilla, winning the Europa League. feed He will now reunite with Cristiano Ronaldo, who famously left Man Utd before the 2022 World Cup and later signed for Al Nassr as one of the first major players to move to the Middle East. The deal to take Telles to Al Nassr had stalled, with the defender previously thought to be keen on returning to Brazil with Flamego instead of moving to Saudi Arabia.  He will join fellow new arrivals Seko Fofana and Marcelo Brozovic in Riyadh as well as Ronaldo and former Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina."
Jordan Henderson and Fabinho close in on Saudi Pro League moves,"Jul 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jordan-henderson-fabinho-close-in-saudi-pro-league-moves,"Jordan Henderson has completed a medical with Saudi Pro League side Al Ettifaq ahead of his Â£12m move from Liverpool. The England international has been pursued as a top target since Steven Gerrard's arrival in Dammam and a fee was recently agreed, signalling the end of Henderson's 12-year stay at Anfield. 90min understands only the finer details are left to be completed before the 33-year-old relocates permanently to the Middle East. He is due to link up with Gerrard's squad at their pre-season camp in Croatia. Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai have arrived on Merseyside with Liverpool's midfield rebuild forced into a quicker transition.

Brazilian Fabinho was recently granted permission to go for a medical with Saudi Pro League champions Al Ittihad, who have also added Karim Benzema and N'Golo Kante to their ranks this summer. 90min understands the defensive midfielder is now en route to Al Ittihad having already passed a medical. Final payment details over the Â£40m transfer - one of the biggest deals the Public Investment Fund (PIF) and the Pro League have agreed to - have also been smoothed out. Contemplating the loss of two established first team squad members, manager Jurgen Klopp says he is confident Liverpool will have a competitive team for the start of next season.

United have focused their efforts on 20-year-old Hojlund, who has openly discussed his desire to play for the Red Devils in the past, and have struck an agreement over personal terms with the Denmark international. The stumbling block currently is Atalanta's asking price. While the club have publicly demanded close to â¬100m, Atalanta are understood to be prepared to accept a fee of around â¬70m, but United are not prepared to meet such a demand at this point. Asked for an update on Hojlund's future at the club, Gasperini insisted the striker is loving life at Atalanta but admitted that money often plays a deciding factor. ""I haven't spoken about the future with Rasmus,"" Gasperini said. ""I think he is very comfortable here. feed ""Sometimes there are choices to make and also agents... we all have to consider the financial factor. Atalanta, due to certain contracts and figures, can hardly refuse certain offers. ""Iâd love to keep Rasmus of course but sometimes clubs and also players have to consider huge bids.""

Aston Villa confirm signing of Moussa Diaby from Bayer Leverkusen,"Jul 22, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/aston-villa-confirm-signing-moussa-diaby-bayer-leverkusen,"Aston Villa have completed the signing of winger Moussa Diaby from Bayer Leverkusen for a club-record fee. Saudi Arabian giants Al Nassr were also interested in Diaby and entered into a bidding war with Villa but the 24-year-old declined a move to the Middle East in favour of linking up with Unai Emery at Villa Park. The deal is now complete and Diaby has already travelled to the United States to link up with his new team for pre-season. Villa are understood to have parted with over Â£50m to sign Diaby, who becomes the Villans' new record signing. feed Diaby becomes Villa's third signing of the summer, following midfielder Youri Tielemans and centre-back Pau Torres in making the move to the West Midlands. It has been an expensive summer for Villa, who have relied on the experience of new director of football Monchi to help them land some high-profile targets and continue their push for European football next season. Diaby, naturally a right winger, enjoyed the most prolific season of his career last year. In 48 appearances across all competitions, the Frenchman racked up 14 goals and 11 assists, putting him back on the cusp of breaking into his national team. There will be a reunion at Villa Park for Diaby with fellow winger Leon Bailey, who left Leverkusen two years ago."
Kylian Mbappe: French players' union threatens legal action against PSG over pre-season snub,"Jul 22, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/kylian-mbappe-french-players-union-threatens-legal-action-psg-over-pre-season-snub,"France's National Union of Professional Footballers (UNFP) has threatened legal action against Paris Saint-Germain over the club's attempts to force Kylian Mbappe to accept a summer transfer. Having already confirmed his decision not to trigger his contract extension beyond next summer, Mbappe has been warned by PSG that he will be sold immediately if he does not agree to a new deal. To ramp up the pressure on Mbappe, PSG decided to leave the 24-year-old out of their pre-season squad, insisting to the French forward that his only options are to agree to leave or, preferably, sign an extension. PSG's tactics have been blasted by the UNFP, who accused the Ligue 1 side of breaking French law by intentionally forcing Mbappe to accept poorer working conditions. ""These players - all of them - must enjoy the same working conditions as the rest of the professional workforce,"" the union said. feed ""The UNFP feels it would be useful to remind managers that putting pressure on an employee - via the deterioration of their working conditions, for example - to force them to leave or accept what the employer wants constitutes moral harassment, which French law firmly condemns. ""So, yes, the UNFP reserves the right to take civil and criminal action against any club that behaves in this way."" Mbappe's situation has attracted the interest of Saudi Arabian officials but 90min understands the Frenchman has his heart set on a move to long-term suitors Real Madrid. Real Madrid sources have denied claims that an agreement has already been reached with Mbappe over a free transfer in 2024 although Los Blancos are planning to lure him over to the Santiago Bernabeu within the next 12 months. PSG's asking price could prevent Real Madrid from making a bid this summer, with the Spanish side prepared to wait until January to make contact over a free transfer instead."
Roberto De Zerbi pokes fun at Chelsea with fresh Moises Caicedo comments,"Jul 22, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/roberto-de-zerbi-pokes-fun-chelsea-moises-caicedo-comments,"Brighton manager Roberto De Zerbi has poked fun at Chelsea's lack of European football next season as he doubled down on his determination to keep hold of midfielder Moises Caicedo. Chelsea have seen a Â£70m bid for the Ecuador international rejected, with Brighton holding out for at least Â£100m or the inclusion of centre-back Levi Colwill as part of a swap deal - something De Zerbi was happy to float publicly on Friday. Further stressing his desire to keep hold of Caicedo, De Zerbi took the opportunity to remind Chelsea that their disastrous campaign last year has left them without European football next season, unlike the Seagulls. ""It's a clear situation at the moment. [Caicedo] stays with us until my owner changes his mind,"" De Zerbi told Ben Jacobs. ""I don't know what can happen in the future, but if Moises leaves we have to find the right player because itâs difficult to replace a player as good as Moises. We have to substitute him with a great player because this year we play in the Europa League unlike Chelsea."" feed De Zerbi was again asked about the potential of a reunion with Colwill, who Chelsea are adamant is not for sale. ""I don't speak with Colwill. We haven't spoken for a month,"" the Brighton manager claimed.  ""With Moises I spoke with him once but not about the transfer market. I can say my opinion, but it's not my job. I'm happy to meet [Levi] but not discuss anything else."" Finally, De Zerbi suggested that Caicedo's desire to leave may not be as strong as reports have suggested. ""You have to speak with Tony [Bloom, Brighton owner] not with me [to see] if he wants to leave,"" the boss said. ""He extended his contract in February and now we are in July, so after five months I don't know if he can change his idea."" "

Roberto De Zerbi proposes Moises Caicedo & Levi Colwill swap deal in press conference,"Jul 22, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/roberto-de-zerbi-proposes-moises-caicedo-levi-colwill-swap-deal-in-press-conference,"Brighton & Hove Albion head coach Roberto De Zerbi has admitted Chelsea can make negotiations for Moises Caicedo easier if they are willing to send Levi Colwill back as part of the deal. The Blues are interested in signing the Ecuador midfielder and saw a Â£70m bid knocked back by the Seagulls this week. Sources close to Brighton have told 90min that this offer was 'miles away' from their Â£100m valuation. While Chelsea want to bring Caicedo to Stamford Bridge, Brighton are interested in re-signing Colwill following his impressive loan spell last season. However, the west Londoners are determined to keep the centre-back. C Chelsea and Brighton face off this weekend as part of the Premier League Summer Series in the United States. In his pre-match press conference, the notoriously fiery De Zerbi sought to fan the flames of the two transfer sagas. ""Everyone is speaking about Moises, Chelsea maybe but me? No. The situation is very clear at the moment. Moises is a Brighton player and Tony Bloom told me, if the conditions don't change, Moises stays with us. For me, it would be great news,"" De Zerbi said. feed When asked if he had a verbal agreement to let Caicedo leave, the Italian replied: ""It is not true. I am coach, not owner, I'm not a sporting director. I'm only a coach. Believe me, it is difficult to be a coach."" De Zerbi then remarkably suggested the idea of a swap deal for the two, though did insist he would like to play Caicedo and Colwill in the same team again. ""There are two questions. Not only about Caicedo, also about Colwill, and maybe it can be [a swap],"" he continued. ""I would like to play with Caicedo and Colwill together but at the moment I can only speak about Caicedo as Colwill is not one of my players. ""I don't like speaking about players of other clubs. I speak about Caicedo because he's our player. With Levi, I am proud of him. He showed his quality at the Under-21 Euros."""
PSG looking to sell Kylian Mbappe this summer,"Jul 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-looking-to-sell-kylian-mbappe-this-summer,"Paris Saint-Germain are aiming to sell Kylian Mbappe this transfer window amid fears he will leave the club for free at the end of his contract next summer, sources have confirmed to 90min. Mbappe informed PSG earlier this summer that he would not extend his deal with the club beyond 2024. Les Parisiens then communicated to the forward that if he does put pen to paper on a new contract, they would explore the option of moving him on in order to recoup a transfer fee. Sources have now told 90min that Mbappe, who returned to pre-season training under new boss Luis Enrique recently, has been told to stay home by PSG ahead of their tour of Japan. Mbappe himself had expected to travel with his teammates out to Asia but the club are now looking to sell him following a frustrating contract standoff. feed Real Madrid have long been seen as Mbappe's top suitors should he leave PSG - he came close to joining them on a free transfer when his previous contract was expiring in 2022 before he had a change of heart - but a move to the Santiago Bernabeu might be difficult to complete immediately. 90min understands that PSG have placed a â¬200m asking price on Mbappe - a figure which Real Madrid will simply not pay. Los Blancos may consider making a move for Mbappe this summer if this tally is lowered to a figure in the â¬150m range, but it is more likely that they wait until January to finalise terms on a pre-contract agreement with the forward. Sources have told 90min that Mbappe and his representatives are unmoved by recent developments. They are insistent that he will not be forced out of PSG and will only move to another club when it suits them."
Chelsea confirm departure of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to Marseille,"Jul 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-confirm-departure-pierre-emerick-aubameyang-marseille,"Chelsea have confirmed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has left the club and signed for Marseille. The 34-year-old only joined the Blues at the end of the summer 2022 transfer window, reuniting with former Borussia Dortmund manager Thomas Tuchel. However, the German was sacked just days after Aubameyang's arrival. Aubameyang endured a largely unsuccessful campaign which culminated in an anonymous performance away at former club Arsenal, with Chelsea falling to a limp 3-1 defeat. Though he had offers to join clubs in the Saudi Pro League, Aubameyang has opted to remain in Europe and has joined Marseille on a free transfer. feed A statement from Chelsea read: ""Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has left Chelsea and joined Ligue 1 side Marseille. ""The Gabon international arrived at Stamford Bridge last summer from Barcelona and went on to make 21 appearances in all competitions for the Blues. ""He scored three goals for Chelsea, all of which came in the space of ten days in October. Aubameyang struck against Crystal Palace in the Premier League and converted in back-to-back Champions League group stage matches against AC Milan. ""We would like to thank Pierre and wish him well as he begins the next chapter of his career."""
Tottenham maintain refusal to set Harry Kane price tag,"Jul 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-maintain-refusal-harry-kane-price-tag,"Tottenham Hotspur are still refusing to set an asking price for star striker Harry Kane, sources have told 90min. Kane is the subject of intense transfer interest from Bayern Munich, who have already seen two bids knocked back by Spurs this summer. 90min previously reported that Kane's representatives have begun to put feelers out around Europe that he could be available with his contract up in 2024. However, 90min understands that Tottenham remain confident that he can be persuaded to stay in the long-term and have not been told by Kane's camp that this option is off the table. Reports from both England and Germany have suggested that Spurs may be tempted to move on from their all-time record scorer if a bid in excess of Â£100m were to arrive, particularly if the payment structure was favourable to them. However, sources have told 90min that chairman Daniel Levy and the Tottenham hierarchy are still not entertaining the thought of putting a price tag on Kane. New head coach Ange Postecoglou met Kane for the first time shortly before the first-team squad jetted off for their tour of Australia and Asia, with the 57-year-old maintaining that one single conversation would not decide his future. 90min understands that Spurs are hopeful a positive relationship between the two will prove a major factor in deciding the striker's future. feed Postecoglou has admitted, though, that he is 'not relaxed' about the transfer saga and hope it can be resolved quickly one way or another. ""Fair to say I am not relaxed about it! It's not something you go: 'Ah, well, you know if it does or doesn't happen!' I mean it's a very important part of this football club, not just the team, but the football club,"" Postecoglou said. ""He is such a massive figure, and as I have said already, whilst my focus isn't on it on a daily basis because I've got other things I need to do, I know that every time I am talking to you guys, or whenever Harry is going to talk, that's the first question you are going to get. ""So, you've got to deal with it, and I think, for everyone concerned, we don't want to be doing it for too long. I don't think that is good for anyone. I don't think it is good for Harry, I don't think it is good for the club, because as laser focused as we want to be, you end up sort of repeating yourself along the way. ""But the flip side of that is I don't want to put a deadline on it, because that adds even more pressure. You want these things to happen for the right reasons. The reality of it is he's still a contracted player at our football club, so thatâs the way I see him. ""It's not like his contract is ending on the 12th [of August] and he's got to make a decision, he's got another year. So from that part, I am not relaxed but I am not putting pressure on him or anyone else at the football club, saying 'well we need to do this'. But I donât think deep down any of us want it to go on for too long."""
"Man Utd transfer notebook: Bailly & Alex Telles close to Al Nassr, PSG progress on Ramos","Jul 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-transfer-notebook-bailly-alex-telles-al-nassr-psg-ramos-21-7-23,"Eric Bailly is in talks with Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr over a potential transfer from Manchester United, 90min understands. Bailly has been told he can leave United by manager Erik ten Hag and has not featured in the club's plans for the duration of the Dutchman's tenure - spending last season out on loan with Marseille. A clause to make the Marseille deal permanent was not triggered last season, so Bailly is back in United's hands and still under contract. He last signed a new deal in 2019. The Ivorian, who has struggled with injuries for a large chunk of his career, has not been included in United's pre-season plans however, is not on the club's tour of the United States, and has been told by the club to find a permanent move away. His camp are currently in discussions with Al Nassr over a move to Saudi Arabia. There is interest in the player from other clubs but United want the player to agree a permanent move away, and they are prepared to sign off a low cost deal themselves to get the player off their books. Alex Telles, meanwhile, could join Al Nassr too, with the deal understood to be back on after hitting a snag in recent hours. Telles is in the same boat as Bailly in terms of being told he's free to leave United, and was excused from rejoining the club at the start of pre-season in order to secure a move. Telles was also sent on loan to Sevilla last season. 90min reported earlier this week that a deal was close for Telles to join Al Nassr for a fee in the region of Â£4m. It's understood that Telles was initially keen on a move back to Brazil with Flamengo before interest from Al Nassr emerged, though predictably the transfer to Saudi Arabia provided a far more lucrative option for Telles and United themselves. United confirmed the signing of Andre Onana from Inter this week, and he has joined their tour of the USA - where United academy graduate and goalkeeping rival Dean Henderson currently finds himself. The signing of Onana has opened the door for Henderson to be sold, with Nottingham Forest at the front of the queue to sign their former loanee on a permanent transfer. A deal worth in the region of Â£20m-Â£25m has been in the pipeline for a number of weeks. However, Forest have been made aware of the availability of another former loanee in recent days - in the shape of Keylor Navas. Navas spent the second half of last season on loan at the City Ground from Paris Saint-Germain, and is free to leave the club this summer with Gianluigi Donnarumma firmly established at the club's first choice. Navas was expecting more offers at this stage than he has received and his representatives are understood to have reached back out to Forest to offer up the prospect, with Steve Cooper's side now pondering their next move. Spanish goalkeepers David Soria, of Getafe, and Brighton's Robert Sanchez are other alternatives for Forest. Forest are however set to complete the signing of Anthony Elanga from United, in a Â£15m deal.  You can read more on the story here. United have been made aware by the representatives of Benfica striker Goncalo Ramos that they are advancing in talks with PSG, 90min understands. Ramos was one of the players on United's long list of striker targets for the summer, though they have sharpened their focus on a deal for Atalanta's Rasmus Hojlund. As 90min reported this week, personal terms have been agreed in principle with the Danish striker and United are trying to thrash out agreeable terms with Atalanta in the region of â¬60m (Â£52m). PSG are looking for a new striker themselves and have held interest in Hojlund, but the 20-year-old wants the move to Old Trafford. The French champions have also looked at Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic, but are currently in talks over Ramos instead. Ramos made the headlines for Portugal at the 2022 World Cup, scoring a hat-trick against Switzerland. Benfica are looking for in the region of at least â¬80m (Â£69m) to sell the player, and are interested in signing Santiago Gimenez from Dutch champions Feyenoord as a replacement. Benfica have already signed Fredrik Aursnes and Orkun KÃ¶kÃ§Ã¼ from Feyenoord over consecutive summers."
Man Utd agree Â£15m deal to sell youngster to Nottingham Forest,"Jul 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-agree-15m-deal-sell-youngster-nottingham-forest,"Manchester United are set to receive a Â£15m fee from Nottingham Forest for Swedish winger Anthony Elanga, 90min understands. A deal was agreed between the two Premier League clubs on Friday, with the 21-year-old set to undergo a medical with Forest over the weekend. Forest are also working on a transfer for United goalkeeper Dean Henderson, who spent last season on loan at the City Ground. United are working on the sales of a number of fringe players to fund their desired transfer business for the summer, having spent a large chunk of their existing budget on the arrivals of Mason Mount from Chelsea, and Inter goalkeeper Andre Onana. feed Onana's arrival at United was confirmed on Thursday, and he has flown to the United States to join up with the club on their pre-season tour. Elanga himself is present in New York but is expected to say his goodbyes and leave the club in the coming days. Elanga was the subject of interest from a number of clubs and it's understood he has turned down the options of moving to Everton, who are proceeding with a deal for Arnaut Danjuma instead, and other clubs such as West Ham United. Initially joining United as a youngster in 2014, Elanga made his debut for the club in May 2021, and had a prolonged spell of matches in the team under former interim coach Ralf Rangnick. Current boss Erik ten Hag has however preferred the use of the likes of Antony, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho in wide positions since his appointment over a year ago. Elanga only managed 418 Premier League minutes for United last season."
Man City continue negotiations with RB Leipzig over frustrated Josko Gvardiol,"Jul 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-city-continue-negotiations-rb-leipzig-frustrated-josko-gvardiol,"Manchester City remain locked in negotiations with RB Leipzig over a payment structure to sign centre-back Josko Gvardiol, 90min understands. Gvardiol is City's top defensive target this summer and the European champions are happy to make the 21-year-old the most expensive centre-back in history by agreeing to a deal worth â¬100m, but nothing has been sealed. Sources close to the negotiations have confirmed to 90min that reports of an agreement between the two clubs are premature, with City and Leipzig still firmly locked in talks over the structure of any payments. Sporting director Max Eberl has even hinted that Leipzig would be prepared to walk away from the table if their demands are not met. ""The fact is Manchester City would like to have him, but currently we are very far apart,"" Eberl told Sky Germany. ""There is no agreement. Not even close. ""[Dominik] Szoboszlai's transfer [to Liverpool] secured us financially, we don't need money. We prefer Josko to stay."" feed Conversations between the two clubs are ongoing and Leipzig's refusal to accept City's current proposal is understood to have left Gvardiol and his representatives feeling frustrated. Leipzig are keen to receive as much money as possible for the Croatian and the fact that he is under contract until 2027 has only strengthened the German side's resilience in negotiations. Manager Marco Rose has also played down suggestions of an agreement and imminent medical for Gvardiol. ""Josko is one of our players and as far as I know he will remain one of our players,"" Rose argued. ""I don't know anything about a medical check, nothing about a first and nothing about a second. I think if it was, I would know as head coach!"""
Harry Maguire's potential destinations as Man Utd plan summer exit,"Jul 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/harry-maguire-potential-destinations-man-utd-summer-exit,"While he may have become a figure of ridicule for many football fans, there is a sadness about the way Harry Maguire's time at Manchester United has panned out. Arriving with all the pressure that comes with an Â£80m price tag, the England international arguably faced a losing battle from the moment he signed from Leicester. However, things weren't always as bleak at Old Trafford for Maguire, who was recently stripped of the Red Devils captaincy and replaced as permanent skipper by Bruno Fernandes. There were times he showed he can be a very good defender at Man Utd, particularly in the early stages of his time there. Maguire has now been told by Erik ten Hag he is free to leave United, with the Dutch manager even encouraging the centre back to pursue an exit having fallen down the pecking order dramatically in 2022/23. He is simply not as good as Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez and United may still add another defender during the transfer window. There are some potential options for Maguire this summer should he look to force a move, so here are some linked teams. Chelsea fans may squint at this prospect, but there is logic behind it.The recent anterior cruciate injury suffered by Wesley Fofana means Chelsea are light at the back and 90min has reported on the contact made with Man Utd about the England defender's situation.The Frenchman will be out of action for the majority of the 2023/24 season as his rotten luck with injuries continues, so there is a clear need to enter the market. The injury also means Levi Colwill is likely to stay put.It is favourable for United to sell him outright but they would entertain the idea of a loan and that would certainly suit Chelsea. It is unlikely Mauricio Pochettino would have enquired for Maguire if Fofana had not got injured, so a loan seems much more appealing. Another genuine link has come from West Ham. The Hammers have a genuine war chest to invest with following the exit of Declan Rice to Arsenal and some of that cash could be stumped up for Maguire, even though Irons boss David Moyes stayed coy when asked about reports of his side's interest.There is a lot that makes sense about this transfer, particularly from Maguire's perspective. He would still be very visible to England manager Gareth Southgate by remaining in the Premier League and would get a lot more game time than if he stayed at Old Trafford.Europa League football is also on offer at London Stadium after the success in the Europa Conference League. Tottenham have had a bit of a nightmare when it comes to centre backs in recent memory. The likes of Cristian Romero, Eric Dier, Davinson Sanchez and Clement Lenglet all left a lot to be desired during the 2022/23 campaign. Spurs' eighth-placed finish was their lowest since 2008/09, also becoming the first team in 15 years to both score and concede more than 60 goals in a single Premier League season. A new signing at the back is a pressing priority, with Edmond Tapsoba and Mickey van de Ven among their top targets.While Spurs may have loftier ambitions in the Premier League than West Ham, their interest in Maguire is previously documented with new manager Ange Postecoglou giving his approval to sign a new centre-back. Given he is a prominent international defender who plays for a huge club, Maguire will be a consideration for any side losing a similar player this summer. With Kim Min-jae departing for Bayern Munich this summer, Napoli are one such side.It's hard to imagine Maguire in another country but there is a space in the Serie A champions' squad he could fill. It would be a very different situation for Maguire to adjust to and Napoli would almost certainly want a loan deal with an option to buy. Some reconciliation would also be needed between Maguire and Aurelio De Laurentiis after the Napoli president made some choice comments about the defender.He said three years ago: ""In England, you know, they can spend â¬93m on a player thatÂ I would pay a maximum of â¬25-30m for. So, if Maguire costs â¬93m, then Koulibaly is worth â¬250m?"""
Barcelona's agreement to sign new right-back confirmed by sporting director,"Jul 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-agreement-sign-right-back-confirmed-sporting-director,"Deportivo La Coruna sporting director Fernando Soriano has confirmed the club have agreed a deal to sell right-back Trilli to Barcelona. Both Barcelona manager Xavi and president Joan Laporta have confirmed a new right-back is high on the club's wish list this summer after Hector Bellerin's short-lived return to Camp Nou failed to meet expectations. A whole host of senior names have been linked with the position, including Real Valladolid's Ivan Fresneda and Bayern Munich duo Joshua Kimmich and Benjamin Pavard, and the search for first-team reinforcements continues. At youth level, however, Barcelona have landed themselves one of Spain's most highly rated full-backs in 20-year-old Trilli, who is set to join up with Rafa Marquez's BarÃ§a Atletic side. ""We are writing all the documentation. His signing for BarÃ§a is imminent,"" Soriano told Sport. ""In fact, he is already allowed not to train with us because of how advanced everything is."" feed Trilli has been a regular for the third-tier side and has also represented Spain up to Under-19 level. He will initially help to reinforce a BarÃ§a Atletic side who have already lost a handful of big names this summer, including Victor Barbera and Ilias Akhomach. The door to Xavi's first team will obviously remain open, however, although the Blaugrana remain keen to find somebody capable of offering some immediate help. Sergino Dest, who has returned from his underwhelming loan with AC Milan, has voiced his desire to become Xavi's preferred right-back this summer, but a new signing is still expected through the door. Valladolid starlet Fresneda, who is actually two years younger than Trilli, is seen as a likely candidate, but the 18-year-old also has interest from the likes of Arsenal and Bournemouth."
Andrey Santos receives work permit ahead of new Chelsea season,"Jul 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/andrey-santos-receives-work-permit-new-chelsea-season,"Chelsea midfielder Andrey Santos has qualified for a work permit to allow him to play in the Premier League, 90min understands. The 19-year-old joined from Vasco da Gama for a fee of around Â£18m in January but narrowly missed out on a work permit and returned to the Brazilian club on a six-month loan deal. Having since made his international debut for Brazil, Santos has officially qualified for a work permit and is free to represent Chelsea in the Premier League next season. Blues fans got a first glimpse of Santos in action during the 5-0 victory over Wrexham in pre-season, with the teenager impressing in Mauricio Pochettino's first unofficial game for the club. Pochettino is keen to take a closer look at a number of his young midfielders before making a final decision on the make-up of his senior squad for next season, with Santos' permit now giving the 19-year-old more options for the coming campaign. feed Alongside Santos, Pochettino is also looking at 20-year-old Cesare Casadei and 19-year-old Carney Chukwuemeka, the latter of whom recently stressed his desire to remain at Stamford Bridge next season. ""He's [Pochettino] come in and said that he sees the talent that he wants to develop and to help develop me,"" Chukwuemeka said. ""Whether that's in a month or six months, but I want to stay. ""I want to prove to everyone what I can do and help the club. So, at the end of the day we'll sit down, come together and decide what's best for me."" Chelsea also remain in negotiations with Brighton over midfielder Moises Caicedo but there remains a gulf in valuation of the Ecuador international, who has been hit with an asking price of over Â£100m by the Seagulls."
Man Utd hold talks with Fiorentina star over potential summer transfer,"Jul 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-hold-talks-fiorentina-potential-summer-transfer,"Manchester United are among the sides to have spoken with the representatives of Fiorentina midfielder Sofyan Amrabat over a summer transfer, 90min understands. United have already brought in Mason Mount from Chelsea but are still in the market for a more defensive-minded midfielder as they prepare to listen to offers for both Fred and Scott McTominay. Amrabat, who shone at the World Cup with Morocco, is among the names on United's wish list and sources have confirmed to 90min that the Red Devils have spoken with Amrabat's representatives to figure out the terms of any potential deal. The 26-year-old, who is in the final year of his contract with Fiorentina, has been given permission to explore a move away and has been valued at â¬30m (Â£25.9m) by the Italian side. Atletico Madrid have also held talks over a move for Amrabat, while Liverpool and West Ham made early enquiries but have not yet advanced their interest. feed United have made it clear that they would need to offload a handful of players before formally pursuing a deal for Amrabat. McTominay has attracted interest from West Ham and Fred is wanted in both England and Saudi Arabia, while Eric Bailly, Alex Telles, Donny van de Beek and Anthony Elanga are among those expected to leave. In the meantime, Amrabat is due to return to Fiorentina training on Monday but the Morocco international is keen to see his future resolved before then. Fiorentina general manager Joe Barone recently admitted to Sky Italy: ""Sofi is very close to me, he speaks English and I hear from him almost every day. No official offers have arrived for him, I told him to arrive focused on Fiorentina, he must have the head to play in the Viola."" The Serie A side are already planning for Amrabat's exit and have struck a deal to sign Arthur from Juventus on loan with a view to a permanent deal."

West Ham near Carlos Borges deal; Elye Wahi of interest as Al Ettifaq eye Michail Antonio,"Jul 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-carlos-borges-elye-wahi-interest-al-ettifaq-michail-antonio,"West Ham United's summer transfer window could finally kick into gear with the Â£14m signing of Manchester City youngster Carlos Borges, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 19-year-old has attracted interest from a number of clubs after scoring goals at a prolific rate for City's Under-21 side - his 21 strikes helped them win the Premier League 2 title - and is in advanced talks over a move to London Stadium. The deal is expected to contain a buy-back clause for City, who regularly ensure they have the opportunity to re-sign some of their best academy talent, but would represent a significant piece of business for West Ham boss David Moyes. The Scot desperately needs to add more depth to West Ham's squad, with a place in the Europa League sealed after last season's sensational win over Fiorentina in the Conference League final, and Borges would be expected to challenge Said Benrahma for a first team place. Declan Rice has departed for Arsenal, in a British record move that could eventually be worth Â£105m to West Ham, and there's an appetite from West Ham to reinvest the initial chunk of money received for him into at least one central midfield recruit. Joao Palhinha, Edson Alvarez, Youssouf Fofana, Scott McTominay and Kalvin Phillips are among a handful of players interesting Moyes and new technical director Tim Steidten, who was appointed at the start of July to oversee recruitment this summer. 90min understands that West Ham are also eyeing a move for in-demand Montpellier striker Elye Wahi, as they anticipate a bid coming in for Michail Antonio from Saudi Pro League side Al Ettifaq, who are managed by Steven Gerrard. feed The 33-year-old has spent the last eight seasons with West Ham, scoring a club-record 61 Premier League goals, but is entering the final year of his contract and would be available for transfer should the club receive a suitable offer. Wahi is a prolific young striker who has enjoyed two breakout years at Montpellier. He scored 19 Ligue 1 goals last season as the club comfortably saw off the threat of relegation, and has held talks with Chelsea over a potential move this summer. However, the Blues are likely to loan Wahi to Strasbourg, the newest member of the BlueCo ownership group, if a deal were to go through, and 90min understands that's a switch the player isn't necessarily keen to make. Arsenal and Borussia Dortmund have also watched the 20-year-old while Eintracht Frankfurt see him as the perfect replacement for Randak Kolo Muani, who has been linked with a host of big clubs. Bournemouth, Crystal Palace and Wolves have also shown interest, while Lazio and Union Berlin are admirers in Italy and Germany respectively. West Ham have also held talks with Wolves over a deal for veteran full-back Aaron Cresswell. The 33-year-old has been in the capital since 2014, but wasn't a guaranteed starter for Moyes last season and could find his game time marginalised further should the club persist with the 3-5-2 formation they have operated with in the early stages of pre-season."
Sadio Mane agrees personal terms with Al Nassr in surprising U-turn,"Jul 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/sadio-mane-agrees-personal-terms-al-nassr-surprising-u-turn,"Bayern Munich forward Sadio Mane has agreed a deal in principle to join Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, sources have confirmed to 90min. The former Liverpool star has been one of the more high-profile players linked with a move to the Middle East this transfer window. Mane is coming off the back of a rather underwhelming debut season with Bayern, scoring 12 goals in 38 games across all competitions and rose to infamy when he got into a physical altercation with teammate Leroy Sane following a Champions League loss. 90min reported in May that Bayern would field offers for Mane, though he initially refused to discuss a move to Saudi Arabia. Steven Gerrard sought to ramp up Saudi Pro League interest in Mane after taking over at Al Ettifaq, but 90min understands he has now quickly reached an agreement in principle on personal terms with Cristiano Ronaldo's Al Nassr. feed The move comes as a major U-turn, with Mane stressing that he would not consider a move to Saudi Arabia even as recently as a fortnight ago.

Fulham set Aleksandar Mitrovic valuation in attempt to stave off Saudi Arabia interest,"Jul 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/fulham-aleksandar-mitrovic-valuation-attempt-stave-off-saudi-arabia-interest,"Fulham are standing firm over Aleksandar Mitrovic's valuation and will not consider selling him for less than what they consider his market value, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Cottagers have rejected two offers from Saudi Pro League outfit Al Hilal, with the second coming in at around Â£30m. Fulham rejected both approaches out of hand, despite Mitrovic making it clear to them that he wants the chance to explore the opportunity of a move to Saudi Arabia.

The Serbia international scored 14 Premier League goals last season, having bagged a record breaking 43 in the Championship the year before. Mitrovic also has three years left on his current deal, which has led them to this figure in excess of Â£60m. As it stands, Al Hilal are ready to return with another offer, but it is not expected to be anywhere near the figure Fulham would consider. Mitrovic, although unhappy, has travelled with the first-team squad for their pre-season tour. feed It has been reported elsewhere that Mitrovic has told his camp he does not want to play for the club again, but it remains to be seen if that will be the case.

It's certainly not just Sao Paulo where the best Brazilian talent hails from, though. The South American country has developed some of the most incredible footballers the world has ever seen and there is little sign that trend is going to stop. Every top club in Europe has scouts dedicated to spotting the best talent in Brazil. Vinicius Junior is the poster boy right now but there are so many who went before him and more who will come after. The next two are set to be Endrick and Vitor Roque, who will join Real Madrid and Barcelona respectively in the summer of 2024. Here are five players still in Brazil who could find themselves heading to Europe in big deals in the near future. The speed with which European teams snap up Brazilian talent these days makes it very hard to know who will go next, but Victor Hugo's time in Brazil will surely soon be over.The 19-year-old is a central midfielder who has already made 60 appearances for Flamengo's first team. He has grabbed five goals in that time, earning links to Real Madrid, Barcelona and Newcastle.Expect his name to feature in the headlines in the next few months. Sticking with Flamengo, there is very rarely just one talented young player in their squad at any given moment. 19-year-old right winger Matheus Franca has already played 54 times for Flamengo and scored nine times.Chelsea have been touted as his most likely destination and he has earned comparisons to Vinicius Junior given he occupies the same position.He is rated at around Â£21m and would increase the contingent of young Brazilians at Stamford Bridge with Angelo Gabriel recently signing from Santos. manual Marcos Leonardo is a 20-year-old striker who has developed at Santos and could soon be in line for his big move to Europe. You can tell there's hype because there are plenty of YouTube compilations of him.Leonardo already has an incredible amount of experience for his age, scoring 44 times alongside 11 assists in 146 appearances for Santos.Lazio have seemed the most interested club in Europe, but it is not yet clear where he may end up."

A summer transfer remains a possibility but would require a drastic shift, with no European clubs currently prepared to match the finances on offer from Saudi Arabia. feed Manager Mikel Arteta is happy to keep Partey in his squad going forward and has welcomed the 30-year-old back into the fold. Also re-joining the Arsenal squad is 22-year-old midfielder Emile Smith Rowe, who was granted extra time off after helping fire England to glory at the European Under-21 Championship this summer. Neither player is expected to play any part in the upcoming friendly against the MLS All-Stars and may even be kept out of the meeting with Manchester United that follows on July 22 as they seek to build their fitness. Arsenal will end their tour of the United States against Barcelona on July 26."
Riyad Mahrez: Al Ahli agree fee for Man City winger,"Jul 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/riyad-mahrez-al-ahli-agree-fee-man-city-winger,"Manchester City have accepted a bid from Saudi Arabian side Al Ahli for winger Riyad Mahrez, 90min understands. A Â£45m-a-year contract has been offered to Mahrez, whose interest was piqued earlier this summer, and the Algeria international spoke with Pep Guardiola recently to confirm his desire to leave the club and head to the Middle East. Guardiola, while reluctant to lose Mahrez, has a policy of never blocking an exit for an unhappy player and the manager made it clear to City's decision-makers that they should listen to offers from Al Ahli. A fee of around Â£30m has now been agreed between the two clubs, with Mahrez due to fly to Saudi Arabia for a medical ahead of putting pen to paper on a contract. Should all go to plan, Mahrez will become Al Ahli's third blockbuster signing of the summer. The Saudi side signed Roberto Firmino on a free transfer after his Liverpool contract expired and later struck a deal to sign goalkeeper Edouard Mendy from Chelsea. feed City are now looking for a replacement for Mahrez and had been among the suitors of Brazilian international Malcom, who is also heading out to Saudi Arabia to join Al Hilal. There has also been a renewed effort from City to keep unsettled midfielder Bernardo Silva. The Portugal international, like Mahrez, has asked to leave the club this summer, and while City have begrudgingly put an asking price of around Â£75m on his head, they do not want to lose the 28-year-old. Barcelona are keen to lure Silva over to Camp Nou, but Paris Saint-Germain are all known admirers of the midfielder. Silva also has his own interest from Saudi Arabia."

A club statement from PSG on the move reads: ""After a season with PSV Eindhoven, Xavi Simons has returned to Paris Saint-Germain until 2027. The Dutch attacking midfielder will be loaned out to German club RB Leipzig for the 2023-2024 season."" feed Speaking to RB Leipzig's official channels after signing on loan, Simons expressed his excitement at playing in the Bundesliga: ""The Bundesliga is one of the best leagues in Europe and RB Leipzig are one of the best teams in the Bundesliga.

"Juventus chief admits Bayern, Chelsea & PSG target Dusan Vlahovic may be sold","Jul 19, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/juventus-bayern-chelsea-psg-dusan-vlahovic-sold,"Juventus sporting director, Cristiano Giuntol admits Dusan Vlahovic may need to be sold to balance the club's books, with the Serbian courting interest from Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain. The 23-year-old has been tipped to leave Turin this summer following a disappointing 2022/23 campaign under manager Massimiliano Allegri in which he scored just 10 Serie A goals - a huge drop off from the 21 and 24 he bagged in the campaigns prior. Sources confirmed to 90min in June that the striker had requested to leave Juventus, and that Allegri has given his blessing for the club to move him on. Speaking in his first press conference since being appointed, Giuntoli has hinted that the club are indeed willing to part ways with Vlahovic, saying: âWe have taken information from many clubs, but we are relying on Chiesa, Vlahovic, Chiesa and Milik. However, this doesnât mean Vlahovic and Chiesa will surely stay in Turin beyond the summer.  âItâs not a secret that we must balance the books. âOf course, if there are irrefutable offers, we must think about it. Technically, we strongly rely on him [Vlahovic]. feed âOf course, if there are irrefutable offers, we must think about it. Technically, we strongly rely on him [Vlahovic]. 90min understands that Vlahovic's representatives are confident that an offer will be forthcoming from either Bayern, Chelsea or PSG, all of whom are looking to strengthen their firepower ahead of the new season. All three clubs are maintaining contact with Vlahovic's representatives, though he is not the only transfer target on the club's radars. Bayern have also been weighing up moves for Harry Kane - two bids have already been rejected by Tottenham and a meeting held with Daniel Levy over a potential sale - and Randal Kolo Muani, while PSG have also taken a keen interest in Kane amid uncertainty over Kylian Mbappe's future. Chelsea are also in dire need of a new centre forward having moved Kai Havertz on to London rivals Arsenal this summer. Romelu Lukaku is also expected to bring his Stamford Bridge career to a permanent end, leaving Nicolas Jackson, a Â£35m arrival from Villarreal, and Armando Broja as their only natural options - Christopher Nkunku can play there but may play in the wide areas after joining from RB Leipzig."
Tottenham grant Davinson Sanchez permission to hold Strasbourg & Spartak Moscow talks,"Jul 19, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-grant-davinson-sanchez-permission-strasbourg-spartak-moscow-talks,"Tottenham Hotspur defender Davinson Sanchez is in talks with several sides over a summer transfer, sources have confirmed to 90min. The centre-back is one of a number of players that Spurs are looking to shift before the end of the window, with 90min revealing back in June that Sanchez could be sold. Sanchez is currently with Tottenham's first team on their tour of Australia and Asia, with club captain Hugo Lloris the only senior player left behind to try and seal a move away. But 90min understands the Colombia international is edging closer to the exit door as Spurs have now granted him permission to talk to interested clubs. French side Strasbourg - who were recently purchased by Chelsea owner Todd Boehly - and Russian outfit Spartak Moscow will enter negotiations with Sanchez, while he also has suitors from Germany. feed Sanchez joined Tottenham from Ajax in 2017 for Â£42.5m, which at the time was a club-record fee. He emerged as one of the Premier League's best young defenders in his debut season but has failed to kick on. He was booed off by Tottenham supporters following a poor display in their 3-2 defeat at home to Bournemouth back in April. Nevertheless, Sanchez has made 205 appearances for Spurs and was part of the squad that reached their first-ever Champions League final. Meanwhile, 90min understands that Tottenham intend to loan out 18-year-old defender Ashley Phillips once he completes his Â£3m move from Blackburn Rovers. Spurs are set to beat Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United and Newcastle United to his signature.

The 26-year-old forward has come off a fantastic season in Russia which saw him claim 23 goals and nine assists in just 27 games for Zenit St Petersburg. Malcom made it clear to Zenit that he was keen to move on and his form had attracted interest from a number of clubs, including Paris Saint-Germain, Arsenal and Manchester City. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Malcom was a name being considered by City should they lose Riyad Mahrez to the Saudi Pro League this summer. Bernardo Silva is also wanted by clubs in the Middle East but would prefer a move to Barcelona. feed But Malcom is now ready to leave Europe and seal a deal to Saudi Arabia, with Al Hilal the club brokering terms. They are ready to pay around â¬40m for Malcom - the same amount which Zenit first paid to buy him from Barcelona back in 2019. Malcom is set to double his wages his Saudi Arabia and earn close to Â£350,000-a-week - a figure which would not have been attainable for him in the Premier League or back in Ligue 1.

Chelsea agree deal to sell Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to Marseille,"Jul 19, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-agree-deal-sell-pierre-emerick-aubameyang-marseille,"Chelsea have agreed a deal to sell striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to Marseille on a free transfer, 90min understands. Initial talks between the two clubs earlier this week saw Chelsea request a small fee in exchange for Aubameyang's services, with the Blues also determined to offload the entirety of the striker's sizeable wages. Marseille were not prepared to pay a fee for the 34-year-old, however, forcing Chelsea into making a decision on Aubameyang's future. Chelsea had hoped that Aubameyang would agree to a move to Saudi Arabia, where a transfer fee and full wage packet were on offer, but the 34-year-old rejected the proposal as he has always wanted to remain in Europe. After making it clear that he would be prepared to see out the final year of his contract at Chelsea if he was not allowed to join Marseille this summer, Aubameyang has now been granted a free transfer. feed Aware that they were never likely to recoup a significant fee for Aubameyang, Chelsea have prioritised offloading the striker's entire wage packet which, over the course of the remaining 12 months of his contract, would exceed the sort of transfer fees on offer in Europe. The agreement represents another significant departure for Chelsea, whose mass squad clear-out is nearing its completion. Romelu Lukaku, Hakim Ziyech and Callum Hudson-Odoi were all omitted from Mauricio Pochettino's pre-season squad to allow them to continue talks over summer sales. Chelsea have already sold Kai Havertz, Mason Mount, Mateo Kovacic, Kalidou Koulibaly, Christian Pulisic, Edouard Mendy, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Ethan Ampadu, as well as agreeing to the free departures of Cesar Azpilicueta, Baba Rahman, Tiemoue Bakayoko and now Aubameyang."
Kepa Arrizabalaga becomes Chelsea's longest-serving senior player after latest exit,"Jul 19, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/kepa-arrizabalaga-chelsea-longest-serving-senior-player-after-latest-exit,"Chelsea have confirmed the departure of versatile defender Ethan Ampadu to Leeds United, leaving Kepa Arrizabalaga as their longest-serving player in the senior squad. The Blues' summer exodus has seen long-serving stars like Cesar Azpilicueta, N'Golo Kante and Ruben Loftus-Cheek depart the club and left Ampadu, who joined from Exeter as a teenager in July 2017. Ampadu went on to make 12 senior appearances for Chelsea but has now departed for Leeds on a permanent transfer for a fee of around Â£7m. ""We would like to thank Ethan for his efforts throughout his time at Chelsea. We wish him all the best for the next stage of his career,"" a club statement read. Ampadu's exit now leaves Kepa, who moved to Stamford Bridge, as Chelsea's longest-serving senior player. feed Indeed, Kepa is just one of three players in the current Chelsea squad who appeared for the club before 2020, alongside academy graduates Callum Hudson-Odoi and Reece James. Hudson-Odoi is set to leave this summer as well after being left out of Chelsea's pre-season squad. The winger has been training with the Under-21s and is understood to have attracted interest from across Europe as well as Major League Soccer and in Saudi Arabia. One of the challenges for new manager Mauricio Pochettino is naming a new captain following Kepa's exit. The mass departure of senior players leaves Kepa, Ben Chilwell, Thiago Silva and Raheem Sterling as likely candidates. ""First of all we need to see the squad and I need to know and feel the players and the commitment, the character, the personality, both positives and not so positives. We have many players with experience,"" Pochettino said of his search for a new captain during his first press conference."

We've been working on it for a while and we'll definitely try to get it done as quickly as possible."" feed 90min understands that Spurs will sign Phillips from Blackburn, but the 18-year-old will not be the last centre-back brought in this transfer window. Tottenham have been locked in talks for weeks with Bundesliga duo Tapsoba and Van de Ven. The former is believed to be their top target, but Spurs are hoping to bring Leverkusen's asking price down from â¬50m. Negotiations for Van de Ven, who would instead cost â¬40m from Wolfsburg, are slightly more advanced and the Dutchman is keen on joining Tottenham. Sources have told 90min that Spurs do not expect this centre-back saga to go on for much longer, just as Postecoglou had hoped for. Tottenham have already completed the signings of goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario, midfielder James Maddison and winger Manor Solomon this summer, while Dejan Kulusevski and Pedro Porro's loan moves have been made permanent."

Newcastle confirmed on Tuesday that Saint-Maximin was not involved in their trip to Rangers and Eddie Howe revealed after their 2-1 win at Ibrox that the winger is in talks over a transfer. ""He's in early discussions over a potential move away. That's why he wasn't here,"" Howe said. ""It's doubtful he'll join us on the tour of America. I don't think Maxi necessarily wants to leave, but he may feel it's the right time for him to move. It's difficult for me to speak for him, but he hasn't asked to leave. There's been no issue between him and any of us coaches. We all love him. ""If he does leave, we'd lose him with a very heavy heart. He's someone we love working with, he's a difference-maker, we've really had a strong working relationship, and it'll be sad if he leaves."" feed Newcastle, who so far this summer have only signed AC Milan midfielder Sandro Tonali, are having to contend with Financial Fair Play issues.

Newcastle ideally want to bring in another three or four new faces this window, but they have been struggling to offload a number of their squad players who are taking up a big chunk of the wage budget. This means other players, like Saint-Maximin, need to be sold to fund other deals - in this case, their move for Leicester City's Barnes.

""Player trading is a key part of it - you can't hit it, if you don't trade. We're forced to trade a player this window. If the deal didn't go through, I'd be delighted. It would obviously impact our ability to bring any more players in, and then we potentially might have to sell another player. That's the way that Financial Fair Play has hit us."" Newcastle made a move for Barnes at the start of this month and talks are now progressing. They are looking to finalise a fee of around Â£35m with Leicester and are hopeful that they will seal his signature. West Ham United had been in talks with Barnes and Leicester, but have been unable to come to agreement and now Newcastle are confident they can win the race. Barnes is a player that Howe has wanted for some time, as previously revealed by 90min."

One successful season in Turkey earned Kim an â¬18m move to Napoli and the centre-back is once again on the move after just 12 months, becoming one of the most expensive defenders of all time with this move to Bayern.

Man Utd confirm signing of Jonny Evans on short-term deal,"Jul 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-confirm-signing-of-jonny-evans-on-short-term-deal,"Manchester United have announced they have re-signed academy graduate Jonny Evans on a short-term deal. The 35-year-old had been without a club since leaving Leicester City following the expiration of his contract at the end of the 2022/23 season. Evans has spent pre-season training back at Man Utd, where he played 198 games and won 11 trophies between 2007 and 2015. The club are said to have been eager to build a culture where former players have felt welcomed back. And Man Utd have now confirmed that Evans has signed a short-term contract to allow him to partake in pre-season friendlies, starting against Lyon on Wednesday. feed ""Experienced defender Jonny Evans has signed a short-term deal to enable him to take part in Manchester United's upcoming pre-season games in Edinburgh and San Diego,"" a statement read. ""The Academy graduate had been training with the Under-21s whilst considering his options, following his departure from Leicester City at the end of last season.

Chelsea eye Harry Maguire transfer after Wesley Fofana injury,"Jul 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-eye-harry-maguire-transfer-after-wesley-fofana-injury,"Chelsea are considering a move for Harry Maguire after losing Wesley Fofana to a cruciate ligament injury, 90min understands. With less than a month before the new Premier League season gets underway, Mauricio Pochettino's side have suffered a hammer blow with the news that French centre-back Fofana has undergone 'reconstructive surgery' on his ACL. Fofana is likely to miss the majority of the 2023/24 season as a result and, having already let Kalidou Koulibaly and Cesar Azpilicueta leave the club this summer, the Blues are now quickly assessing defensive options available in the current transfer window.  Sources have told 90min that one of their options is former Manchester United captain Maguire, and Chelsea have made enquiries about the defender's situation at Old Trafford.  The Blues' scouting department have cited Maguire as one of the best options on the market.  feed 90min revealed on Monday that Erik ten Hag has communicated to Maguire that the club are keen to sell him this summer, with the England international recently being stripped of the captain's armband by the Red Devils manager.  Maguire has featured sporadically since Ten Hag took charge last summer, making just eight starts in the Premier League during the 2022/23 season. This lack of game time has, expectedly, cast doubts over the defender's long-term future. The 30-year-old has been considering his options with potential interest from West Ham, Newcastle and Serie A giants Inter and Juventus also on his radar, but a potential move to Stamford Bridge could be his most appealing option this summer.  90min understands that while Manchester United would prefer to sell Maguire outright, they would also consider letting him go out on loan to Stamford Bridge too as Chelsea have the capacity to cover the player's wages in full - something other clubs would be unlikely to be able to offer.

Man Utd close to selling defender to Saudi club Al Nassr,"Jul 19, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-close-selling-defender-al-nassr,"Manchester United are closing in on the sale of left back Alex Telles, who is set to join Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr, 90min understands. The Brazilian, who arrived from Porto in 2020, spent last season out on loan with Sevilla after being told by United manager Erik ten Hag that he did not feature in his long-term plans. United have been looking for a buyer since Telles' loan expired in Spain at the end of last season, with Ten Hag firm in his decision that Telles was free to leave. Al Nassr have progressed with talks in recent hours and it's believed a deal is advanced, with the 30-year-old now set to join up with former United teammate Cristiano Ronaldo. Telles was interested in a return to Brazil, with Flamengo showing interest at one stage, but Al Nassr appear to have won the race having made a better offer. United were hoping to recoup in the region of â¬10m for a player not in their plans, but the deal is believed to be worth around â¬6m. feed Al Nassr have so far this summer signed Marcelo Brozovic from Inter and are closing in on a deal for Seko Fofana, the Lens midfielder who had interest from a number of clubs in Europe. Telles is set to join them in the Saudi Pro League, and becomes the latest big name to move to the league as a whole. Ruben Neves, Kalidou Koulibaly, Edouard Mendy, N'Golo Kante, Roberto Firmino, Sergei Milinkovic-Savic and Karim Benzema have all flocked to the league following Ronaldo's arrival last year, with Al Nassr, Al Ittihad, Al Ahli and Al Hilal all taken over by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund last month. PIF also own Newcastle United. For United, they are working on player sales of unwanted squad members before using whatever funds are raised to reinvest into the squad. Andre Onana is close to joining from Inter and his deal should be made official this week, while Atalanta's Rasmus Hojlund is on their wanted list. To move for Hojlund and to strengthen in other areas, such as central midfield and central defence, transfer funds will need to be raised. Dean Henderson, Eric Bailly, Harry Maguire, Brandon Williams, Fred, Donny van de Beek, Scott McTominay, Anthony Elanga and Anthony Martial are all available for transfer at the right price before the transfer window closes."
Brighton reject Chelsea's Â£70m bid for Moises Caicedo,"Jul 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/brighton-reject-chelsea-70m-bid-for-moises-caicedo,"Chelsea have seen an offer worth Â£70m for Moises Caicedo rejected by Brighton & Hove Albion, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Ecuador international is now the Blues' top midfield target, with the west London side seeking reinforcements in that area after losing N'Golo Kante, Mateo Kovacic, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Mason Mount already this transfer window. They have long admired Caicedo, who is coming off the back of an outstanding breakout season at Brighton, helping them reach Europe for the first time in the club's history. Chelsea have done their due diligence and believe he is the perfect option to bolster their midfield. 90min revealed earlier this month that personal terms are not expected to be an issue as Caicedo is keen on making the move to Stamford Bridge and he has spoken publicly of his desire to join. However, Chelsea have seen a Â£70m bid knocked back by Brighton - an offer which has been deemed 'miles away' from their Â£100m by club sources. feed Brighton believe that Caicedo should fetch a figure in the same realm as the Â£105m that West Ham United received from Arsenal for Declan Rice. The Seagulls insist that there is a possibility Caicedo, who signed a new four-year contract back in March, could yet stay on the south coast this summer. Chelsea will face Brighton in a pre-season friendly in the US on Saturday as part of the Premier League Summer Series. Their clash in Philadelphia will serve as Mauricio Pochettino's first game in charge of the Blues."
"Man City transfers: Gvardiol deal nears as Bernardo Silva, Mahrez and Walker talks go on","Jul 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-city-transfers-gvardiol-bernardo-silva-mahrez-walker,"Manchester City's squad could look rather different by the time they kick off their 2023/24 season, with a number of key first team players potentially heading for the exit door if they get their way. The reigning champions of England and Europe have already lost club captain Ilkay Gundogan on a free transfer to Barcelona, and a desire for new challenges, interspersed with some niggles around game time, could see more follow. Mateo Kovacic has come in through the Etihad Stadium arrivals door, joining from Premier League rivals Chelsea, and is not expected to be the only Croatian to turn up in Manchester this summer. Manchester City are edging ever closer to an agreement with RB Leipzig for defender Josko Gvardiol. 90min previously revealed that talks were continuing between the two clubs, albeit slowly, and they remain in constant communication. Leipzig are seeking to make Gvardiol the most expensive defender in history, asking City for in excess of â¬100m before a deal can be completed. City are prepared to do that but the clubs are still ironing out the exact structure of the deal and when certain payments will be made. The 21-year-old has agreed personal terms with the Premier League champions and is awaiting the all-clear to travel for a medical. feed 90min revealed in June that Bernardo Silva had asked to leave Manchester City in pursuit of a new challenge, some 12 months after he'd initially expressed an interest in moving on. The Portugal international is a player City really want to keep hold of, though they have committed to selling Silva if they receive an offer that matches their valuation of around Â£75m.  The 28-year-old has so far resisted a lucrative approach from the Saudi Pro League and remains reluctant to head to the Middle East, while Paris Saint-Germain remain interested. But 90min understands that Barcelona are still exploring ways to cobble together an acceptable package amid their financial struggles and are in talks with Silva's agent, Jorge Mendes. Franck Kessie could be sold this transfer window, but Barca may need to sell another key name in order to raise enough funds and enable them to launch a bid for Silva. Kyle Walker has already agreed personal terms with Bayern Munich, but he has yet to be given the green light by City to complete a move to the Allianz Arena. The German champions are waiting to hear City's definitive stance before lodging an official bid, and talks will be held between Walker and the Champions League holders this week. He could be even sign a new contract at the club, ending any hope that former club Sheffield United may still have of luring him to Bramall Lane. Riyad Mahrez is another player whose future is up in the air, though his mind appears to be made up in terms of leaving City. The Algerian winger was left hurt at being overlooked for both the FA Cup and Champions League finals at the end of last season, and he has the chance to join Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli on a contract worth Â£45m-a-year. Mahrez is due to meet with Pep Guardiola to discuss his future, with a move to Saudi Arabia only likely to happen if the Spaniard gives his blessing to the move. "
Mikel Arteta hints at more Arsenal signings this summer,"Jul 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/mikel-arteta-hints-more-arsenal-signings-this-summer,"Mikel Arteta has revealed that Arsenal will remain 'alert' to any market opportunities during the remainder of the transfer window.  The Gunners have been one of the most active clubs so far this summer, having spent around Â£215m to secure the services of Kai Havertz from Chelsea, Jurrien Timber from Ajax and, perhaps most notably, England international Declan Rice from West Ham United for a British record fee.  Despite already spending big, speaking to Sky Sports ahead of Arsenal's clash with MLS All-Stars at Audi Field in Washington D.C. on Thursday, manager Arteta hinted that the club may not be done yet. ""Letâs see. Thereâs a lot of time still in the market and a lot of expectations in some of our players as well,"" he said. feed ""Weâll have to see and how things develop in the next couple of weeks. Weâll be alert. Thereâs still time to do things and thereâs still time for exits obviously. Iâm sure things will move."" One departure that is looking increasingly likely is the sale of Folarin Balogun this summer. 90min reported this week that Arsenal have put a Â£50m price tag on the striker amid interest from Inter, Atalanta and LOSC Lille.  In terms of potential additional signings, sources confirmed to 90min last week that club club had opened talks over signing Gremio midfielder Bitello. Arsenal representatives were in attendance at Gremio's game against Bahia last Wednesday to scout the player "
Leon Goretzka makes transfer decision amid Man Utd & Liverpool links,"Jul 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/leon-goretzka-makes-transfer-decision-amid-man-utd-liverpool-links,"Leon Goretzka has informed Bayern Munich that he intends to stay and fight for his place despite increasing speculation over a summer exit, sources have told 90min. Though often seen as a lynchpin of their midfield, Goretzka has failed to start more than 23 games in a Bundesliga season for Bayern since his move from Schalke in 2018 and he was used sparingly by Thomas Tuchel towards the end of their most recent campaign. The Bavarians endured a particularly unimpressive 2022/23 season in which they secured an 11th-straight title on the final day due to a collapse from rivals Borussia Dortmund. Bayern have been looking to bolster their squad with high-profile additions this transfer window, with Kim Min-jae's â¬50m move from Napoli expected to be confirmed shortly and talks ongoing with Tottenham over a deal for Harry Kane, though Spurs have shown little sign of softening their stance that he will stay. feed Goretzka has been one current player tipped to leave Bayern to make way for a fresh wave of stars, but 90min understands he has no desire to leave the Allianz Arena. Bayern had informed Goretzka that he could be sold and his representatives made this known to clubs across Europe, but the midfielder's stance over a move has meant that they are unlikely to receive any forthcoming offers. Liverpool and Manchester United have been linked with Goretzka, and though sources have confirmed to 90min that both have monitored him in the past, they will not advance their interests due to his intentions to stay at Bayern. Reports in Germany this week have touted West Ham with an interest, but like Liverpool and Man Utd will not follow through with an offer while the midfielder is determined to remain in with Bayern. Should Goretzka have a change in heart, 90min understands that several Premier League teams could firm up their interest, but the expectation is he will not leave this window."
Arsenal set Folarin Balogun price tag amid Inter interest,"Jul 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-set-folarin-balogun-price-tag-inter-interest,"Arsenal have slapped a Â£50m price tag on striker Folarin Balogun as Inter begin talks with the player's representatives, 90min understands.  The USMNT international has recently returned to Arsenal following a hugely successful loan spell at Reims in Ligue 1. During his single season in France, the striker netted 21 goals in 37 league outings - a tally bettered by only Kylian Mbappe, Alexandre Lacazette and Jonathan David.  Having rejected the opportunity to sign a new contract at the Gunners upon his return, 90min recently reported that the club have asked the player's representatives to begin talking to interested parties in order to find a buyer.  One team that has emerged as suitors are Inter, who recently walked away from talks over bringing striker Romelu Lukaku back to San Siro on a permanent deal. Folarin Balogun on his potential move away from Arsenal: pic.twitter.com/KgmIwiaBjp The UEFA Champions League finalists have initiated talks with Balogun's representatives in recent days, while fellow Serie A side Atalanta and Ligue 1 outfit LOSC Lille has also enquired - although both teams' interest is dependent upon the potential sales of Rasmus Hojlund (Atalanta) and Jonathan David (Lille) first.  A huge stumbling block that clubs have found with any potential move is Arsenal's asking price. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Mikel Arteta's side are keen to get Â£50m for the 22-year-old, but the player's agents are hoping they can whittle the asking price down to around Â£40m.  Speaking exclusively to 90min at Arsenal's training camp ahead of the clash with MLS All-Stars in Washington DC, the striker insisted that his focused remains on pre-season despite the rampant discussion about his future:  ""I was away for the year, so I'm just back, I'm obviously just focused on pre-season with the team."""
Ilkay Gundogan reveals why he left Man City for Barcelona,"Jul 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ilkay-gundogan-reveals-why-left-man-city-barcelona,"Ilkay Gundogan has admitted that Xavi played a huge role in persuading him to leave Manchester City for Barcelona. The 32-year-old lifted the Champions League in June to complete a famous treble for City, bringing the curtain down on a trophy-laden career at the Etihad Stadium. City had hoped to persuade Gundogan to sign a new one-year contract with the option of a further 12 months, but he opted to take on the challenge of joining Barcelona, who wrestled back the La Liga title from Real Madrid last season. Gundogan was unveiled as a Barcelona player on Monday afternoon, where he provided insight into how a conversation with Xavi convinced him that now was the time to move. ""The first moment we talked to each other, I just felt it was right to come here, join the club and have the opportunity to prove myself at a different club and a different country,"" Gundogan said. ""I was close to coming here two times earlier but it was not meant to be. Now it is the time. ""Xavi made his ideas of how the team wants to play very clear. It's very similar to how we played in Man City. It's a similar school, Guardiola, Xaviâ¦In the way he approached the talks, the honesty from him I saw sort of my own character reflected in him. feed ""It was probably not much of what he said but especially how he said it, which sometimes is more important."" Pep Guardiola had been the driving force behind City's desire to keep Gundogan, after making the German club captain after the departure of Fernandinho in 2022. And their close relationship is why Gundogan made sure that his manager was the first person to be informed of his decision to move on. ""For me, it was important that he was the first to know,"" Gundogan revealed. ""I expressed my gratitude to him, in a way I consider that he was happy and that when I needed anything about the club and about the city I would ask him for advice. âItâs not so much that Pep lacked [anything]. Iâve known him well, for seven years, but I like challenges and constantly surpassing myself. All that the coach and the club have done to convince me, is that my desire to sign for the club has grown a lot.â Gundogan has proven his credentials at City time and time again, but also stressed: ""Itâs an opportunity to show who I am, new team, new country, new city and even though Iâm an age, I still have a lot to show.â"

Transfer notebook: Everton bid for Gnonto; Leicester chase Amad loan,"Jul 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/transfer-notebook-everton-gnonto-leicester-amad-loan,"Everton's attempts to reinforce Sean Dyche's forward options have been blunted by Leeds United turning down an offer for Wilfried Gnonto. The 19-year-old joined Leeds on a five-year deal last September for an undisclosed fee but scored just twice in 24 appearances as a combination of Jesse Marsch, Javi Gracia and Sam Allardyce failed to preserve the club's Premier League status. Gnonto has been generating plenty of interest from Serie A, though it's a bid from Everton, believed to be worth around Â£15m, that has been turned down. A move is not out of the question for Gnonto, who may push to leave Elland Road with a place in Roberto Mancini's Italy squad for Euro 2024 potentially at stake. Leicester City, who joined Leeds in the Championship after a disastrous relegation from the Premier League, are keen to boost their promotion hopes with the loan signings of Amad Diallo and Cesare Casadei. 21-year-old Amad spent last season on loan at Sunderland, scoring 13 goals in 37 Championship appearances to fire the Black Cats into the mix for promotion. Amad and Sunderland ultimately came up short, but his form in red and white has attracted the attention of new Leicester boss Enzo Maresca. He's looking for additional ammunition at King Power Stadium after losing James Maddison to Tottenham, while Harvey Barnes is also expected to return to the Premier League. As for Casedei, he's gone on Chelsea's pre-season tour after spending the second half of the 2022/23 season on loan at Reading, but is expected to depart for more experience. The 20-year-old is a defensive-minded midfielder who arrived at Stamford Bridge from Inter on a six-year contract. Bournemouth hope to back up their lofty ambitions with the signings of Bristol City midfielder Alex Scott and AZ Alkmaar wing-back Milos Kerkez. The Cherries surprised many onlookers by comfortably staving off relegation last season, only to then replace Gary O'Neil as manager with Rayo Vallecano boss Andoni Iraola. Hamed Traore and Justin Kluivert have already joined Bournemouth on permanent deals and there's hope a deal can be struck for emerging midfielder Scott. Wolves also like the 19-year-old, who is valued at around Â£25m. Kerkez is another prominent teenager to have caught the eye at AZ Alkmaar and is now primed to join Bournemouth ahead of Lazio, despite their return to Champions League competition. Brighton and Fulham are going head-to-head for Fiorentina centre-back Igor, who featured prominently in the club's run to last season's Europa Conference League final. The 25-year-old has already been the subject of a rejected bid from the Cottagers, which could allow Brighton to step in if they're able to agree a fee with Fiorentina. The Seagulls are in the market for a left-footed centre-back having missed out on Levi Colwill on a permanent basis and have also been tracking Ajax's Calvin Bassey in addition to Igor. Leeds are finalising the finer details of a deal for Chelsea's Ethan Ampadu, seeing off interest from the likes of Sheffield United, Burnley, Fulham, West Brom and Coventry in the process. The 22-year-old has spent the last two seasons on loan in Serie A - at Venezia and Spezia respectively - having already spent time at Sheffield United and RB Leipzig. A permanent Â£7m move is now in the offing, ending a Chelsea career that has offered up just one Premier League appearance. Leeds are also set to reunite new manager Daniel Farke with versatile full-back Sam Byram, who is available on a free transfer following the expiry of his Norwich contract."

Villa's first bid for the France international, which was worth Â£30m, was rejected by the German outfit, who are understood to value Diaby closer to Â£51m. Talks between the two teams have continued and Unai Emery's side have now made a new proposal of around Â£43m, which would represent a club record deal for the Birmingham giants. 24-year-old Diaby has two years left on his current deal in Germany, but 90min has been told his representatives have made it clear to Leverkusen he is ready to leave the Bundesliga and a move to the Premier League has long been on his radar. feed Villa are determined to bolster their attacking options and Diaby is their main target at this point, although they are not the only interested party. Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr are willing to match Villa's offer for Diaby, but sources close to the player have told 90min a move to England would be his preferred option.

Jurrien Timber reveals why Arsenal signed him,"Jul 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jurrien-timber-reveals-why-arsenal-signed-him,"Jurrien Timber has revealed his ability to play Arsenal's style of football is the reason the Gunners signed him this summer. Arsenal announced the Â£40m signing of Timber from Ajax at the end of last week, ending the Dutchman's near decade-long association with de Godenzonen at both youth and senior level. The defender is one of three major signings Mikel Arteta's side have made this summer thus far, also forking out Â£65m to sign Kai Havertz from Chelsea and a British record transfer fee to secure the services of Declan Rice from West Ham. Speaking to the club's official website about why Arsenal decided to sign him, Timber pointed to the similar tactics he enjoyed at Ajax as key to making the move. He said: ""I can see a lot of similarities, especially in the way Arsenal and Ajax want to play. Of course, this is a bigger league and everything is bigger here, I can see that immediately. This is the way they teach you in the youth already, and I'm happy I got to learn that at Ajax. feed ""I think also that's the reason they bought me and they want me, because they know I can play this style. And now it's for me to show everyone and also in the Premier League that I can do the same things."" Arteta also spoke to the club's channels after the move was finalised, hailing Timber's versatility as a reason Arsenal signed the Dutch international: ""We're really excited that Jurrien has joined us. He is a versatile young defender, who will fit into our system and provide our squad with so much added quality. ""Jurrien is a young player, but has already achieved so much. He has experienced what it's like to go to a major international tournament on more than one occasion, as well as the trophies he has won with Ajax. We look forward to welcoming and integrating Jurrien into the squad."""
Folarin Balogun responds to Arsenal exit speculation & future MLS transfer,"Jul 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/folarin-balogun-responds-arsenal-exit-speculation-future-mls-transfer,"Folarin Balogun says that he's leaving the speculation and talk over his Arsenal future to his agent and family. The 22-year-old has returned to north London after a hugely successful loan spell at Stade Reims yielded 21 goals in 37 Ligue 1 appearances last season. Balogun had previously spent time away from Arsenal on loan at Middlesbrough, where he wasn't as successful in terms of goals, but now returns to the club as a full international after recently making his debut for the United States - he's off the goalscoring mark too after netting in the Nations League final win over Canada earlier in the summer. 90min previously revealed that Arsenal had instructed Balogun's representatives to step up the search for a new club, after his camp again rejected the opportunity to negotiate a new contract, and he has stated publicly that he has no intention of being loaned out again. Inter are among a number of sides interested in signing Balogun, who looks destined to leave the Emirates Stadium unless he can impress Mikel Arteta in pre-season - something he insists he's currently focused on. Folarin Balogun on his potential move away from Arsenal: pic.twitter.com/KgmIwiaBjp feed ""I was away for the year, so I'm just back, I'm obviously just focused on pre-season with the team,"" Balogun told 90min, taking time away from Arsenal's training camp ahead of Thursday's game with MLS All-Stars. ""I'm really just focused here and of course my agent and my family are dealing with this."" Balogun's switch of international allegiance was warmly received by fans in the United States, who will have been fully aware of his goalscoring exploits during 2022/23 and his past appearances for England at various youth levels. But in terms of playing his club football in MLS, that appears to be a bridge too far for Balogun as he prepares to make a name for himself in one of Europe's top five leagues."
Youssouf Fofana on extensive West Ham target list as initial Joao Palhinha bid fails,"Jul 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/youssouf-fofana-west-ham-target-joao-palhinha-bid-fails,"West Ham have failed with an initial move for Fulham midfielder Joao Palhinha, 90min understands, but have an extensive target list that includes Monaco's Youssouf Fofana. The Hammers officially bid farewell to captain Declan Rice on Saturday, with Arsenal completing a British-record Â£105m move for the 24-year-old after weeks of intense speculation. Rice's departure leaves Tomas Soucek and Flynn Downes as David Moyes' only real defensive-minded midfield options - the latter played just 762 minutes of Premier League football last season, starting just seven times - while Lucas Paqueta and Pablo Fornals are two other options who can play centrally but thrive in the final third. West Ham have been preparing for Rice's exit for some time, knowing their former captain needed to be sold this summer in order to extract maximum value, and 90min recently revealed that Juventus midfielder Denis Zakaria is one player West Ham are interested in taking to London Stadium on loan with a potential option to buy. The Swiss international remains a concrete target for West Ham,  who appointed Tim Steidten as their new technical director at the beginning of July, but the club have an extensive number of players on their transfer shortlist - some who are players long admired by manager David Moyes, and others brought to the table by Steidten. Sources have confirmed to 90min that an initial approach for Fulham midfielder Joao Palhinha has been rejected - a player West Ham first showed interest in prior to Steidten's arrival - and it remains to be seen whether or not a follow-up approach will be made. Fulham are understood to value 28-year-old Palhinha at Â£80m, which would represent a significant profit on the Â£17.5m they paid Sporting CP for the Portuguese international less than a year ago. That figure is considered to be too high by West Ham, though there's a feeling that a deal is there to be done should the Hammers decide to stump a package worth Â£60m. Youssouf Fofana of Monaco is also emerging as a player of significant interest to West Ham. The 24-year-old, who made his international debut for France last year and played in six of Les Bleus' seven games at the 2022 World Cup, has significant experience of playing in the Europa League and early stages of the Champions League, and could represent far better value for money should West Ham look to exploit Steidten's knowledge of the European market. feed There's also a strong interest in Manchester United's Scott McTominay and Southampton's James Ward-Prowse, who are both players that Moyes has been a fan of for a number of years. The former is a bit-part player under Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford, while the latter endured relegation from the Premier League last season and could be available for a reduced fee. West Ham are also still progressing a move for Ajax's Edson Alvarez, who 90min recently revealed will not be joining Borussia Dortmund as planned. The Mexican international is valued at around Â£40m by the Eredivisie giants, and was previously linked with moves to Man Utd and Chelsea. Kalvin Phillips remains in the frame too, despite his apparent willingness to stay and fight for his place at Manchester City. The 27-year-old started just two Premier League games for the champions last season, and may be tempted by the offer of regular football at West Ham as he bids to be a part of Gareth Southgate's England squad for Euro 2024. Tyler Adams has also been offered to West Ham following Leeds' relegation, but there's no suggestion at this stage that the American international will be making his way to the capital."
Atalanta coach admits deadline on Man Utd's Rasmus Hojlund talks is unlikely,"Jul 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/atalanta-coach-admits-deadline-man-utd-rasmus-hojlund-talks-unlikely,"Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini has admitted it is impossible to put a deadline on Manchester Unitedâs pursuit of striker Rasmus Hojlund because an offer for the 20-year-old that is too good to turn down could feasibly come at any time until the transfer window closes. Manchester United are in the market for a new 'number nine' this summer and are making more progress with Hojlund, who offers long-term potential in the position, than much more expensive readymade players of interest like Harry Kane or Victor Osimhen. Hojlund has played fewer than 100 senior games in his career. On the surface, his nine goals in Serie A last season doesn't automatically suggest the kind of transfer fee being talked about. But it's worth noting that he was a teenager for more than half the campaign and that he was sharing minutes with more senior forwards that limited him to only 20 league starts. He also has six in six for Denmark. As 90min previously reported, United's first two offers for Hojlund have been rejected by Atalanta, who are holding out for up to â¬80m (Â£69m). Old Trafford officials are not willing to be held to ransom in the negotiations and arenât willing to go much higher than â¬60m (Â£51.5m). Hojlund wants to make the move and has openly stated in the past that he is a United fan. Now, 90min understands that talks between United and Atalanta over Hojlund are continuing, although at this stage the crucial breakthrough regarding an agreement is not very close. feed Clubs will often try and fix their own arbitrary deadlines during transfer negotiations, usually to get deals completed sooner rather than later to allow them to go back into the market â United have experienced in the past when talking to Borussia Dortmund about Jadon Sancho. But Gasperini has admitted Atalanta resorting to such tactics is pretty pointless. The transfer window for Premier League clubs to buy is open until 1 September, which potentially leaves a question over Hojlundâs future after the Serie A season begins on 20 August if a sale has not been agreed prior to that. Indeed when Atalanta signed the player themselves from Sturm Graz last summer, it was in the finals days of the transfer window after the season had begun. ""Even if we fix a date, 15 August, the transfer market isn't over,"" Gasperini said, via Italy24. ""If an offer [that is too good to refuse] arrives, the club, the player, decides later,"" he added. ""Deadline? I would put 31 July, but realistically there is no possibility, even HÃ¸jlund was like this last year. Everything is random."""
Chelsea lay out Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang demands as Marseille hold talks,"Jul 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-lay-out-pierre-emerick-aubameyang-demands-marseille-talks,"Chelsea have informed suitors of striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang that they do not want to let him leave on a free transfer this summer, 90min understands, with Marseille the latest side to reach out over a deal. A Â£12m signing from Barcelona last summer, Aubameyang managed 21 appearances for the Blues in his first season at Stamford Bridge but saw himself frozen out of the squad by both Graham Potter and Frank Lampard. Both Chelsea and Aubameyang are keen to part ways this summer and the Gabon international was among the first players to be offered to Saudi Arabia, where an offer for Aubameyang, who will not travel with the Blues for pre-season, still remains on the table. 90min understands that the latest side to express an interest in the 34-year-old is Ligue 1 side Marseille, who have been informed that they must pay a fee and agree to take over Aubameyang's entire wage package. Such a proposal could be difficult for Marseille to meet but the French side hope their ability to offer Champions League football to Aubameyang could help them sweeten a deal. feed Clubs in Saudi Arabia are prepared to meet the demands of both Chelsea and Aubameyang but the striker is hesitant to accept a move to the Middle East in the hope that a top European side could offer him a deal. Former employers Barcelona are known admirers of Aubameyang but have far greater priorities for the summer window, particularly after the â¬60m deal to sign Athletico Paranaense striker Vitor Roque was agreed. Aubameyang was even in the Barcelona dressing room to celebrate their Clasico victory over Real Madrid in March as a signal of his desire to return to the club, but a move back to Camp Nou appears unlikely. The striker's representatives continue to explore their options and will seek to close a deal while Mauricio Pochettino and the rest of the Chelsea first team are in the United States for their pre-season tour. Romelu Lukaku is also due back at Cobham after Chelsea's departure and, like Aubameyang, is up for sale this summer."
Gerard Pique hails new Barcelona signing,"Jul 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/gerard-pique-hails-new-barcelona-signing,"Gerard Pique has spoken highly of new Barcelona defender Inigo Martinez, particularly hailing the player's 'character'.  Martinez joined Barcelona as a free agent at the start of July, signing a two-year deal at Camp Nou following a hugely successful stint at Athletic Club. The 32-year-old comes to Barc with a wealth of La Liga experience, having played over 350 games for both Athletic Club and Real Sociedad.  Speaking to EFE, legendary Barca defender Pique gave his thoughts on the signing, hailing the player's ability on the ball and his character. ""I coincided with him in the Spanish national team on some occasions, and he is a great player who has been in La Liga for years. He has played for both Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao, two great clubs in Spain, and he has a lot of experience,"" Pique explained. feed ""He handles the ball very well, he has a great foot and a lot of character. ""With him, the centre-back position is going to be even more competitive because Ronald Araujo is there, Christensen is there, and Jules Kounde can also play there. The team already showed last season that defensively they can compete at a high level, and we hope it continues that way."" Martinez is one of three signings that La Blaugrana have made so far this summer, with Ilkay Gundogan also signing as a free agent following the expiration of his contract at Manchester City and the club recently confirming Brazilian prodigy Vitor Roque - who will not arrive until 2024.

Now out in Perth for Tottenham's pre-season tour of Australia, Son has once again shot down reports linking him with a move to Saudi Arabia. ""If I wanted to go there I would be out there, not here,"" he told a press conference.  ""I love playing football, obviously money is also important.

Barcelona target misses training to undergo medical ahead of summer transfer,"Jul 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-target-misses-training-medical-transfer-oriol-romeu,"Girona midfielder Oriol Romeu is not training with the team on Monday after being given permission to head to Barcelona for a medical ahead of securing a transfer to Camp Nou. Barcelona want a new midfielder to replace departed captain Sergio Busquets and have set their sights on Romeu, a former La Masia gem, to fill the void. Talks between the two Catalan sides have been ongoing for weeks and numerous reports in Spain suggest an agreement has now been reached, with Barcelona expected to pay around â¬5m plus add-ons for the 31-year-old. To sweeten the deal, Barcelona are also expected to send young midfielder Pablo Torre on loan to Girona. Gerard Romero states that Romeu has been excused from training and has travelled to Barcelona's training ground to undergo a medical and put pen to paper on a contract. feed Should all go according to plan, Romeu is expected to become Barcelona's third signing of the summer, following Ilkay Gundogan and Inigo Martinez in sealing moves to Camp Nou. Romeu left Barcelona for Chelsea in 2011 having shone for the B team and managed two senior appearances, both of which came during the 2010/11 season under Pep Guardiola. His only La Liga appearance came as a substitute against Deportivo La Coruna towards the end of the campaign, with Romeu initially named on the bench alongside current Blaugrana boss Xavi, who went unused. Barcelona president Joan Laporta has confirmed there are plans to sign a second midfielder alongside Romeu, and a new right-back is also high on Xavi's wish list."
Romelu Lukaku: Roc Nation president speaks out on collapse of Inter transfer,"Jul 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/romelu-lukaku-roc-nation-president-collapse-inter-transfer,"The president of Roc Nation, the agency of Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku, appears to have shut down rumours they could cut ties with the Belgian after his summer transfer to Inter collapsed. After months of pushing to sign Lukaku, Inter abandoned their pursuit of the 30-year-old over the weekend after learning that he had spoken with Juventus about a possible transfer - despite Lukaku himself insisting Inter were his only option. The chaotic situation led to reports in Italy suggesting Roc Nation were so furious with Lukaku's conduct that they could tear up his contract with the agency. However, Roc Nation president Michael Yormark now appears to have shot such speculation down. ""Fake news and irresponsible reporting must stop,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""Focus on facts and the truth."" feed The collapse of his move to Inter saw fans with long memories dig out Lukaku's previous quotes on a possible move to Juventus from back in 2021. ""If Juventus or AC Milan will call me in the future? Never, never,"" the striker said previously. ""Again, never. It's never going to happen. ""Juventus wanted me before Inter, but when [Antonio] Conte joined Inter it was my priority to join them. In Italy, there's only Inter for me."" It's for that reason that Inter have been left so frustrated with Lukaku, who is now expected to report back for pre-season training with Chelsea this week. The Blues jet off to the United States for their pre-season tour on Monday plan to do so without Lukaku, with manager Mauricio Pochettino happy to move on from the Belgian and leave the recruitment chiefs to find a solution. Juventus remain keen on a deal if they can offload Dusan Vlahovic, while an offer from Saudi Arabia remains on the table."
Erik ten Hag informs Harry Maguire he can leave Manchester United,"Jul 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/erik-ten-hag-harry-maguire-leave-manchester-united,"Erik ten Hag has communicated to Harry Maguire that it would be better for all involved if he were to complete a transfer away from Manchester United this summer, 90min understands. Maguire, the now former United captain, confirmed on Sunday in a social media post that he had been stripped of the armband in a conversation with the manager, who outlined his reasons why in a meeting between the two. But it has been learned that there was more to the meeting than Maguire had publicly let on - with his departure not only green-lit, but encouraged. Bruno Fernandes is expected to succeed Maguire as captain but there has been no official confirmation as yet. Ten Hag transitioned Maguire out of his first choice United eleven over the course of last season and Raphael Varane, Lisandro Martinez, Victor Lindelof and even Luke Shaw have been established higher up in the pecking order of United centre backs in recent months. Maguire retained the armband when on the pitch throughout last season though saw minutes hard to come by. United have put Maguire up for sale for the right price throughout the summer, but Maguire has been keen to stay and fight for his place in the squad. The latest conversation between Maguire and Ten Hag, it has been learned, is a move from the club to guide the 30-year-old through the exit door - in hope it will change Maguire's stance of wanting to stay. The England international has interest from a number of clubs in Italy, as well as West Ham and Newcastle United, though his world record transfer fee for a defender and large earnings make the player difficult to offload.  United are aware that a loan deal is more likely because of the wage packet and any transfer away is likely to mean United will need to subsidise a part of the figure until the end of his contract in 2025. feed 90min revealed in April that Maguire's camp were working on exit routes from Old Trafford for the player and that remains the case, though Premier League rivals are pushing for good value deals as it stands - safe in the knowledge that United are looking to offload. Ten Hag is set to feature Maguire in match day squads and offer a rotational role if United can't offload the player and he is to stay, but United are looking to raise funds in order to reinvest and see Maguire as a primary candidate to leave due to his diminished status. Maguire's unwillingness to depart has already impacted United's pursuit of Kim Min-jae, the Napoli centre back who is set to join German champions Bayern Munich instead, but United are keen to press on with as much of their proposed squad overhaul as they can manage throughout this window. Ten Hag used last season to learn the players he wants to take forward with him and Maguire is one of several first team squad players who is up for sale. If they do manage to successfully offload Maguire, United may enter the market for a new centre back, but as it stands and with Maguire present, they have enough cover in the position. Next on the agenda is a new striker and defensive-minded midfielder. The club have already signed Mason Mount and Inter's Andre Onana is set to complete his United move before they fly to the United States this week."

Postecoglou, who met Kane for the first time last week, was asked about the talisman's future during a press conference at Spurs' training camp in Perth, and the new boss revealed the details of the talks. ""I had a good chat with Harry,"" Postecoglou began. ""It was nothing earth-shattering as people are seeking. Just a good chat, introduced myself, and we spoke mainly about the club, where it's at and where he thinks can improve. feed ""It's not a specific vision for one person, it's about the group and we're perfectly aligned on that - we want to see a successful team this year. ""There are a lot of people who know Harry better than me, but he's not going to get phased by anything. He's here and while he's here, he's totally committed to what we're doing, and that's the way I've seen things. ""The discussion wasn't really about [the future], it was more about the collective and what we're doing. Harry's the same as all the other players, it's not something I ask when they walk through the door, asking have you got a ticket or not. ""It's about working hard as a group as we go along, some will be on for the whole journey, others won't, but a lot of that gets decided along the way. It's not something I'm demanding from people right at the outset. ""We've got nearly a month until the season starts, the transfer window's still open, so we'll see what transpires."""

Man Utd reach â¬55m agreement with Inter to sign Andre Onana,"Jul 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-reach-agreement-inter-sign-andre-onana,"Manchester United have reached an agreement with Inter for the transfer of goalkeeper Andre Onana, 90min understands. The Cameroon international has been established as United's first choice goalkeeping target and long-term successor to David de Gea, who saw his contract expire and left the club earlier this month. United have been in discussions with Inter over recent days to come to a deal over the transfer of the 27-year-old. Inter had been holding out for â¬60m and had knocked back two offers from United for Onana, but a deal has now been reached after further talks. It's understood United have committed to paying â¬55m inclusive of add-ons to secure Onana's services. The add-ons themselves are worth â¬4m of that fee. United have already agreed personal terms with Onana, who has previously worked with United manager Erik ten Hag at Ajax, and Onana will undergo a medical before signing what is understood to be a five-year contract with an option for a further year. feed Onana is set to earn a base salary of around Â£120,000-a-week, with bonuses and appearance fees taking it to within the region of Â£150,000. It is a substantial decrease for a United number one goalkeeper in comparison to De Gea's wages - with the Spaniard earning in the region of Â£375,000 a week across his last contract. The deal is structured in a similar manner to those of Lisandro Martinez and Antony, who both arrived last summer, and is set to increase to closer to Â£200,000 a week as the deal progresses. United have been conscious to reduce the wages they are offering even to first team players in recent transfer windows, with existing contracts for Harry Maguire and Aaron Wan-Bissaka so substantial United have found it difficult to move the players on. Onana has been established as United's top priority in goal in recent weeks, after the club pivoted away from extending the contract of De Gea due to a drop off in performances in the final months of last season. Ten Hag has been behind the decision and wants to see United improve their ability to distribute from the goalkeeper - a key quality in Onana's game. United are also in the market for a second goalkeeper to become Onana's understudy. The deal for Onana being reached unlocks the door for Dean Henderson to move to Nottingham Forest in a deal which could be worth around Â£20m. Tom Heaton is also attracting interest from the likes of Everton and Luton Town."

Eddie Howe reveals Newcastle's stance on signing Saudi Pro League players on loan,"Jul 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/eddie-howe-newcastle-stance-signing-saudi-pro-league-players-loan,"Manager Eddie Howe says Newcastle could sign players from the Saudi Pro League on loan if the prospective deal was right for the club. The Magpies are owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, who recently took majority control of Al Nassr, Al Hilal, Al Ittihad and Al Ahli. Players like Roberto Firmino, Edouard Mendy, Ruben Neves, Karim Benzema, N'Golo Kante and Cristiano Ronaldo are among the many to have left European football in favour of resettling in the Middle East this summer. Fears that Newcastle could dip into that market of players in the future have been raised and Howe revealed such loan deals could happen. He said: ""That depends on if it is the right thing for Newcastle. We'll always act with our best interests first. ""I don't think the fees have been excessive necessarily - maybe the wages have, which is making it attractive to players."" feed Newcastle still have work to do this window. Sandro Tonali arrived from AC Milan as their first major signing, having also brought in Yankuba Minteh from Danish side Odense Boldklub before sending him to Feyenoord on loan. James Maddison was a target before Spurs swooped in, while interest has been registered in Chelsea duo Conor Gallagher and Trevoh Chalobah. Talks have also been held with Leicester for winger Harvey Barnes, who could replace Allan Saint-Maximin if the Frenchman departs with Saudi interest brewing. ""I'm a mixture of all things at different times,"" Howe responded when asked if the window had been calm or frustrating so far.  ""I'm patient and understand the parameters we're working in but I also know the needs we have. ""For me it's not a case of we want to do it, we need to do it. And being a coach I want them on the grass available now, so all of those things together."""
Mikel Arteta explains why Arsenal agreed Granit Xhaka exit,"Jul 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/mikel-arteta-explains-why-arsenal-agreed-granit-xhaka-exit,"Mikel Arteta says Granit Xhaka's exit from Arsenal was amicable after the midfielder showed a 'clear desire' to move to Bayer Leverkusen. The Switzerland international enjoyed arguably his best Gunners season in 2022/23, having previously endured a love-hate relationship with the club's fans. Xhaka contributed seven goals and seven assists in the Premier League last term as they finished second and sealed a return to the Champions League, but Xhaka backed away from contract talks in May in a major hint that his north London career was coming to an end. The 30-year-old revealed he was won over by Bayer Leverkusen's long-term project under manager Xabi Alonso and sporting director Simon Rolfes after signing for the German side. Arteta has now backed up that account. Speaking after Arsenal's first pre-season friendly of the summer - a 1-1 draw with Nurnberg - Arteta said: ""There are three parts to this. He had a clear desire that it was the right time and that it was a big, big opportunity for him personally to move there. ""We had that conversation and at the end we all agreed that it was the right thing to move forward."" feed Xhaka joins a Leverkusen side that rallied during April and May to finish sixth and qualify for the Europa League, having been as low as 12th at the start of 2023. The former Borussia Monchengladbach star won two FA Cups with Arsenal during his seven-season stay at the Emirates, scoring 23 goals in 297 appearances. The impact of his departure has been majorly softened by the club record arrival of Declan Rice from West Ham, while defender Jurrien Timber's move has also been confirmed. Kai Havertz was the Gunners' first signing of the summer in late June."
PSV confirm Xavi Simons imminent return to Paris Saint-Germain,"Jul 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psv-confirm-xavi-simons-imminent-return-paris-saint-germain,"PSV Eindhoven have confirmed Xavi Simons has left their training camp to close in on a return to Paris Saint-Germain. The Netherlands international first joined PSG in 2019 after leaving Barcelona before departing for PSV in 2022. A buy-back clause worth around â¬10m and â¬12m was included in the deal and PSG have now activated it. A statement from PSV, who came second in the 2022/23 Eredivisie, reads: ""Xavi Simons immediately leaves the training camp to complete the transfer with Paris Saint Germain.Â The twenty-year-old attacker came to PSV last year and became an important player in Ruud van Nistelrooy's team."" feed Simons netted 19 league goals last season alongside eight assists and made his debut for the Dutch national team in 2022, featuring once at the World Cup during a knockout stage victory over the United States. He featured 11 times in total for PSG the first time around but will be a more prominent squad member once the transfer goes through. Luis Enrique is the new manager in charge at Parc des Princes and is having to navigate a typically chaotic transfer window with the futures of Kylian Mbappe and Neymar up in the air. However, strong signings in the form of Milan Skriniar, Marco Asensio, Manuel Ugarte, Lee Kang-in and Lucas Hernandez have been made to bolster the Spaniard's squad. Enrique was in charge at Barcelona from 2014 to 2017, when Simons was a youth prospect at Camp Nou gaining legions on followers on Instagram."
Ilkay Gundogan reveals why he chose to join Barcelona,"Jul 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ilkay-gundogan-reveals-why-he-chose-to-join-barcelona,"Barcelona midfielder Ilkay Gundogan has revealed he already has a 'great connection' with coach Xavi ahead of his official unveiling at Camp Nou on Monday. BarÃ§a announced a deal had been struck with Gundogan just over two weeks after he lifted the Champions League trophy with Manchester City. The 32-year-old has been away on holiday following international duty with Germany at the start of June and touched down in Barcelona on Saturday night ready to start his new chapter. Despite growing up in Germany, Gundogan considers himself a fan of the club because of how he was drawn as a teenager to the great Barcelona teams led by Frank Rijkaard and Pep Guardiola. ""I remember when I was a child and I sawÂ RijkaardÂ andÂ Pep's BarÃ§a. I'm a BarÃ§a fan, I've always followed them closely every seasonÂ and I am very happy and very proud to be part of this team,"" the former Borussia Dortmund star said, via Mundo Deportivo. feed Gundogan joins a Barcelona team that won La Liga last season for the first time in four years, with the club getting on back to its feet in a footballing sense under Xavi, even if the off-field financial situation still remain a more general concern. ""I expect good football,"" Gundogan said. ""I think there is a lot of potential in the team with very young playersÂ and I think that with my experience I can help them reach their next level.Â The base is there, the potential is there, so It only remains to prove it this season, that's why I've come, and that's why I'll make an effort and put my dedication to be able to enjoy it."" Xavi is a major reason in why Barcelona were successful last season and it appears the Camp Nou legend was also a factor in Gundogan wanting to join. ""I spoke with him several times before signing and I think we thought of football in the same way, the same as when he was a player and I as I am now.Â I think our way of thinking and our characters are similar, I had a great connection with him,"" he explained."
Why do Chelsea want Rayan Cherki?,"Jul 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/why-do-chelsea-want-rayan-cherki,"Chelsea want all of the footballers, let's be honest. But there is one player they really want right now and that is Rayan Cherki. The Lyon academy has produced special talent over the years and have a strong contingent coming through at the moment. Les Gones have often supplied the France Under-21 team with exciting youngsters on the rise. Cherki is one of them, so why exactly are Chelsea and so many of Europe's elite enchanted by him? 19-year-old winger Cherki has been involved in Lyon's first team since the 2019/20 season, flitting between the senior side and the reserves early on. However, he now has three heavily involved seasons in the first team under his belt, meaning he has mental and physical experience beyond his years. His versatility is another reason why Mauricio Pochettino wants to sign the Frenchman. Cherki has made the majority of his appearances in the number ten role but he has also played plenty of games on the left and right wings.   Cherki got five goals and six assists across Ligue 1 and the Coupe de France in 2022/23, which isn't incredible but there is genuine belief those numbers can grow as he develops further. Rather than focusing on just goals and assists, his various attacking metrics suggest he will get better. As shown by Sofascore, Cherki completed 81% of his passes in Ligue 1 last season, won an impressive 2.3 take-ons and 3.7 duels per appearance. He also created 14 big chances for his teammates. Cherki was only 16 when he broke into the Lyon team but coach Laurent Blanc spoke in 2022 about how he has had attitude problems in the past. ""He's a boy who has a lot of talent, everyone is practically unanimous on that,""Â Blanc saidÂ in 2022. ""He has a lot of talent, but it is necessary to use it well and use it for the good of the team. That was not always the case with Rayan and that led to some heated discussions with him. ""Rayan has been able to put his talent to good use. Afterwards, he must do even better. With him, you can be very demanding, because he has great potential. And while it's all well and good to say, 'I want to play, I want to play', you have to be able to keep it up and play well one match after another."" feed Chelsea are moving forward quite rapidly in their attempts to sign Rayan Cherki, partly prompted by Christian Pulisic's sale to AC Milan for â¬20m. That move frees up funds for a transfer fee, wages and some more space in the squad. 90min understands the Blues have reached out to Lyon to discuss a deal for Cherki this summer. Pulisic had been subject to previous interest from the French side but rejected their approach. A â¬50m price tag has been slapped on the France Under-21 international, though Chelsea are hopeful of striking a deal closer to â¬35m. Lyon are prepared to lose a number of first team players this summer due to financial problems and the healthy contact between the two clubs may work in Chelsea's favour. The west London side purchased full back Malo Gusto from Lyon in January for â¬30m and Cherki is understood to be keen to reunite with his former club teammate."
Two Man Utd players stay away from training amid uncertain futures,"Jul 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/two-man-utd-players-stay-away-from-training-amid-uncertain-futures,"Manchester United welcomed back international players to pre-season training on Saturday, those who were granted a longer holiday after representing their respective countries in June. Pre-season preparations for Erik ten Hagâs squad were already underway. But it was a primarily young team that the Dutchman put out against Leeds for last weekâs 2-0 friendly win in Oslo. The likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Hannibal Mejbri and Noam Emeran impressed during the game in Norway. France legend Raphael Varane was also there because he has retired from international football, while Lisandro Martinez and Mason Mount didnât get called up by Argentina or England respectively because of injuries they had each been carrying at the end of last season. But there were notable absentees throughout the travelling squad, with no Marcus Rashford, Casemiro, Bruno Fernandes, Alejandro Garnacho, Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof or Christian Eriksen to name a few. feed After just over a month off from the internationals that finished in the second week of June, most have now reported for duty back at Carrington. However, there were still two absentees on Saturday and they were Eric Bailly and Alex Telles. Neither player is believed to have a future at Old Trafford, having been pushed down the pecking order and out of favour. Bailly spent last season on loan at Marseille, where at one point he was slapped with a seven-game suspension for a wildly dangerous tackle, with Telles similarly at Sevilla. Both have a considerable number of players in the queue ahead of them for a regular place. Wednesdayâs friendly against Lyon in Edinburgh will likely still feature a number of young players but should equally provide some minutes for more senior stars. The pre-season tour of the United States that begins against Arsenal in New Jersey three days later will step that up. But it seems unlikely that Baily or Telles, without having reported back to training in the expectation that both will be leaving the club in the near future, will be involved."

Bayern Munich claim Harry Kane's 'decision' has been made over summer transfer,"Jul 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-harry-kane-decision-has-been-made-over-summer-transfer,"Bayern Munich honorary president Uli Hoeness has spoken about the club's hopes of signing Harry Kane this summer. Tottenham Hotspur have rejected two bids from the Bavarians for their star striker already this window and are insistent that he will not be sold. 90min understands that Spurs chairman Daniel Levy did meet with Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen this week, but does not intend to do business with any team regarding Kane, who is now into the final 12 months of his contract. Bayern are readying a club-record bid for Kane worth more than â¬80m and head coach Thomas Tuchel revealed on Saturday that they are ready to go 'all in' for the right transfer target. Speaking to the press shortly after Tuchel, Hoeness - who retains a place on Bayern's supervisory board - made candid comments about Kane, Levy and Tottenham. feed ""He [Kane] signalled very clearly that his decision was made. And if it stays that way, we'll get him,"" Hoeness insisted. ""Levy is clever. First we have to get him to name a price. He plays for time, is a great professional. I appreciate him very much. But on the other side [at Bayern] there aren't any people who have been doing this since yesterday. ""He wants to play internationally [in Europe]. Tottenham won't be there next season, unlike our club. He now has another opportunity to come to a top club in Europe. ""What we really like about Kane is that his advisors, that is his father and his brother, are very pleasant. So far they have always stood by what they have promised. And if it stays that way, then that's okay."""
Hugo Lloris exploring options in Europe and Saudi Arabia as Tottenham exit looms,"Jul 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/hugo-lloris-exploring-options-europe-saudi-arabia-tottenham-exit-looms,"Hugo Lloris is considering offers from across Europe as well as Saudi Arabia ahead of his expected departure from Tottenham Hotspur this summer, sources have told 90min. The former France international is into the final year of his contract at Spurs and has already made clear his desire to leave. Speaking to Nice Matin last month, Lloris said: ""We are coming to an important moment, for the club or for me. It's the end of an era. I have desires for other things. ""I will ask myself to study what is possible, but I don't forget that I still have one year left on my contract with Tottenham and that, in football, it is always difficult to predict what will happen."" Tottenham announced on Friday that Lloris would not travel with Ange Postecoglou's squad for their pre-season tour of Australia and Asia so that he could finalise a transfer. 90min understands that Lloris has offers on the table from clubs in the Saudi Pro League, but he is also keen to explore options to remain in Europe. feed When previously asked whether he would consider a move to Saudi Arabia, Lloris replied: ""You can't go from a successful World Cup to being an average player in a few months. I had a few hard knocks, I was a little inconsistent in my performance, I got injured twice. I came out of the World Cup pretty dull. The pace had been hellish before that."" Inter, who are expected to sell current starting goalkeeper Andre Onana to Manchester United this window, and hometown club Nice have been linked with a move for Lloris by the French press in recent weeks. Tottenham have already brought in a long-term replacement for Lloris in Italy goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario. They had previously pursued a deal for Brentford's David Raya, but despite agreeing personal terms, were reluctant to meet the Bees' Â£40m asking price. Lloris joined Spurs in 2012 on deadline day from Lyon and was made captain in 2015. He has made 447 appearances for Tottenham."
Lionel Messi signs contract with Inter Miami ,"Jul 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/lionel-messi-signs-contract-with-inter-miami,"Lionel Messi has officially signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with Inter Miami, joining on a free transfer following his Paris Saint-Germain exit. The player will occupy a Designated Player slot on the roster.  ""We are overjoyed that the greatest player in the world chose Inter Miami CF and Major League Soccer, and his decision is a testament to the momentum and energy behind our League and our sport in North America,"" said MLS commissioner Don Garber in a statement.  ""We have no doubt that Lionel will show the world that MLS can be a league of choice for the best players in the game. We look forward to seeing his debut for Inter Miami in our Leagues Cup tournament later this month.""  Lionel Messi's official MLS Inter Miami CF kits are available now. Messi previously announced his intention to play for the Major League Soccer side during a joint-interview with Mundo Deportivo and SPORT, revealing in June: ""Leaving European football, much more after winning the World Cup, was what I needed."" ""I made the decision that I am going to go to Miami. I still haven't closed it 100%. I'm missing some things but we decided to continue the path."" Though FC Barcelona remained confident of re-signing the 35-year-old for much of 2023 - with Messi's father, Jorge, even stating that his son wanted to return to the club at which he scored a record 672 goals in 778 appearances - the club's financial situation drove him to choose the American league. ""I had offers from other European teams but I didn't even evaluate them because my idea was to go to Barcelona,"" Messi continued. ""If the Barcelona thing didn't work out, then leaving European football, much more after winning the World Cup, was what I needed. Finishing my career on this side and living the United States league in a different way, enjoying day to day much more but with the same responsibility of wanting to win and always doing things well, but with more peace of mind."" Now, Messi is expected to make his Inter Miami debut on July 21 during the team's inaugural Leagues Cup match against Cruz Azul at DRV PNK Stadium in Fort Lauderdale Florida.  He will also reunite with former Barcelona players Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets, who will officially join Inter Miami later this week for their first training session.Â The three played together in Spain from 2012 to 2021, winning five La Liga titles, six Copa del Rey and one Champions League.  The players will feature under former Barcelona head coach Gerardo 'Tata' Martino, who replaced Phil Neville as manager on June 28.  The reinforcements will serve Miami well, as they sit in last place of the Eastern Conference table with a mere 18 points in 21 games and a 5W-13L-3D record.

Thomas Tuchel hints Bayern Munich will go 'all in' for Harry Kane,"Jul 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/thomas-tuchel-hints-bayern-munich-will-go-all-in-harry-kane,"Bayern Munich head coach Thomas Tuchel has discussed the club's pursuit of Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane. The Bavarians' interest in the England captain dates back to last summer when former boss Julian Nagelsmann revealed his admiration for Kane, but that a deal would be hard for the club to follow through with due to Spurs' likely demands. With Kane now into the final year of his contract, Bayern have firmed up their interest with two bids for him this transfer window, but twice have been knocked back by Tottenham. 90min reported earlier this week that the Bundesliga champions were readying a new club-record bid for Kane worth north of â¬80m, while Spurs chairman Daniel Levy has met with Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen in person. However, there remains no indication that Tottenham will budge and sanction a sale of Kane this summer. feed Speaking at his first press conference of pre-season, Tuchel was inevitably quizzed on Bayern's interest in Kane, and though he refused to talk at length about the 29-year-old, he revealed the club could go 'all in' for the right target.

If we find someone that fits in, then we'll go all in. If we don't find anyone, we're happy with our squad. But we need more patience.""

Inter walk away from Romelu Lukaku talks with Chelsea,"Jul 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/inter-walk-away-from-romelu-lukaku-talks-with-chelsea,"Inter have informed Chelsea that they no longer wish to pursue the signing of striker Romelu Lukaku, 90min understands. The two clubs spent months negotiating in the hope of seeing Lukaku return to Inter on a permanent basis and an agreement was close to being struck before talks completely collapsed on Friday evening. A large part of Inter's willingness to keep negotiating with Chelsea was their belief that Lukaku was only focused on joining them. The Belgian has already rebuffed advances from Saudi Arabia and told Inter that a return to San Siro was the only thing on his mind. However, Inter officials now believe that Lukaku and his entourage have held talks with other clubs, including fierce rivals Juventus, over a possible summer transfer. While such conversations are legal and standard at this stage of negotiations, Inter have been left disappointed by the situation as they believed Lukaku's only interest was returning to the Nerazzurri - a message which sources insist came from the player himself. As a result, Inter have informed Chelsea that they no longer wish to pursue Lukaku and have walked away from talks. feed Chelsea had initially scheduled Lukaku's pre-season return for last week but pushed that date back until Monday in the hope that a deal to sell the striker would have been struck before he even needed to come back. Now, however, Lukaku is expected back at Cobham on Monday, although Chelsea currently have no plans to take the Belgian with them on their pre-season tour of the United States. Instead, Lukaku is exploring all his options. Juventus have discussed a summer deal, while the offers from Saudi Arabia have never been withdrawn despite the Belgian's initial reluctance to listen to the proposals. Sources at Chelsea still believe that Inter could reignite their interest if their relationship with Lukaku can be rebuilt, although that currently looks unlikely."

Palace have identified Franca as a potential replacement for Wilfried Zaha, who is currently a free agent after his contract at Selhurst Park, although the Ivorian could still end up signing an extension. The Eagles could move for Franca even if they can re-sign Zaha.

Santos winger Angelo Gabriel is expected to follow suit. feed Franca inked a new contract back in February and remains under contract until the end of 2027, giving Flamengo plenty of security when it comes to negotiations. Chelsea are keen to bolster in attack this summer and are also interested in another 19-year-old, Lyon's Rayan Cherki. As well as chasing new signings, Chelsea continue to discuss a number of potential sales and are hopeful of parting ways with Romelu Lukaku, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Hakim Ziyech before the new season gets underway. Lukaku and Aubameyang have seen their pre-season return dates pushed back to Monday as Chelsea hope to have found buyers by then, while Hudson-Odoi is training with the Under-21s as he explores his own move away."

West Ham confirm departure of Declan Rice to Arsenal,"Jul 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-confirm-departure-declan-rice-arsenal,"West Ham have confirmed the departure of Declan Rice, who joins Arsenal for a British record transfer fee. The Gunners have heavily pursued a move for the England midfielder over the last few months, making him a priority target this transfer window. 90min first reported of Arsenal's interest in Rice back in January, but they faced stiff competition for his signature. Despite productive talks at the beginning of June, Arsenal initially angered West Ham with their low-ball bidding. The Hammers stood firm on their demands of a nine-figure sum to be paid largely up front, with Arsenal eventually agreeing to a British-record Â£105m fee. manual Rice prioritised a move to Mikel Arteta's side over other suitors such as Manchester City, who ultimately were not prepared to match the Gunners' final offer, as well as Chelsea and Bayern Munich. And the 24-year-old has now completed his switch across London to the Emirates Stadium. Rice leaves West Ham as one of only three men to have lifted a trophy as the captain of West Ham, following in the footsteps of club legends Bobby Moore and Billy Bonds. He played a starring role in their Europa Conference League triumph at the end of the 2022/23 season, beating Fiorentina in a memorable final in Prague."
Fulham reject second bid from Saudi Arabia for Aleksandar Mitrovic,"Jul 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/fulham-reject-second-bid-from-saudi-arabia-for-aleksandar-mitrovic,"Fulham have rejected a fresh approach from Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal for star striker Aleksandar Mitrovic, sources have told 90min. The Serbia international solidified his place as one of the Premier League's leading forwards last season, scoring 14 goals in 24 games following the Whites' promotion back to the top flight and finishing above rivals Chelsea in the table. Mitrovic has become a cult figure at Fulham during his six seasons in west London, but his future is uncertain amid interest from Saudi Arabia. 90min reported earlier this week that he and manager Marco Silva are being targeted by the Saudi Pro League, with Fulham already rejecting a Â£25m offer from Al Hilal for Mitrovic. feed Sources have now confirmed to 90min that Al Hilal returned with a new bid of nearly Â£30m, but this was again quickly knocked back by Fulham. Mitrovic is believed to be open to a move to Saudi Arabia and would like to at least have the chance to explore such a transfer, but Fulham are standing firm and at this stage do not have any plans to sell him. Al Hilal recently completed the signing of Mitrovic's compatriot and close friend Sergej Milinikovic-Savic from Lazio. They have also brought in Ruben Neves from Wolves and Kalidou Koulibaly from Chelsea. Meanwhile, 90min understands Fulham are looking to beat a number of Europe's top sides to the signature of 21-year-old Brazil midfielder Andre Trindade."
Manchester City expecting formal offer from Bayern Munich for Kyle Walker,"Jul 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/manchester-city-expecting-formal-offer-bayern-munich-kyle-walker,"Manchester City are expecting Bayern Munich to formalise their interest in Kyle Walker with an offer, 90min understands. The 33-year-old's future at the Etihad Stadium has come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks, stemming from Pep Guardiola's decision to omit Walker from his Champions League final starting lineup - a move that is understood to have hurt the former Tottenham fullback. 90min revealed in June that Walker, who is into the final 12 months of his City contract, had held initial discussions with Bayern over a move to the Bundesliga, with the Bavarians expecting to part ways with Benjamin Pavard this summer having already turned down the opportunity to make Joao Cancelo's loan from City a permanent deal. City are not expecting to welcome Cancelo back into the fold, despite his positional versatility, and have instead moved to offer Walker a new contract, in the hope that he will commit his future to the club in preference to seeking a new challenge. But 90min understands that City have been informed of Walker's desire to pursue a move to Bayern, with whom he has now agreed terms in principle. feed The seven-time Premier League winners are expecting Bayern to formalise their interest with a bid, though it's unclear at this stage how much Thomas Tuchel's side are prepared to offer. Much could depend on the future of Pavard, who may actually be in the frame to replace Walker in Manchester given his ability to play in central defence as well as at right-back. Bayern's move may also hinge on how much money they are willing to commit to a potential deal for Tottenham striker Harry Kane. Two bids for the England captain have already been rejected by Spurs chairman Daniel Levy, though dialogue has continued between the two clubs as the 2020 Champions League winners look to pull off a seemingly impossible transfer. As for City, they have long committed to selling players who no longer want to be at the club - indicating they will sell Walker to Bayern for the right price - and his departure may open up the opportunity for Rico Lewis, who was rewarded with a new long-term contract earlier this year, to play more first-team football. Their stance may be challenged, however, should Bernardo Silva, long linked with Barcelona and PSG, continue to seek a new challenge, while Riyad Mahrez, who was left out of City's side for both the FA Cup and Champions League final, is being courted by the Saudi Pro League and may find an offer impossible to turn down."
Arsenal confirm Jurrien Timber signing from Ajax,"Jul 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-confirm-jurrien-timber-signing-from-ajax,"Arsenal have announced the signing of Netherlands international defender Jurrien Timber after reaching an agreement for his transfer with Ajax. Timber, who won two Eredivisie titles in Amsterdam, has signed a long-term deal and becomes the Gunners' second incoming transfer of the summer after Kai Havertz swapped Stamford Bridge for the Emirates in late June. Speaking to Arsenal's club channels on Timber's signing, Mikel Arteta said: ""We're really excited that Jurrien has joined us. He is a versatile young defender, who will fit into our system and provide our squad with so much added quality. ""Jurrien is a young player, but has already achieved so much. He has experienced what it's like to go to a major international tournament on more than one occasion, as well as the trophies he has won with Ajax. We look forward to welcoming and integrating Jurrien into the squad."" feed The Dutchman was absent for Ajax's first outdoor training session of the summer as his Â£40m move to Arsenal approached completion. Personal terms had already been agreed before Arsenal thrashed out a fee with Ajax. Timber predominantly played at centre-back during the 2022/23 season but has also played out wide on the right. His strong passing ability and eagerness to dribble could mirror Oleksandr Zinchenko's role on the left should manager Mikel Arteta continue with the central partnership of William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhaes. The 22-year-old spent time in Feyenoord's youth set-up before joining Ajax in 2014. He signed his first professional contract in 2018 and played for the development Jong side before making his Eredivisie debut in 2020. Ajax were then managed by current Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag and Timber was previously a target for the Red Devils last year. United continued their interest earlier this summer before Arsenal and Liverpool joined them in watching the defender. Arsenal submitted an opening bid of â¬35m which was rejected by the Dutch club, who set the asking price at â¬60m. Confidence grew in north London over a successful transfer and Ajax soon lowered their desired sum to â¬50m. â¬42m will be paid up front with an extra â¬5m in add-ons. The Gunners are still looking to wrap up the final details of their move for West Ham and England midfielder Declan Rice. Arteta's side managed to swat away competition from Manchester City to agree a Â£105m deal with the Hammers while the future of Thomas Partey remains uncertain. Granit Xhaka's exit for Bayer Leverkusen was confirmed on Thursday."
Erik ten Hag reveals Man Utd's plan for Amad Diallo,"Jul 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/erik-ten-hag-man-utd-plan-amad-diallo,"Erik ten Hag insists he plans to keep working with winger Amad Diallo this summer before making a decision on his short-term future at the club. The 21-year-old, a Â£37m signing from Atalanta in 2021, enjoyed an impressive loan spell in the Championship with Sunderland last season, bagging 14 goals and four assists in all competitions for the Black Cats. Now back at United, Amad started the pre-season opener against Leeds and enjoyed an impressive 45-minute showing before widespread changes were made at half-time. After the game, Ten Hag said it was too early to draw conclusions on Amad but did admit some of the squad's youngsters had caught his eye. ""You donât make conclusions after one week,"" the Dutchman said of Amad, who has attracted plenty of loan interest from elsewhere. ""Some of the young players impressed me, but I donât want to single someone out. We are just in the first week, and I expected these levels and these performances. feed ""I will tell them during our sessions what I expect from them. How we judge the levels, the performance on Wednesday, what they have to work on. But after one week I never make conclusions."" Among those likely to have caught the eye is 18-year-old academy midfielder Kobbie Mainoo, who managed three senior appearances under Ten Hag last season and has been tipped to play a greater role in the first team next season. ""Itâs the first game and I think we have seen some good things,"" Ten Hag reflected to MUTV. ""Weâve already trained over the last year, so we have a good foundation. You can see that in the game. But yeah, also some young lads came in and they fit in. We are now one week [into] training. We presented the rules and the principles. And what I see, what can I say: we have seen some good stuff."""
Man Utd & Barcelona fined by UEFA over financial breaches,"Jul 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-barcelona-fined-uefa-financial-breaches,"UEFA have confirmed Manchester United and Barcelona have been fined for failing to abide by their financial regulations. The European governing body drew up a lengthy list of clubs whose financial dealings between 2019 and 2022 would be monitored amid concerns over potential breaches of rules, with both United and Barcelona under observation. With all financial reports now submitted, UEFA have studied the numbers and ruled that the two clubs fell marginally short of requirements and have issued minor fines. United reported 'minor break-even deficits' and have been handed a â¬300,000 fine - three times as high as the other two clubs in the same situation, Konyaspor and APOEL FC of Turkey and Cyprus respectively. As for Barcelona, their fine of â¬500,000 stems from the misreporting of 'profits on disposal of intangible assets (other than player transfers) which are not a relevant income under the regulations'. feed A further nine clubs were monitored during the 2022/23 season after being set financial targets by UEFA, with French side Lille meeting the criteria and being removed from the watch list as a result. AC Milan, Monaco, Roma, Besiktas, Inter, Marseille and PSG all reached their targets for the 2022 financial year but will remain under observation to ensure compliance in 2023. Istanbul Basaksehir of Turkey fell short of their targets and have been hit with a â¬400,000 fine."
Callum Hudson-Odoi given permission to explore Chelsea exit,"Jul 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/callum-hudson-odoi-permission-chelsea-exit,"Chelsea have granted winger Callum Hudson-Odoi permission to explore a move away from Stamford Bridge this summer, 90min understands. The 22-year-old recently returned from a frustrating loan spell with Bayer Leverkusen which yielded just seven Bundesliga starts and has now entered the final 12 months of his contract with Chelsea. Following talks between the two parties, Hudson-Odoi is now exploring a move away from his boyhood club and sources have confirmed to 90min that contact has been made with teams from all across the globe. In England, Hudson-Odoi is understood to have attracted interest from Everton, Fulham and Nottingham Forest, but the opportunity to move to mainland Europe with clubs from France, Germany and Italy is also on the table. There is even interest in Hudson-Odoi from Saudi Arabia and Major League Soccer, and all options are being explored as it stands. feed Chelsea are currently looking for a permanent transfer but would be open to a loan with a mandatory purchase clause next summer - an option which would require a 12-month extension of Hudson-Odoi's current contract. Hudson-Odoi has managed 126 appearances for Chelsea since his debut in the 2017/18 season but struggled to hold down a permanent starting place and saw his momentum derailed by injury. An Achilles injury in April 2019 brought his progress under Maurizio Sarri to an abrupt end and a similar problem followed three years later, meaning his last Chelsea appearance came in March 2022 in an FA Cup victory over Luton Town. Chelsea are looking to rejuvenate their attacking lineup this summer and have voiced an interest in Lyon's Rayan Cherki."
Man Utd reject Galatasaray bid for Fred,"Jul 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-reject-galatasaray-bid-fred,"Manchester United have turned down an initial offer from Turkish side Galatasaray for midfielder Fred, 90min understands. Fred has fallen down the pecking order at Old Trafford and is understood to be considering his options, with United prepared to cash in on the 30-year-old Brazilian for the right price. United are seeking over Â£20m to part ways with Fred and 90min understands an opening proposal from Galatasaray has been rejected after falling short of that valuation. There remains plenty of interest in Fred's services but United's asking price could prove problematic. Fulham have targeted the midfielder but have made it clear that they do not share United's value of Fred. The Cottagers also have other targets in mind, including another Brazilian, 21-year-old Andre Trindade of Fluminense. feed Nottingham Forest have made contact with Fred's representatives but have not advanced their interest at this point. Roma have also reached out. The most concrete interest in Fred's services currently comes from Saudi Arabia but the midfielder is not believed to have made a decision on whether to leave United or not this summer. Fred managed 56 appearances in all competitions last season - only Bruno Fernandes and David de Gea featured in more games - but only 23 of those came as a starter. The summer arrival of Mason Mount from Chelsea has only added to the competition for minutes in Erik ten Hag's midfield, forcing Fred to consider his options."
Liverpool considering move for long-term Chelsea target Moises Caicedo,"Jul 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-considering-move-chelsea-target-moises-caicedo,"Liverpool are keeping a close eye on Chelsea's push for Moises Caicedo as they consider making their own move for the Ecuador international, 90min understands. The Reds entered this summer with a view to rebuilding in midfield and have already spent Â£95m on Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai from Brighton and RB Leipzig respectively. There had already been plans to sign a third midfielder, with Southampton's Romeo Lavia admired at Anfield, but Liverpool could soon find themselves needing further reinforcements as both Fabinho and Jordan Henderson are considering moves to Saudi Arabia. Steven Gerrard's Al Ettifaq are pushing to sign Henderson, while Fabinho has significant interest from Saudi champions Al Ittihad, who are managed by former Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo. Thiago Alcantara is also a target in the Middle East. Should any of the trio leave, Liverpool may be forced to buying a new midfielder, and with the possibility of raising a significant sum of money unexpectedly, a move for Caicedo has been considered. feed Caicedo is top of Chelsea's transfer wish list and the Blues have long been in talks with Brighton over a deal to sign the 21-year-old, who the Seagulls value at Â£100m. Chelsea have been looking to negotiate a discount and have not yet submitted a formal offer, instead seeking an informal agreement with Brighton to ensure their first official bid is accepted. However, Liverpool are now considering a late move for Caicedo, with their next move set to depend on Fabinho and Henderson's decisions. The duo are yet to decide if they want to head to the Saudi Pro League, and while manager Jurgen Klopp has made it clear he does not want to lose either, he is prepared to listen to offers if Fabinho or Henderson indicate they would like to leave."

Harry Kane: Tottenham chief Daniel Levy meets with Bayern Munich ,"Jul 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/harry-kane-tottenham-chief-daniel-levy-meets-bayern-munich,"Tottenham Hotspur chairman Daniel Levy met with Bayern Munich this week, sources have confirmed to 90min, with Harry Kane's future one of the topics of discussion. Bayern Munich CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen travelled to London on Thursday to have a face-to-face meeting with Levy as they continue their pursuit of Spurs captain Kane. Bayern have seen two bids rejected out-of-hand but Tottenham and their stance remains that Kane is not for sale. Tottenham sources insist that the meeting was not just about Kane, but the England striker's future was discussed. It is understood that Levy gave no price to Dreesen and offered no suggestion or encouragement that he would accept any bids.  feed Despite Levy's stance, Bayern are still expected to make a third offer which would represent a club record bid, as the Bavarian giants are convinced that Kane wants to move to the Allianz Arena. Levy accepts and understands why Kane would be tempted by other clubs, but 90min understands that he has made it clear to his captain's camp that they would make him one of the highest paid players in Europe if he signed a new deal and also laid out a map for him once his playing career comes to a close. Kane, for his part, has confirmed to the club that he is going on their Asia-Pacific pre-season tour, while his representatives continue talks with various parties.  Kane returned to training this week and met new Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou for the first time and club sources believe the initial meetings were hugely positive."
The wages Jordan Henderson is set to earn at Al Ettifaq in Saudi Pro League,"Jul 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/wages-jordan-henderson-al-ettifaq-saudi-pro-league,"There is a certain profile of footballer that many Saudi Pro League clubs have been targeting this summer as they look to acquire some huge names. Big name stars on the wrong side of 30 who still have a lot to offer and could be tempted to play in an easier league for a lot more money.  That is what has happened with players like Karim Benzema, Cristiano Ronaldo and N'Golo Kante. It could soon be what happens to Jordan Henderson, which would arguably be the biggest coup of them all in the sense that he is the captain of one of the biggest clubs in the world, and he is not out of contract and hasn't been linked with a move away up until this point.  The man behind the rumours is likely Steven Gerrard, who is the new coach of Al Ettifaq, the team that wants to stuff Henderson's mouth with gold to put his Premier League career behind him.  manual The phrase 'life-changing'  has been thrown around a lot this summer as a way of rationalising why players are deciding to move to Saudi Arabia. Whilst the money on offer is life-changing, it takes extremely rich individuals to an even higher level of richness. The phrase 'life-changing' has to be contextualised. That aside, Al Ettifaq are willing to give Henderson four times more money than he currently earns at Liverpool. At the moment, Henderson gets paid around Â£190,000 per week to be the captain of Liverpool, a club that he has been playing for since joining from Sunderland in 2011. If he makes the move to Saudi Arabia, he is set to be paid Â£700,000 per week...or Â£100,000 per day. 90min understands that Henderson hasn't ruled out trading Merseyside for the middle east and Liverpool will not stand in his way if that is to be his decision. Many fans have been very quick to criticise the midfielder for even entertaining the move. This is because Henderson strongly aligned himself with the Rainbow Laces campaign in 2021 and was quoted in a matchday programme saying: ""I do believe when you see something that is clearly wrong and makes another human being feel excluded you should stand shoulder-to-shoulder with them. ""You also have a responsibility to educate yourself better around the challenges they experience. Thatâs where my own position on homophobia in football is rooted. Before Iâm a footballer, Iâm a parent, a husband, a son, a brother and a friend to the people in my life who matter so much to me. The idea that any of them would feel excluded from playing or attending a football match, simply for being and identifying as who they are, blows my mind. ""The idea theyâd have to hide from it to be accepted? But thatâs exactly how too many members of the LGBT+ community feel. We know this because they tell us. So we should listen, support them and work to make it better."" Homosexuality remains illegal in Saudi Arabia and many are disappointed that, having shown such support on multiple occasions to the LGBTQ+ community, Henderson would willingly personally profit to such an enormous extent from a Saudi Arabian club. LGBTQ+ fan group Kop Outs tweeted a statement in response to the news that Henderson may play in Saudi Arabia, which said: ""Kop Outs have valued the allyship shown by Jordan Henderson. ""We are appalled and concerned that anyone might consider working for a #sportswashing operation for a regime where women & LGBT+ people are oppressed & that regularly tops the world death sentence table? ""We hope that Jordan Henderson proves to be a man of his word and stays true to the values of our club, which so far he has been an absolute embodiment of."""
Fulham hoping to sign Brazil midfielder offered to European giants,"Jul 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/fulham-hoping-sign-brazil-midfielder-offered-barcelona-liverpool-arsenal,"Fulham are hopeful of beating some of Europe's biggest clubs to a deal for Brazil international midfielder Andre Trindade, 90min understands. The Fluminense midfielder was a target for Fulham in January. They could not get a deal over the line then, but their interest in the 21-year-old has remained. Fulham were close to a deal at just under Â£20m during the winter transfer window, but any agreement now may have to be nearer the Â£25m mark. Since the Cottagers' initial interest, Andre has made his full international debut and a number of clubs are taking a keen interest in his future. feed 90min understands that the likes of Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and West Ham have all been spoken to by the player's representatives in recent months. But it is Fulham who are making a firm push and are confident of finalising a deal. Fulham, who are also in for Brazilian defender Igor from Fiorentina, are yet to make a breakthrough in the transfer market this summer, but they have already lost out to Tottenham over Israeli winger Manor Solomon. They could yet see Willian move on as the veteran Brazilian has turned down the opening offer of a new contract and is now weighing up options elsewhere, despite an improved offer on the table.  The club are also battling to fend off Saudi Arabian interest in both their manager manager Marco Silva and star striker Aleksandar Mitrovic."
Defensive midfielders Liverpool could sign to replace Jordan Henderson or Fabinho,"Jul 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/defensive-midfielders-liverpool-could-sign-replace-jordan-henderson-fabinho,"Jurgen Klopp took a defiant tone when the strength of Liverpool's midfield was questioned in July 2022. ""Fabinho, Henderson, Thiago, Milner, Keita, Curtis Jones, Harvey Elliott, Fabio Carvalho, Oxlade-Chamberlain,"" the manager rattled off. ""Now you tell me what kind of player are we missing?"" Well, Klopp has lost plenty of those players in just 12 months. James Milner, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain were allowed to leave at the end of their contracts and Carvalho will spend next season on loan at RB Leipzig. Thiago Alcantara fended off interest from Saudi Arabia but Jordan Henderson and Fabinho may not be as strong willed. Liverpool's skipper is considering an offer to reunite with former teammate Steven Gerrard at Al Ettifaq while Pro League champions Al-Ittihad are keen on adding Fabinho to a side which includes Karim Benzema, N'Golo Kante and Jota (not Diogo). Klopp has already bolstered Liverpool's offensive central options with the acquisitions of Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai this summer. But the base of midfield will need to be stiffened up if one or both of Henderson and Fabinho chase the Saudi silver. Here are some alternatives which Klopp may want to mull over. Age: 19Club: Southampton Liverpool are one of at least six clubs that harbour a burning desire to prevent Southampton's Lavia from slipping into the Championship. A tenacious attitude off the ball and an eye for a defence-splitting pass are some of the attributes that make him so sought after. However, the 19-year-old is understandably raw. Liverpool already have a promising teenager capable of fulfilling Fabinho's duties at the base of midfield in the form of Stefan Bajcetic and are reticent to meet Southampton's lofty Â£45m asking price for Lavia. Age: 22Club: Nice Thuram insisted that he was 'happy' at Nice in June but that was before the club took the surprising decision to turn down the chance to make Didier Digard permanent manager. Thuram forged a strong bond with the interim boss who 'helped me a lot in difficult times in my young career'. The burgeoning midfielder described Digard as 'someone I can never thank enough'. Klopp inspires similar loyalty from many of his players and will be itching to bring Thuram's blend of dexterity and industry to Merseyside. While he may not offer the natural defensive rigidity of Fabinho, Thuram brings the drive that had begun to fade from Henderson's game last season. Age: 25Club: PSV Eindhoven Nottingham Forest have been nowhere near as active as last summer's splurge but the Tricky Trees have identified PSV's Sangare as a potential recruit. Liverpool haven't directly vied with Forest for many transfers since the early 1980s but they would also benefit from the acquisition of the towering midfielder. Boasting a yawning wingspan of limbs that can gobble up the ball and send it firing towards the opposition net at a frightening velocity, PSV were understandably thrilled when Sangare signed a five-year deal last summer.  However, the departure of manager Ruud van Nistelrooy has knocked the club sideways, with Sangare thought to be one of the fiercest critics of the move. This unease could offer Liverpool an opening to pounce. Age: 23Club: Real Madrid While watching the 2022 Champions League final, Tchouameni began fervently messaging his representatives. Liverpool and Real Madrid, the two finalists in Paris last year, had been in the race for the Frenchman's signature but Tchouameni had decided; he wanted to join the Champions League winners. Without quite setting the world alight, Tchouameni enjoyed a decent debut campaign in the Spanish capital, aided by his rapid grasp of the language. However, through little fault of his own, Tchouameni could be on his way out of Madrid after Los Blancos added Jude Bellingham to their bulging roster. Liverpool were also heavily linked with Bellingham this summer but could end up getting former flirt Tchouameni - it would certainly be a case of better late than never. Age: 22Club: Borussia Monchengladbach Already an established starter for Borussia Monchengladbach, Kone has been keen to stress his development. ""I could be labelled an 'up-and-coming player',"" the France under-21 international explained, ""...but I wouldn't say I'm a 'young player', as I've already picked up quite a few things."" Those qualities include a beguiling ability to weave forward with the ball and win back possession. No Bundesliga midfielder was fouled more often than the wriggling menace who finished the season as Gladbach's leader for tackles, blocks and recoveries."
Christian Pulisic officially leaves Chelsea for AC Milan ,"Jul 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/christian-pulisic-officially-leaves-chelsea-ac-milan,"Serie A side AC Milan has signed US men's national team figure Christian Pulisic from Chelsea FC on a four year contract, with an additional option for 2028.  The 24-year-old departs the Premier League after four years, where he managed 145 appearances across all competitions and a UEFA Champions League title in 2021. Now, the Stars and Stripes captain becomes just the third American to play for the Rosseneri after Oguchi Onyewu (now vice president of sporting for USA) and Sergino Dest.

The forward is coming off a poor 2022/23 season, scoring only one goal and one assist in 24 games with Chelsea.

Pulisic now joins a frontline that boasts the likes of Olivier Giroud and Rafael Leao, with Milan still looking to add more signings up front. "
Aston Villa rebuffed with opening offer for Moussa Diaby,"Jul 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/aston-villa-rebuffed-opening-offer-moussa-diaby,"Aston Villa have had a bid rejected by Bayer Leverkusen for French winger Moussa Diaby, sources have confirmed to 90min. Villa are in the market for wingers and have already seen moves for Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams and Barcelona pair Ferran Torres and Ansu Fati fail to materialise. They also came close to landing Marcos Asensio, before the Spaniard chose to join Paris Saint Germain after leaving Real Madrid. However, Villa are working hard on options - which also include Nottingham Forest's Brennan Johnson - and have turned their attention to Diaby, who has long been a target for Premier League clubs. Newcastle have been long-term suitors and held talks last summer, while Arsenal have also been monitoring his situation for a number of months. But Villa made the first move and have lodged an opening offer worth â¬35m (Â£30m) plus add-ons. 90min understands that Leverkusen wasted little time in rejecting the bid though. The Bundesliga club have made it clear they want around â¬60m (Â£51m) for Diaby, although sources have told 90min that they expect an offer worth over â¬50m (Â£43m) could be enough to land the 24-year-old, who is under contact at the BayArena until 2025. Talks have already taken place with Diaby's camp and the belief is that he would be happy to move to Villa Park, where Unai Emery, along with new president of footballing operations Monchi, is plotting an assault on the Premier League top four after a blistering end to last season. feed Having already landed Belgian midfielder Youri Tielemans and Spanish defender Pau Torres, Villa have now turned their attention to the attacking third of the pitch and it is believed they could bring in two new forwards - they now hope one of those is Diaby. It is understood that talks have continued, despite Leverkusen rejecting the first offer. The Germans remain hopeful that Diaby will opt to stay put and continue his development under Xabi Alonso. In that respect, the winger has admitted he has enjoyed life under the boss so far. ""When he got here, the first thing he did was to change the mentality within the squad. He asked us to forget about what happened before he got there, and told us to play as if we were starting a new season,"" Diaby explained. ""He brought his experience to the club; he uses what he has been through as a player to help us improve on a daily basis. He's done really well so far, so long may it continue. We're very happy that he's our head coach."""
Chelsea open talks with Lyon over Rayan Cherki,"Jul 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-open-talks-lyon-rayan-cherki,"Chelsea have reached out to Lyon to discuss a summer deal for 19-year-old midfielder Rayan Cherki, 90min understands. The Blues are rejuvenating their attacking line this summer. Both Mason Mount and Kai Havertz have already left, while Christian Pulisic's move to AC Milan is imminent and there are further plans to part ways with Hakim Ziyech, Romelu Lukaku, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Callum Hudson-Odoi. Nicolas Jackson and Christopher Nkunku have arrived at Stamford Bridge but another creative forward is desired and sources have confirmed to 90min that Cherki has emerged as a player of real interest. Chelsea officials have followed Cherki for a while now and have been hugely impressed by the 19-year-old, and the Blues have reached out to Lyon to discuss a possible summer move. Lyon, who are prepared to offload a handful of big names as they battle financial problems, have put a price tag of â¬50m (Â£43m) on Cherki's head. Such a fee is thought to be too high for Chelsea, who believe a deal can be struck for closer to the â¬35m (Â£30m) mark.  feed The two clubs have already had plenty of contact in 2023. Chelsea bought right-back Malo Gusto from Lyon in January for a fee of â¬30m and loaned him back to the French side for the remainder of the season, while Lyon submitted a bid for winger Pulisic which was rejected by the player himself. Cherki, whose contract has two years left to run, is understood to be keen to reunite with Gusto at Stamford Bridge. Elsewhere, 90min understands that Chelsea chiefs have held talks over another French star, Montpellier striker Elye Wahi, while Egyptian winger Ibrahim Adel has also emerged as a potential signing. Both players could be targets for the Blues' new sister side, Strasbourg. Strasbourg have also been touted to seal the loan signing of Brazilian starlet Angelo Gabriel, whose move from Santos to Chelsea is expected to be confirmed imminently."
Everton in talks over deal for Man Utd winger,"Jul 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/everton-talks-deal-man-utd-winger-anthony-elanga,"Everton are in talks over a potential deal for Manchester United winger Anthony Elanga, 90min understands, with the Swede also attracting interest from a number of other Premier League clubs, as well as those in the Championship and Turkish giants Galatasaray. Elanga turned 21 in April and has been a permanent member of the first-team squad at Old Trafford since 2021. He has made 55 senior appearances to date, including 26 this past season. But the former Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year only started five times in the Premier League and not at all in 2023, coinciding with the emergence of Alejandro Garnacho. He also failed to find the net and registered just two assists, always difficult with limited minutes off the bench. With competition for wide places ahead of 2023/24 coming from the increasingly important Garnacho, as well as Marcus Rashford and Â£160m duo Jadon Sancho and Antony, Elanga may find opportunities increasingly hard to come by. Erik ten Hag also has Facundo Pellistri at his disposal, while Noam Emeran pushed himself into contention with a goal and assist in pre-season this week. 90min understands that Everton are eyeing a permanent transfer for Elanga, although budgetary constraints could see their approach take the form of an initial loan with obligation to buy. The Toffees have signed only one player this summer and that is 38-year-old free agent Ashley Young. feed But Everton are not the only club keeping tabs on Elanga. Nottingham Forest have held talks of their own, with Fulham and Crystal Palace also watching the situation. Prior interest had come from the Championship, which has been a happy development league for fellow United youngsters Amad Diallo, Hannibal Mejbri and Alvaro Fernandez within the last 12 months â all three started and impressed in the Leeds friendly in Norway this week. Middlesbrough, Coventry, Stoke and Birmingham, the latter where Hannibal was based and with whom United have also previously done business over Tahith Chong, have shown interest. Galatasaray, crowned Turkish champions last season for the first time in four years, have had Elanga on their radar from a little further afield. Elanga has another three years left on the United contract he signed in 2021."
Liverpool considering offer from Saudi Arabia for Fabinho,"Jul 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-considering-offer-saudi-arabia-fabinho,"Liverpool are weighing up an offer from Saudi Pro League champions Al Ittihad for Fabinho, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Reds are in the midst of a rebuild with a heavy emphasis on retooling in the midfield department, already signing Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai this transfer window. 90min reported on Thursday that Jordan Henderson is considering an offer to join Al Ettifaq, who are managed by Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard. Thiago Alcantara has rejected the chance to move to the Saudi Pro League this summer, and now a third Liverpool midfielder is the subject of interest from the Middle Eastern state. 90min understands that while Liverpool had not planned to lose many midfielders this summer, they are contemplating whether to sell Fabinho to Al Ittihad after receiving an offer. The Saudi champions have added Karim Benzema, N'Golo Kante and Jota to their ranks already this window and Fabinho is believed to be keen to join them. feed Jurgen Klopp's side could step up their interest in midfield targets on their shortlist if they sanction further sales, with Southampton's Romeo Lavia and Bayern Munich's Ryan Gravenberch on their radar. Fabinho's form noticeable dipped during Liverpool's disappointing 2022/23 season, finishing fifth in the Premier League and suffering premature exits from the Champions League, FA Cup and Carabao Cup. The Brazilian joined Liverpool from Monaco for an initial Â£39m fee and has won every competition he has competed in with the Reds since."
Oriol Romeu: Girona president confirms meeting with Barcelona,"Jul 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/oriol-romeu-girona-president-confirms-meeting-barcelona,"Girona president Pere Guardiola has admitted he is not planning to part ways with midfielder Oriol Romeu this summer but revealed he has a meeting scheduled with Barcelona in the coming days. Barcelona want two new midfielders this summer following the departure of the influential Sergio Busquets and former La Masia starlet Romeu has been identified as a serious target. The 31-year-old has a release clause of under â¬10m written into the Girona contract he signed last summer, making him a feasible target for Barcelona. Barcelona president Joan Laporta recently angered Girona fans by claiming to L'Esportiu: ""If we sign a player from Girona, BarÃ§a is helping Girona. Any purchase operation we do with Girona, or loaning them players, I think we're helping Girona. I see it that way."" In response, Girona's Guardiola urged Laporta to rethink his approach if they truly want to 'help'. ""If BarÃ§a wants to do us a favour, they don't sign Oriol from us,"" Guardiola told the media. ""It's a reality. We're planning the season with him here, so they're not doing us any favours. feed ""17-18 days ago we spoke with Mateu [Alemany, Barcelona sporting director] to find out what the situation was and two days ago we arranged to see each other soon. ""We have said from the first day that we are planning the season with him in it, he is very important for us. Our position is clear, there is no issue at the moment. We will see how we move, Oriol has a contract with us, we plan everything with him and from the outset we do not consider anything else than Oriol is still here."" The relationship between the two Catalan sides has soured since Girona's return to La Liga, which was marked by a video from the Gironistes showing a young child choosing their shirt over a Barcelona kit. Last summer also saw Barcelona prove tricky to work with as Girona tried to sign Ez Abde, Mika Marmol and Alex Collado. Former Girona president Francesc Rebled, a current socio at Barcelona, recalled to El Confidencial how Barcelona refused to help his club between 2013 and 2015. ""My personal opinion is that BarÃ§a has no interest in helping the rest of the Catalan clubs and, at that time, they had a policy of not giving us footballers,"" he explained.  ""We needed players because our economic situation was bad and only Espanyol in Catalonia helped us. We spoke with Joan Collet, the Espanyol president at the time, and he loaned us players at a good price. With BarÃ§a it was impossible and, what's worse, they gave up players to other teams in our league instead of us. ""What happens is that BarÃ§a is a vacuum cleaner and has never been interested in another team growing."""
Arsenal open talks to sign Gremio midfielder Bitello,"Jul 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-open-talks-to-sign-gremio-midfielder-bitello,"Arsenal have opened talks with Brazilian side Gremio over a deal for midfielder Bitello, sources have confirmed to 90min. Club representatives flew to Brazil earlier this week and were in attendance at Gremio's clash with Bahia on Wednesday - Bitello played the full 90 minutes. Bitello has emerged as an Arsenal target through sporting director Edu, who has used his contacts in his homeland to target him and line up a prospective deal. Sources have told 90min that it is a similar situation to that which saw them sign Gabriel Martinelli from Ituano in 2019 - a player who is under the radar in Brazil, but one who their scouts believe could make an impact in the Premier League. feed It is believed Gremio are prepared to accept a deal worth Â£8.5m including potential profit from any future sale. Talks are ongoing but sources believe a deal could be struck this week. The 23-year-old is an attacking midfielder, but can play all over the frontline or in midfield. 90min has been told that he is not dissimilar in his style of play to former Arsenal winger Willian. Arsenal are working on a move for Bitello having already made major strides in this summer's transfer market. They have confirmed the arrival of Kai Havertz, while deals for Declan Rice and Jurrien Timber will be announced shortly."
Jorginho responds to unrest over Declan Rice and Jurrien Timber deals,"Jul 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jorginho-responds-to-unrest-over-declan-rice-and-jurrien-timber-deals,"Jorginho says the Arsenal squad have no clue when the signings of Declan Rice and Jurrien Timber will be announced. The Gunners have confirmed the arrival of Kai Havertz from Chelsea while deals are close to completion for England and Netherlands internationals Rice and Timber. A British record Â£105m transfer for Rice has been agreed with West Ham after Arsenal saw off competition from Manchester City, while a full agreement for defender Timber which could ultimately be worth around â¬47m has also been reached. However, the two moves are yet to be confirmed and Jorginho, himself a January arrival from Chelsea earlier this year, told fans on social media he is in the dark over when the two newbies will touch down at the Emirates. feed When asked by a supporter on The Residency: ""Jorginho, when are Rice and Timber joining?"" The Italy international replied: ""Good question. No idea."" With Granit Xhaka off to Bayer Leverkusen and the future of Thomas Partey up in the air after a mixed campaign, Rice is expected to fit straight into Arsenal's starting XI. The Europa Conference League winner could partner Martin Odegaard and Kai Havertz in midfield, though the Gunners remain interested in bringing in another midfielder. Mikel Arteta's side are among the teams tracking Southampton starlet Romeo Lavia. The Belgium international was a bright spark in Southampton's dire 2022/23 season and is expected to depart St. Mary's with Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Newcastle also interested. The Gunners had tried to swoop for Brighton's Ecuador international Moises Caicedo in January before pivoting for Jorginho, with a high price tag meaning a deal couldn't be done. Chelsea have since stepped up their interest and prepared an opening bid for the 21-year-old."
Sadio Mane targeted by Steven Gerrard's Al Ettifaq,"Jul 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/sadio-mane-targeted-by-steven-gerrard-al-ettifaq,"Bayern Munich forward Sadio Mane is a new target for Saudi Pro League side Al Ettifaq, who are managed by Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard, sources have told 90min. Mane, an Anfield icon in his own right, swapped Merseyside for Bavaria last summer following an incredibly successful six-year spell with the Reds. He was tipped to hit those same heights at the Allianz Arena, and while Bayern just about managed to win an 11th-successive Bundesliga title, Mane underperformed and found himself at the centre of controversy when he got into a fight with Leroy Sane towards the end of the season. In 38 games across all competitions, Mane scored 12 goals and added six assists for Bayern. feed 90min reported in June that Mane was wanted by clubs in the Saudi Pro League, but he was not giving any thought to a move to the Middle East. However, 90min now understands Bayern are trying to move Mane on and they see Saudi Arabia as an ideal landing spot as there is scarce interest from across Europe. Al Ettifaq, who recently appointed Gerrard as manager and want to sign Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, want to challenge the league's PIF-owned clubs - Al Ahli, Al Ittihad, Al Hilal and Al Nassr - for Mane. In addition to Mane and Henderson, Al Ettifaq remain in talks with Aston Villa over the signing of another ex-teammate of Gerrard's - Philippe Coutinho. The Brazilian emerged as one of the former midfielder's first transfer targets upon taking the job."
Vitor Roque's agent claims Man Utd & Tottenham launched 'â¬100m hijack bids' before Barcelona move,"Jul 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/vitor-roque-agent-man-utd-tottenham-100m-hijack-bids-before-barcelona-move,"The agent of new Barcelona signing Vitor Roque has claimed that both Manchester United and Tottenham tried to hijack the striker's move to Camp Nou with bids worth close to â¬100m. Roque has signed up with Barcelona and will join the reigning Spanish champions next summer after they agreed to a deal which could be worth over â¬60m if all add-ons and bonuses are triggered. After the 18-year-old was unveiled as the latest Blaugrana signing, his agent made an appearance on the Charla Podcast in which he made the huge claim that both United and Tottenham had lodged enormous bids for Roque. ""I can confirm that English clubs tried to hijack the Vitor Roque deal,"" agent Andre Cury said. ""Tottenham and Manchester United sent important bids, way better than BarÃ§a. They were worth more than â¬100m in total. ""However, his career plan is well defined and we opted for Barcelona. Now is not the time to look at the money."" feed Despite Cury's claims, 90min understands that Arsenal were the only side to ever make a significant push for Roque, but the Gunners turned to other targets months ago when it became clear that the Brazilian was only focused on Barcelona. Chelsea were also known to be interested in Roque as part of their ramped-up scouting of South America, but no formal offer was ever made. Roque will remain in Brazil with Athletico Paranaense for the next 12 months before moving to Catalonia to link up with Xavi's side. The Blaugrana boss has already added Ilkay Gundogan and Inigo Martinez on free transfers this summer and is still looking for a new right-back and two new midfielders, with replacing Sergio Busquets now his top priority."
Jordan Henderson considering Steven Gerrard reunion at Al Ettifaq,"Jul 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jordan-henderson-considering-steven-gerrard-reunion-al-ettifaq,"Jordan Henderson is considering an approach from Saudi Arabian side Al Ettifaq over a move away from Liverpool this summer, 90min understands. Al Ettifaq have recently unveiled Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard as their new manager and the boss is now working to try and bolster his new squad to keep up with the wave of aggressive recruitment from across the Saudi Pro League. Gerrard is pushing to convince Henderson to make the move to Al Ettifaq and club officials have laid out their proposal for the 33-year-old Liverpool captain, who is understood to be considering the offer on the table. 90min understands that Henderson has not yet ruled out a move to Al Ettifaq and Liverpool are giving the midfielder time to make a decision. Reds manager Jurgen Klopp has, however, made it clear to Henderson that he does not want to part ways with the England international and he remains a big part of his plans. feed Should Henderson decide to accept Al Ettifaq's offer, 90min understands Liverpool will not stand in his way and will enter into negotiations with the Saudi side to try and thrash out a deal. Henderson still has two years remaining on the four-year contract he signed back in 2021 and so an agreement would have to be reached over a transfer fee if he is to leave Liverpool this summer. His 12 years at Anfield have yielded 492 appearances in all competitions, with Henderson wearing the captain's armband in Liverpool's famous Champions League and Premier League triumphs in 2019 and 2020 respectively. However, Henderson saw his role in the first team limited last season, making just 23 starts in the Premier League, and the summer arrivals of Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai have only added to the competition for minutes in Klopp's midfield."

Why do top clubs want to sign Levi Colwill?,"Jul 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/why-top-clubs-want-sign-levi-colwill-chelsea-liverpool-brighton,"Following a sparkling European Under-21 Championship with England, the spotlight has shone even brighter on young Chelsea defender Levi Colwill. By winning the tournament with the Three Lions and impressing thoroughly along the way, the Blues will now have to fend off interest from other top clubs for the centre-back. The 20-year-old spent last season on loan at Brighton and made such a positive impression at the Amex that the Seagulls are desperate to bring him to the south coast permanently. Liverpool have since also joined the race for Colwill. They are ready to make an offer of their own and are confident they will be successful. New Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino is set to hold talks with the phenom when he returns from international duty. However, Colwill is yet to be persuaded his long-term future is at Stamford Bridge. With what comes next uncertain, why are top clubs interested in signing Colwill? A versatile player capable of playing at centre-back and left-back, Colwill has all the attributes of a top modern defender. His pace, physicality and tactical understanding makes him a highly-desirable asset for any top club interested in playing on the front foot. One of Colwill's key strengths is his technical ability, boasting a great passing range. He ranked in the top 10% of Premier League centre-backs per 90 last season for progressive passing distance, passes into the final third and key passes, making him a perfect candidate for teams wanting to play out from defence. Colwill was often comfortable stepping into midfield from defence for the Seagulls and helping beat the press, a particularly important attribute in the Premier League.  During the U21 Euros, the centre-back also showed his ability when out of possession with his wonderful reading of the game and sensing of danger. His strength and stature stood out, and in the final itself against Spain he was one of the team's star performers. Obviously, any club interested in signing Colwill will be paying for potential with the 20-year-old still far from the finished article. However, he has solid foundations on which to build and could be a key man for club and country for years to come. Club Appearances Passing accuracy Tackles + interceptions Goals + assists Brighton 22 88.2% 23 2 Huddersfield 30 77.8% 88 3 READ THE LATEST PREMIER LEAGUE NEWS, RUMOURS & GOSSIP feed Of course, Chelsea are incredibly eager to hold on to Colwill, whose contract runs until 2025 at Stamford Bridge.  Pochettino views the defender as a key player for Chelsea now and in the future and the club do not want to lose yet another top English academy graduate. The Blues' unwillingness to sell has resulted in the club whacking an approximately Â£68m price tag on their starlet, a fee which is likely to put off any prospective bidders.  Brighton have already seen one bid rejected and are expected to up their offer again, although it will almost certainly not be enough to convince Chelsea to sell. The fact that the Seagulls are so keen on Colwill having seen his progress first-hand last season is a good sign for the left-sided centre-back. Liverpool have also entered the race to sign Colwill and are themselves eager to reinforce their defensive line, specifically looking for a young left-footed centre-back capable of covering in a back three. Colwill ticks all the boxes for the Reds but that enormous price tag will likely prove a stumbling block for Jurgen Klopp's side. While the strongest possibility is Colwill continuing at Chelsea, talks with Pochettino may prove crucial in the youngster's decision."
Why would Man Utd want Rasmus Hojlund?,"Jul 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/why-would-man-utd-want-rasmus-hojlund,"It's amazing the difference a year can make in football. This time last summer very few had heard of Rasmus Hojlund, now Atalanta are demanding up to â¬80m for their young forward. Having only signed for Atalanta from Sturm Graz in Austria last summer, Hojlund's rise in Bergamo has been meteoric. Arriving from relative obscurity, the 20-year-old continually wowed in Serie A and now has one of the biggest clubs in world football knocking at his door. That club is Manchester United, whose frantic search for a new striker this summer has seen them barking up many different trees already. Now one of the names at the forefront of the Red Devils' search, the Dane wants to move to Old Trafford, but there is still talking to be done between the clubs. Why are Atalanta slapping such a hefty price tag on Hojlund and why do United want him so badly? Following Cristiano Ronaldo's mid-season exit from Old Trafford last year, Erik ten Hag was left with very few options up top.  Marcus Rashford was in fine goalscoring form but was far more prolific cutting in from the left-hand side, while the emergency loan of Wout Weghorst and the consistent injuries to Anthony Martial leave the Red Devils without a genuine focal point - Jadon Sancho was even used as a 'false nine' as United commended their pre-season schedule against Leeds in Oslo. Ten Hag needs to remedy this issue during the transfer window and Hojlund could be the man he turns to.  The 20-year-old is understandably inexperienced but impressed in the 32 games he played at Atalanta last season in Serie A. He contributed nine goals and four assists, all while having to share minutes with the more senior Luis Muriel and Duvan Zapata. Standing at 6ft2in, Hojlund is a strong physical presence despite his tender age and teams pace with strength to great effect. His tally of six goals in six games with Denmark also highlights his clinical edge, but the most exciting aspect is still largely his potential. The former FC Kobenhavn player has plenty of room to improve and provides Ten Hag with more of a development project than the likes of Dusan Vlahovic and Victor Osimhen. However, the reward could be significantly greater in the long run. Club Appearances Goals Assists Atalanta 34 10 4 Sturm Graz 21 12 4 FC Kobenhavn 32 5 0 Denmark 6 6 0 READ THE LATEST MAN UTD NEWS, TRANSFER RUMOURS & GOSSIP feed 90min understands that United have been in talks with Atalanta over a deal for Hojlund, but there is still a considerable gulf between what the Red Devils are willing to pay and what La Dea want. United want to pay no more than Â£51m at a push for Hojlund, while Atalanta are wanting Â£60m or more. Hojlund is keen on a move to Old Trafford as he sets his sights on Champions League and Premier League football next season and may have to force his way out of the Stadio Atleti Azzurri d'Italia.  Ideally, United would like to add two number nines this summer - a young prospect with huge potential and a more experienced forward. Hojlund would tick the box of the former, but budgetary concerns mean signing both attackers may not be possible. "
Paris Saint-Germain interested in signing Joao Felix,"Jul 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/paris-saint-germain-interested-in-signing-joao-felix,"Paris Saint-Germain are working on a deal to bring Joao Felix to the French capital, sources have confirmed to 90min. Felix began pre-season training back at Atletico Madrid this week, and in a meeting with club officials he confirmed that he is keen to leave the club this summer. 90min understands that Felix is particularly keen on a move to Paris Saint-Germain in order to work with new manager Luis Enrique.  Enrique has just arrived at the Parc des Princes, replacing Christophe Galtier, and sources have confirmed that he has shortlisted Felix as a potential summer signing for the Ligue 1 champions.  As it stands, Atletico Madrid are demanding around â¬90m for the forward's services, having paid more than â¬120m to sign him from Benfica in 2019. 90min understands that PSG would prefer a loan deal, ideally with an option to buy, but Atleti would want an obligation to buy attached.  feed Felix spent the second half of last season on loan at Chelsea - a loan which did not include an obligation to buy - and the club opted not to take up the opportunity to sign the Portuguese forward outright as he did not fit in with new manager Mauricio Pochettino's plans at Stamford Bridge.  Other English clubs have been linked and 90min understands that Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Newcastle United and Aston Villa have all been kept informed about Felix's situation by his representatives, however another loan to the Premier League is unlikely at this stage.  Felix's fellow countryman Bernardo Silva has also been heavily linked with a move to PSG, with 90min reported recently that the club are set to make a new bid for the Man City man now that Enrique has been appointed.

The 10 most expensive Spanish footballers of all time,"Jul 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/10-most-expensive-spanish-footballers-all-time,"What is it with Chelsea and expensive Spaniards? What's the tapas like in west London? Now, this list may come across as a condemnation of the Blues' transfer policy, but we promise you it's not. Chelsea's penchant for erroneously spending big money on Spanish folk is just a by-product of the top ten most expensive Spaniards of all time. Did we mention that Chelsea dominate this list? Clearly the tapas wasn't authentic enough for Mata around Stamford Bridge as he switched Chelsea for Man Utd midway through the 2013/14 campaign.The archetypal #10 was a fully fledged Premier League star and a Champions League winner with the Blues, but he opted for a new challenge which eventually returned silverware after an underwhelming start.Mata, then United's record signing, spent eight years in Manchester and came ever so close to racking up 200 Premier League appearances with the Red Devils. The Valencia maestro was one of numerous big-money signings made by Lazio during Sergio Cragnotti's ownership.Mendieta became the sixth most expensive player ever in 2002 when the arrived in the Eternal City, but his sole season at Lazio proved a disappointment. The Spaniard was outshone by the likes of Pavel Nedved and Juan Sebastian Veron and was loaned out for the next two seasons before joining Middlesbrough in 2004.Now that's a fall from grace. A transfer which came somewhat out of the blue. Ferran was seemingly only at the start of his journey with Manchester City but the Citizens opted to cut his time in the Premier League short when Barcelona came calling and signed the versatile wide man for â¬55m.City made a tidy profit on the Spaniard, who's failed to cement himself as a regular starter in Catalonia. It's not the first time we'll question Chelsea's recruitment on this list.Torres at his very best was a force to be reckoned with, but that headband donning phenom who terrorised defences at the start of his Premier League career was no more by the time the Blues splurged â¬58.5m to sign him from Liverpool.Sapped of pace and often low on confidence, Torres was not the striker Chelsea thought they were signing. Nevertheless, the Spaniard scored 45 times in 175 games for the Blues and produced one of the sport's most iconic moments at Camp Nou during Chelsea's journey to unthinkable Champions League glory in 2012. Costa was nothing short of a menace during his Chelsea pomp and was the club's leading man (Eden Hazard aside) in two Premier League title triumphs.Antonio Conte initially got the very best out of the tempestuous forward during his first season at the helm, but their combustible relationship unsurprisingly culminated in a divorce.A delayed transfer meant Costa eventually returned to Atletico for â¬60m in January 2018. feed The Basque Country tax. City were forced to pay a whopping â¬65m to sign Laporte from Athletic Club in 2018.However, the club's hefty investment proved shrewd as Laporte quickly settled in Manchester and proved a crucial addition to Pep's project.His ball-playing capacity elevated City's build-up and helped them to multiple league titles, although his prominence at the Etihad waned during their treble-winning 2022/23 campaign. Cucurella has come a long way from being Jose Borderlas' Duracell bunny down Getafe's left flank.Brighton proved to be the perfect destination for the spritely Spaniard, who rapidly evolved into a full-back coveted by City and Chelsea. The Blues won the bidding war, paying a eye-watering â¬65.3m to bring him to Stamford Bridge.While Cucurella had impressed on the south coast, almost everybody believed Chelsea had overpaid the odds and those doubts were vindicated as the versatile defender endured a tough debut season. While Conte insisted Morata was a man you'd like your daughter to marry, the Italian wasn't particularly pleased that the Spaniard ended up as his leading man following Diego Costa's exit.Conte was desperate for Romelu Lukaku, but the Blues missed out as United acquired the Belgian.Morata was regarded as a fine alternative nonetheless and his maiden season at the club was pretty impressive. However, the Spaniard's form quickly fell off a cliff and he struggled to regain any sort of confidence once self-doubt started to arise. City were proactive in their search for Fernandinho's successor, acquiring a midfielder more out of the Pep Guardiola mould.The Citizens signed Rodri from Atletico Madrid for â¬70m in 2020 and the Spaniard quickly grew into one of Pep's lynchpins.Rodri has long been regarded as one of the very best in his position and his excellent 2022/23 campaign concluded with the winner in the Champions League final. Remember that pesky Basque Country tax.Chelsea not only made Kepa the most expensive Spaniard ever when they signed him from Athletic Club in 2018, but he also became the most expensive goalkeeper ever. The mammoth fee meant it was always going to be hard for Kepa to live up to expectations and he's endured some really tough spells in west London. For a while it seemed as if his Premier League career was up, but a recent resurgence saw him reclaim his number one status from Edouard Mendy. A decent enough keeper who was never worth the monster sum paid by the Blues.  Rank Player Joined Fee 1. Kepa Arrizabalaga Chelsea â¬80m 2. Rodri Man City â¬70m 3. Alvaro Morata Chelsea â¬66m 4.

Joan Laporta reveals Barcelona's plans for new signing Vitor Roque,"Jul 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/joan-laporta-barcelona-plans-new-signing-vitor-roque,"Barcelona club president Joan Laporta has confirmed plans for when fans expect to see new signing Vitor Roque play.  La Blaugrana confirmed the â¬40m signing of Roque from Athletico Paranaense on Wednesday, fending off interest from the likes of Arsenal, Chelsea and Bayern Munich in order to secure the highly-rated youngster's signature.  The 18-year-old has signed a long-term deal at the club but will remain at Paranaense until 2024, something which was confirmed by president Laporta during an interview with Mundo Deportivo. ""We have this feasibility plan and it is scheduled for January or June unless the foreseen circumstances improve, although they could still occur,"" Laporta said. feed Laporta also revealed what he expectes of Roque, who recently became Brazil's youngest ever player - beating a record previously held by Ronaldo. ""Goals.Â It is a very own style.Â You can't compare it to Ronaldo or Romario, he is a player who gets into the penalty box and can shoot with both feet anywhere inside that area,"" he added. ""I can't say that he is a Romario because he plays differently than a Romario, which was from a cartoon.Â He has a lot of power and although he is very young, he can be compared to Ronaldo, who we had with a spectacular force of nature.Â He is powerful and he is Brazilian."""
Man City players who could leave before the transfer window deadline,"Jul 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-city-players-could-leave-transfer-window-deadline-2023,"Pep Guardiola will be devastated to see any of his Manchester City treble-winners leave the club this summer, but it may be surprisingly difficult for the Spaniard to keep some of his favourites at the Etihad.  However, for the good of competitive football, it might be a blessing if some of City's stars make an exit in the transfer window. Ilkay Gundogan has already left for Barcelona, while a host of Guardiola's other stalwarts have been rumoured with transfers elsewhere. The departures of Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko to Arsenal last summer also proved costly in City's pursuit of the Premier League and Pep will be keen not to give any of his other rivals a leg-up this time around. Here are some of those who could leave the Cityzens this transfer window. One of those who has missed out on the plaudits received by City's treble-winners is Joao Cancelo. The 29-year-old left the Etihad halfway through last season to join Bayern Munich on loan after falling out with Guardiola. Having made 17 Premier League appearances and appeared in every Champions League group stage match for the Sky Blues, Cancelo may regret his decision to depart City in the middle of a historic season in Manchester. Having been met by a chorus of boos by Man City supporters when his Bayern side faced the Sky Blues in the Champions League quarter-final, it appears there is no way back for the once invincible Portuguese defender. While Bayern have had the option to make Cancelo's deal permanent for approximately Â£60m, the Bavarians passed up on the opportunity due to what they consider an excessive fee. However, Die Roten remain a club acutely interested in a deal for the full back but will have to barter to get a transfer over the line. Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta also holds Cancelo in high-regard having worked with him during his time at Man City, but given the positive impact of Jesus and Zinchenko at the Emirates last season, Guardiola may think twice before letting him move to north London. Barcelona are also sniffing around having already captured his former teammate Gundogan, but their financial problems would make a deal difficult to complete. Cancelo is not the only full back Bayern are interested in, with last season's Bundesliga champions also eager to sign Walker. The 33-year-old impressed last season, albeit his minutes were more closely managed, and his pace has been crucial in breaking up opposition counter-attacks with John Stones stepping into midfield. His impressive performance against Vinicius Junior in the Champions League semi-final second leg highlights how capable he remains at the highest level. With his contract set to expire next summer, City are keen to extend his current deal despite the fact that Walker is yet to make a final decision on whether he wants to stay at the Etihad. Bayern have been forthright in their attempts to woo Walker this summer as Thomas Tuchel seeks a replacement for the departing Benjamin Pavard and the England international may be keen on a change of scenery having won almost everything there is to win at City. Similarly to Cancelo, Laporte was once seen as an immovable object in the City starting lineup. His absence was so greatly felt during the 2019/20 season when his injury early in the campaign resulted in a significant drop-off in performances for the Sky Blues, helping Liverpool leapfrog City to the Premier League title. However, Laporte is now something of a luxury option for Guardiola as Nathan Ake's sensational performances have cost the Spain international his starting berth. The potential arrival of another left-sided centre-back in Josko Gvardiol from RB Leipzig could well and truly push Laporte out the exit door. 90min have already reported that, following conversations with Guardiola about a lack of game time, Laporte is now looking for a move away from the Etihad this summer. Barcelona, who are seemingly the first in line for any discontented City player, hold an interest in the 29-year-old while there are unsurprisingly suitors from Saudi Arabia. Having sealed a dream Â£45m move from Leeds United last summer, things quickly turned nightmarish for Phillips at City. The holding midfielder missed a large chunk of the campaign through injury last year and was even criticised by Guardiola for being overweight. As a result, the 27-year-old made just 21 appearances in all competitions, most of which came from the bench, and the curtain may already be closing on his disappointing City career. Guardiola is still undecided about what to do with Phillips but given the significant transfer fee City spent on the midfielder, it may be a rare example of when the club's recruitment team get it wrong. West Ham and Newcastle have been linked with a potential move and it feels as if a transfer may come later in the window. feed One man who Guardiola would be loathed to lose is Bernardo Silva, a man for whom the big occasion is his playground. His sensational performance in Man City's 4-0 victory over Real Madrid last season was one of the highlights of the campaign, scoring twice and giving Eduardo Camavinga nightmares. The 28-year-old is one of Guardiola's key foot soldiers and his loss would be sorely felt by the Sky Blues should he depart. Paris Saint-Germain's new coach Luis Enrique is eager to work with the attacking midfielder, while there has also been significant interest from Saudi Arabia. Unsurprisingly, Barcelona also have a long-standing admiration of Silva with City only willing to accept sizeable offers for the Portugal international. Silva has made 306 appearances over a trophy-laden six-year career at the Etihad. Despite his slightly waning influence on Man City, now normally being reserved for more simplistic fixtures, Mahrez still managed 28 combined goals and assists in 47 games last season. On his day, he remains borderline unplayable. Knowing he is going to cut in on his wand of a left foot and unleash a powerful drive is one thing, stopping it is another thing altogether. His consistency and quality is unquestionable, but this may be the last summer in which the Sky Blues can recoup a significant amount of money for the 32-year-old before his value diminishes. Despite growing lucrative interest from Saudi Arabia, 90min understands  City are still desperate to keep hold of the Algerian winger this summer, especially if Silva departs. Without an obvious replacement for his unique skill set, Mahrez's exit would pose Guardiola a serious headache."
Ruben Loftus-Cheek reveals why he left Chelsea,"Jul 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ruben-loftus-cheek-reveals-why-he-left-chelsea,"Ruben Loftus-Cheek has admitted that a lack of game time at Chelsea led to his departure this summer. The towering midfielder ended his near 20-year association with Chelsea - having joined the youth team in 2004 - at the end of the 2022/23 season following the expiration of his contract at Stamford Bridge. Loftus-Cheek has signed a four-year deal with Milan, with the midfielder seemingly set to replace Sandro Tonali in Stefano Pioli's starting XI after he joined Newcastle United for an Italian record fee earlier this month.  feed Speaking to the press at his unveiling as a Milan player, Loftus-Cheek admitted that decided to leave the Blues due to the lack of playing time in his preferred position in midfield. ""I love the club and the fans but I wasn't feeling content with the amount I was playing and the positions I was playing in,"" he said. ""I felt I had more to give but I wasn't getting the opportunity. I feel good physically and am playing some really good football. It was a good time to move on."" The 27-year-old made 25 appearances for Chelsea during the 2022/23 campaign, with just 11 of those coming as a central midfielder. Loftus-Cheek was more regularly utilised as a right wing-back, playing that position on 14 occasions. "
Aston Villa complete signing of Pau Torres,"Jul 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/aston-villa-complete-signing-pau-torres,"Aston Villa have announced the signing of Pau Torres from Villarreal. The centre-back will reunite with Unai Emery in the West Midlands having won the Europa League together with the Yellow Submarine back in 2021. The transfer is subject to international clearance and a successful visa application. Villa have been on the hunt for squad reinforcements after securing an unlikely spot in next season's Conference League. They have now confirmed Torres as their second signing of the summer, following on from Youri Tielemans' free transfer from Leicester City. feed 90min first reported at the start of June that Torres was of interest to Villa, as well as Manchester City's Aymeric Laporte. Negotiations advanced throughout the following weeks and an agreement was reached on the final day of the month, with the Spain international granted permission to travel for a medical. Torres' move was confirmed on Wednesday after returning from his honeymoon. Villa have further plans to bring in a winger this window, but have failed in their attempts to sign Nico Williams from Athletic Club and are struggling to persuade Ferran Torres to leave Barcelona."
Fulham determined to keep Aleksandar Mitrovic & Marco Silva amid Saudi Arabia interest,"Jul 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/fulham-determined-keep-aleksandar-mitrovic-marco-silva-saudi-arabia-interest,"Fulham striker Aleksandar Mitrovic has emerged as the Saudi Pro League's latest high-profile transfer target, while his manager Marco Silva is also the subject of interest, sources have confirmed to 90min. Mitrovic proved many doubters wrong last season upon his return to the Premier League, finishing the campaign with 14 goals in 24 games. The Serbia international is contracted to Fulham until 2026 and just as is the case with Portugal midfielder Joao Palhinha, the west London outfit are not planning on losing their prized assets. 90min understands an opening offer has arrived from Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal, who tabled an initial bid worth Â£25m. But sources close to Fulham insist Mitorvic is not for sale and the bid was quickly rebuffed. It remains to be seen if Al Hilal will try again, with sources telling 90min the 28-year-old does want to move to Saudi Arabia where he has been offered a three-year deal worth more than Â£20m per season. feed 90min understands that Al Ahli also have an interest in Mitrovic, but Al Hilal are seen as the most likely option given they already have a deal in place to sign his good friend Sergej Milinkovic-Savic. While Fulham are adamant that Mitrovic will not be leaving, they are also continuing to try and persuade manager Marco Silva to reject advances from the Saudi Pro League. Silva has already rebuffed an offer earlier this summer this to move to Saudi Arabia, but 90min can confirm that efforts are still being made to land the Portuguese coach. His current deal expires in 2024 and Fulham are working hard to convince Silva to sign a new deal, but they know they are unable to hand him the kind of money on offer from Saudi Arabia. Al Ahli are believed to be the side eyeing Silva."
The 10 most expensive German footballers of all time,"Jul 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/10-most-expensive-german-footballers-all-time,"The Premier League loves a German. While Bayern Munich have tried their utmost to acquire and retain the very best Germany has to offer amid their supreme reign at the Bundesliga summit, the financial might of the English top flight has seen several players escape Die Roten's grasp. Of the ten most expensive German players of all time, six signed for Premier League clubs, while all but two have at some point in their careers strutted their stuff on English shores. Pep Guardiola made Borussia Dortmund sensation Gotze one of his first signings as Bayern boss, with the Spaniard believing the young German could develop into a majestic false nine.Gotze starred in Pep's maiden season and enjoyed a productive year two before a hamstring injury compromised his third campaign at the club. While the canny midfielder's record at Bayern was pretty impressive, he departed after three years with the prevailing feeling of 'what could've been'. PSG were so convinced by young Kehrer that they splashed out â¬37m to prise him away from Schalke, where he burst onto the scene as a teenager.The defender certainly impressed in spells at Parc des Princes as he spent four years in the French capital but his eventual sale to West Ham for â¬12m shows he didn't quite live up to the hype. There was a time when Arsenal weren't so savvy in the transfer market.While â¬41m isn't such a mammoth fee in 2023, it was significant back in 2016 when the Gunners moved for Valencia centre-back Mustafi.The 2014 World Cup winner arrived with a rather lofty reputation but his time in north London was tumultuous. Mustafi was capable of producing stellar performances against the world's best but his frequent brain fades rendered him a liability in Arsenal's backline.Nevertheless, he spent five years at the Emirates and notched over 100 Premier League appearances. Once a highly rated young Germany international, Julian Draxler's peak years have come and gone in sad fashion.Once coveted for years by Europe's elite, the precocious German playmaker's big move in 2015 wasn't overseas. He remained in the Bundesliga and signed for a Wolfsburg side seemingly on the come up after qualifying for the Champions League.Tasked with replacing Kevin De Bruyne, Draxler's 2015/16 season was by no means a disaster but many in the German media believed he failed to fulfil expectations as Wolfsburg slumped to eighth in the Bundesliga. feed Arsenal fans were the envy of the footballing world at the end of the 2013 summer transfer window. The day after Olivier Giroud scored the game's only goal to beat Tottenham in the north London derby, Real Madrid superstar Ozil was announced as a deadline day arrival.The once-in-a-generation playmaker arrived to much fanfare after excelling on the world stage at the 2010 World Cup and thrived under Jose Mourinho in the Spanish capital.Ozil was the most expensive German player ever for a few years before being overtaken. While Sane had blossomed into a frightening prospect for Premier League full backs at Man City, Bayern were undoubtedly taking a bit of a risk by signing the winger for a pretty big fee in 2020.Sane's contract situation and his long-term injury setback meant Bayern snagged him for a bargain given his value pre-injury but it took a while for the former Schalke starlet to find his feet in Bavaria.The destructive Sane that was instrumental in City's majestic 2017/18 and 2018/19 campaigns is yet to manifest consistently for the Rekordmeister. Sane joined City during Guardiola's first summer at the club and it didn't take the German long to establish himself as a protagonist in the Spaniard's project.He burst into life after a quiet debut season (reportedly hampered by a breathing issue) and starred as City became the Premier League's first centurions in 2017/18.The winger forged devastating relationships with Raheem Sterling on the opposite flank and Sergio Aguero up top, with his lightning-quick speed and direct running persistently overwhelming opposing full backs.Sane notched 47 Premier League goal contributions in 17/18 and 18/19. Seemingly destined for Liverpool after yet another marvellous season with RB Leipzig, Chelsea swooped under the Reds' nose to sign Werner ahead of the 2020/21 season.The rapid German forward was an output machine in his homeland but his woeful inefficiency meant his time in west London was a forgettable one.While a loveable figure and a Champions League winner with the Blues, Werner scored just ten Premier League goals in 56 games. New surroundings ð´âªï¸Kai Havertz at Emirates Stadium â¡ï¸ pic.twitter.com/KLTgAn6EhW A move that's raised plenty of eyebrows but you'd be silly to doubt Mikel Arteta given Arsenal's recent record on the recruitment front. While Havertz has done little in the Premier League to suggest he's worth the monster pay packet Arsenal are offering him, Arteta must be confident he can help the Germany international rediscover his potent Bayer Leverkusen touch.Arteta has already hinted Havertz's future in north London lies in midfield as the potential replacement for Granit Xhaka as the Spaniard's left-sided #8.It's a role that should get the best out of the languid space invader. It takes a lot to garner praise from former World Footballer of the Year Lothar Matthaus but Der Panzer was full of praise for blossoming Leverkusen starlet Havertz back in 2019.Matthaus labelled Havertz a future Ballon d'Or winner and later compared him to Zinedine Zidane. While such lofty praise was rational at the time, the player's time at Chelsea rendered Matthaus' projections laughable.Havertz became the most expensive German ever when Chelsea signed him off the back of a stellar Bundesliga career for â¬80m in 2020. And while he'd score the game's only goal in the 2021 Champions League final, Havertz's Chelsea career is looked upon with indifference given his inconsistency and apparent flakiness.

Saudi Pro League pushing hard to sign Riyad Mahrez,"Jul 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/saudi-pro-league-eye-man-city-duo-aymeric-laporte-riyad-mahrez,"Manchester City winger Riyad Mahrez remains the subject of intense transfer interest from Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli, sources have told 90min. The 32-year-old lost his place as a starter towards the end of the 2022/23 season and was unhappy at being overlooked for Man City's wins in the FA Cup and Champions League finals, remaining an unused substitute in both fixtures. 90min revealed that Mahrez was in contact with Al Ahli towards the end of June, with the club willing to pay him Â£45m-a-year. He is open to such a move. As was the case last month though, Man City remain reluctant to let Mahrez leave, with Bernardo Silva's increasingly uncertain future a major factor. The Portugal international has asked to be granted a summer transfer and PSG are keen to make him one of Luis Enrique's first signings. Another player that is on Saudi Arabia's radar is out-of-favour Man City centre-back Aymeric Laporte. 90min previously reported that Laporte was being eyed by Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur, but Man City have not received any major offers from clubs in Europe. With interest from across the continent yet to be firmed up, Man City are ready to sell him to willing buyers from Saudi Arabia, with Al Ahli ready to offer him an exit route. Al Ahli are also targeting Napoli midfielder Piotr Zielinski, who is wanted by Lazio as a replacement for Al Hilal-bound Sergej Milinkovic-Savic. feed"

However, Roque was always intent on joining BarÃ§a and a â¬40m fee was quickly agreed. La Liga's champions edged closer to official confirmation earlier this month and have now confirmed the teenager's arrival, stating: ""The player is expected to join the club for the 2024/25 season and will sign a contract until the 2030/31 season with a buy out clause of 500 million euros.""

Liverpool ready to make move for Levi Colwill,"Jul 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-ready-to-make-move-levi-colwill,"Liverpool are ready to make an offer for Chelsea centre-back Levi Colwill, 90min understands. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Liverpool are confident they can lure Colwill away from Stamford Bridge, despite Chelsea's insistence that he is not for sale. Colwill, who was one of the stars of England's European Under-21 Championship success this summer, impressed hugely on loan at Brighton & Hove Albion last season. The Seagulls have already failed with a couple of bids to land him on a permanent basis. Chelsea have stated since January, when Brighton first floated the idea of a permanent deal, that they are not looking to sell the defender. However, 90min has been told that Colwill is far from convinced that his long-term future should be at Chelsea despite their insistence that he will get chances to prove himself this coming season. Colwill's current deal is due to expire in 2025 and Chelsea are looking to extend it, but as it stands talks have not advanced. Chelsea have made it clear to their squad that players unwilling to sign new deals will be sold. highlighted by the departures of Mason Mount and Mateo Kovacic this summer. Liverpool have been focussing on overhauling their midfield this summer and with Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai already signed, they are now also looking at defensive options and a new centre-half is in their sights and Colwill is in their sights. feed They had shown an interest in Wolfsburg's Micky van de Ven - who is in talks with Tottenham - but Colwill has emerged as their top target and they believe he wants to move to Anfield.  Colwill stated earlier this week that he was still considering his options but insisted that he wants to be playing regularly, which is a concern for him at Chelsea.

Bayern Munich prepare record bid for Harry Kane,"Jul 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-prepare-record-bid-harry-kane,"Bayern Munich are readying a third bid for Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane worth north of â¬80m, 90min understands. The Bavarians are continuing their chase for the England captain, who they have courted for much of the last 12 months despite Spurs' insistence he will not be sold. Kane's contract expires in 2024 and he has so far resisted signing a fresh deal at Tottenham following their worst Premier League finish in 14 years. 90min reported on Sunday that Bayern followed up on their initial offer for Kane with a second bid of â¬80m - the same amount they spent on club-record signing Lucas Hernandez back in 2019. However, Tottenham stood firm and knocked it back. Sources have confirmed to 90min that this has not deterred Bayern and they are now ready to smash their transfer record in order to bring Kane to the Allianz Arena, with a third bid to be submitted in the coming days. Nevertheless, Tottenham are adamant that they will not even entertain talk of a deal for Kane and they are likely to reject any further advances from Bayern. Spurs' new head coach, Ange Postecoglou, will meet with Kane for the first time on Wednesday when he returns to Hotspur Way for pre-season training. feed 90min understands that Tottenham are hopeful that Kane will buy into Postecoglou's plans for a rebuild and help convince him to extend his stay at the club. Speaking at his introductory press conference on Monday, Postecoglou admitted he is currently unconcerned by talk of Kane leaving the club. ""If I say itâs annoying me, it would be misleading - it doesnât register. I always believe that yo'âre much better trying to understand what a situation is through your own eyes,"" Postecoglou said.

""Nothing's landed on my desk at this moment from anybody at the club to say there's a decision to be made there. Not even close to that, so because of that I'm looking forward to having Harry here on Wednesday."" Postecoglou added: ""I don't think it's my role to sit there and treat people in a manner because of their circumstances. ""I treat everyone the same. Harry is already an important figure in the history of this football club. He's one of the premier players in the world. I want him here and I want to make this club successful. I'm certain he wants that as well. ""It's not going to be a conversation where we come out with some kind of understanding. I just want to introduce myself and I want to know what he wants to happen to make this football club successful then we'll go out there on the training ground and make it happen."""

Arda Guler: Joan Laporta explains why Barcelona accepted defeat to Real Madrid,"Jul 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arda-guler-joan-laporta-why-barcelona-accepted-defeat-real-madrid,"Barcelona president Joan Laporta has claimed the club pulled out of the race to sign Turkish teenager Arda Guler after Real Madrid made the 18-year-old an enormous financial offer. Guler's Fenerbahce contract had a â¬17.5m release clause and both Barcelona and Real Madrid were prepared to trigger it, and the Blaugrana even thought they had a deal wrapped up before Guler confirmed his decision to move to the Bernabeu instead.

Laporta later confirmed that Barcelona's stance was designed to ensure they 'do not go back there', referring to the period of financial woes brought about under Bartomeu. Barcelona are in the market for a number of reinforcements this summer and, when asked how they could spend the money initially set aside for Guler, Laporta confirmed that manager Xavi has made his demands perfectly clear. ""As the coach has requested, a right-back and two midfielders are missing,"" he explained. ""I don't think it's going to cost us much. In fact, there are several possibilities, several options. Xavi has told us that he can now compete but we do have to look for a player to occupy the place left by Busi [Sergio Busquets] and to be able to play in a two."""
Man City rule out Julian Alvarez departure despite Bayern Munich interest,"Jul 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-city-rule-out-julian-alvarez-departure-despite-bayern-munich-interest,"Manchester City officials have laughed off suggestions they could be willing to part ways with striker Julian Alvarez this summer, 90min understands. Bayern Munich have voiced an interest in Alvarez, who had the unenviable task of being backup to Erling Haaland at the Etihad Stadium last season. 23-year-old Alvarez, who is also seen as one of the game's top young strikers, bagged 17 goals in 49 appearances in his debut season in Manchester, but fewer than half of those outings came as a starter and several teams have been tipped to offer the Argentina international more regular football. However, sources have confirmed to 90min that City are delighted with Alvarez's impact and are not entertaining losing him this summer, either permanently or temporarily, while the World Cup winner is also understood to be happy at the club. Alvarez's feelings towards his situation at City were made clear in March, when he signed a new five-year contract, and there remains a mutual desire to continue working together at the Etihad. feed City are braced for the possible departures of both Bernardo Silva and Riyad Mahrez this summer. The former is wanted by both Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain, while the latter is of significant interest in Saudi Arabia. Amid concerns about a potential shake-up of their forward line, City are not prepared to part ways with Alvarez and sources have stressed to 90min that this stance was taken well before interest in Silva and Mahrez emerged. Bayern Munich have been made well aware that there is no chance of signing Alvarez this summer and, with a move for Tottenham's Harry Kane also a non-starter, the German champions have begun searching elsewhere. Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic, who has been mentioned in talks with Chelsea, if of interest to Bayern alongside Eintracht Frankfurt's Randal Kolo Muani."
Transfer notebook: Everton eye Weghorst; Newcastle clear out; Reijnders nears AC Milan,"Jul 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/transfer-notebook-everton-weghorst-newcastle-reijnders-ac-milan-11-7-23,"Everton manager Sean Dyche is eyeing a reunion with former Manchester United loanee Wout Weghorst, who he signed during his time at Burnley. The 30-year-old is back at Turf Moor after spending six months on loan at Old Trafford, but is expected to move on once more despite the Clarets' promotion back to the Premier League. Dyche signed Weghorst to a three-and-a-half year contract in January 2022 - only to lose his job three months later as Burnley attempted to stave off the threat of relegation - and is interested in linking up again at Goodison Park. The Dutch striker also has interest in Turkey, where he spent the first half of last season on loan. Werder Bremen's Niklas Fullkrug, top scorer in the Bundesliga last season alongside Christopher Nkunku, is another long-term target for Everton - he also has interest from Fiorentina - while Ashley Young is expected to rebuff interest from Sheffield United, Luton and Burnley to join as a free agent. Outgoings wise, Everton are ready to listen to offers for Demarai Gray amid interest from a number of Premier League clubs and also from the Saudi Pro League. Crystal Palace, West Ham and Brentford are keeping an eye on Gray's situation on Merseyside, with the club already looking at potential alternatives - Leeds' Willy Gnonto among those considered. Newcastle are continuing to work on the signing of Leicester forward Harvey Barnes, whose arrival may spell the end of Allan Saint-Maximin's career on Tyneside. But after signing Sandro Tonali from AC Milan, manager Eddie Howe is now focusing his efforts on shifting a number of squad players. Club captain Jamaal Lascelles is among a number of players the Magpies are willing to move on, with Jeff Hendrick, Matt Ritchie, Isaac Hayden, Karl Darlow, Loris Karius, Ryan Fraser and Javier Manquillo also available. Nottingham Forest and Fulham are leading the chase for Manchester City's England Under-21 centre-back hero Taylor Harwood-Bellis - a star of Burnley's Premier League promotion campaign last year. Harwood-Bellis has just one year remaining on his City contract and is yet to agree an extension, which may also tempt long-term admirers West Ham and Newcastle into making a move. Burnley may also come back in for the 21-year-old, reuniting the player with Vincent Kompany. Young City team-mate Callum Doyle is set to sign a new contract at the Etihad Stadium before heading out on loan to Leicester, He has spent the last two seasons on loan at Sunderland and Coventry, achieving promotion with the former before losing in last season's play-off final with the latter. Burnley have added Dara O'Shea and Jordan Beyer to their first team ranks this summer, but are keen to conclude more business. Mike Tresor, a 24-year-old attacking midfielder at Genk, and Sunderland winger Jack Clarke, formerly of Tottenham, are both of interest and talks have been held over bringing both players to Lancashire. AZ Alkmaar midfielder Tijjani Reijnders is pushing to complete a move to Serie A giants AC Milan, with personal terms already agreed. The two clubs are now looking to thrash out a deal likely to be worth in excess of â¬20m. Viktor Gyokeres, the star of Coventry's push for promotion to the Premier League last season, is to spurn Premier League advances to join Portuguese giants Sporting CP. The 25-year-old Swede scored 21 goals last season, and will now compete against Europe's best in the Champions League. West Ham are interested in Real Betis central defender Luiz Felipe but are yet to progress talks to an advanced stage. The Hammers are in the market for a new centre-back after losing Craig Dawson to Wolves in January - Kurt Zouma, Thilo Kehrer, Nayef Aguerd and Angelo Ogbonna are David Moyes' current options. Talks are continuing with Juventus over Swiss midfielder Denis Zakaria, with West Ham ideally looking to complete a loan deal with option to buy - the Turin giants would prefer to sanction a permanent sale or a loan with obligation to purchase."
Napoli president claims only one club can afford Victor Osimhen,"Jul 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/napoli-president-claims-only-one-club-can-afford-victor-osimhen,"Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis has suggested there is only one club in the world with the money to prise Victor Osimhen away from Stadio Diego Armando Maradona this summer. Napoli took a punt on a 21-year-old Osimhen in 2020 after the Nigerian had spent just a single season with Lille and completed only his second full campaign as a first-team player anywhere. But they have been repaid handsomely for their investment, â¬70m rising to â¬80m, seeing Osimhen score 28 goals across his first two seasons and then hit 31 in his third alone. As many as 26 of those goals came in Serie A as Napoli collected a first Scudetto in 33 years last season. But Osimhen's starring role has brought him to the attention of some of Europe's biggest spenders, with Chelsea, Manchester United and Real Madrid all in need of a new 'number nine'. De Laurentiis, known all over world football as a tough negotiator, has been pretty consistent in his message throughout the ongoing transfer saga â the idea that Osimhen is only for sale in the event of a monstrous bid. feed Already this week, the president suggested that Osimhen will be staying put unless a 'more than indecent proposal' arrives at his door. In that scenario, Napoli would have no issue cashing in and searching for their next gem to polish, something they seem to have an outstanding knack for. 90min understands that Napoli value Osimhen at â¬150m and that no club is currently willing to meet that asking price. Publicly, however, De Laurentiis is setting his valuation even higher, and claims that only Paris Saint-Germain have the financial power to get a deal done. Manchester United are known to be operating on a budget with limitations and have already spent big on Mason Mount, with Andre Onana soon also expected to arrive for another big fee. Similarly, Real Madrid have committed up to â¬134m on Jude Bellingham, while Chelsea are watching the pennies more carefully than last season and are selling as many players as they buy. ""The only club that could afford Victor Osimhen is Paris Saint-Germain,"" De Laurentiis told Mediaset in Italy. ""If [PSG president] Nasser Al Khelaifi wants to send in a bid around â¬200mâ¦we wait and we see what happens. I personally think that Victor will stay here."""
Moises Caicedo admits he 'cannot say no' to Chelsea transfer,"Jul 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/moises-caicedo-admits-he-cannot-say-no-to-chelsea-transfer,"Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo has confessed he would not be able to reject a move to Chelsea this summer. Caicedo is the Blues' top target to replenish their midfield following the summer departures of Mason Mount, Mateo Kovacic, N'Golo Kante and Ruben Loftus-Cheek, and the Blues have long been in talks with Brighton over a summer deal. The sticking point has been Brighton's price tag of Â£100m which was drawn from Declan Rice's imminent move to Arsenal. The West Ham midfielder has commanded a fee of Â£105m and Brighton do not believe Caicedo should be much cheaper. Negotiations between the two clubs have proven difficult but Chelsea would seemingly not face the same difficulties in talks with Caicedo, who conceded he would be unable to turn the Blues down this summer. ""It's a big team, that's true,"" he told Maria Jose Flores when asked about Chelsea's interest. ""A very historic team and I can't say no, because it's a very big, historic, beautiful team.  ""The city as well is beautiful. It's got everything beautiful."" feed Brighton have expressed an interest in seeing Chelsea offer centre-back Levi Colwill as part of any bid for Caicedo but the Blues have made it abundantly clear that they are not entertaining such an idea. Colwill shone last season on loan at Brighton and the Seagulls are one of a number of sides to have enquired about his availability this summer, including both Liverpool and Manchester City, but Chelsea's stance has always been the same. Colwill is due to report back for pre-season with Chelsea in the coming days and will speak with manager Mauricio Pochettino about his future at the club, having spoken openly during the summer about his desire to see regular minutes next season. ""Iâve got to play at the end of the day,"" he told reporters after his triumphant European campaign with England Under-21s. Chelsea have a number of midfielders on their radar this summer but are currently focused on Caicedo, although club officials have not yet ruled out a move for a second midfielder as well."
Fred considering Man Utd future amid interest from Fulham & Saudi Pro League,"Jul 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/fred-man-utd-future-interest-fulham-saudi-pro-league,"Manchester United midfielder Fred is considering his future at Old Trafford amid interest from other clubs, 90min understands. The Brazilian midfielder joined United in June 2018 but fell out of favour under current manager Erik ten Hag in the final months of last season, starting only two Premier League matches under the Dutchman in the aftermath of the team's 7-0 defeat to Liverpool at Anfield. United's signing of Mason Mount this month has pushed Fred, now 30, further down the pecking order and he is weighing up his options with a regular first team place likely hard to come by in the new campaign. Ten Hag would also ideally like to sign another midfielder before the transfer window closes, with Fiorentina's Sofyan Amrabat of interest. Fred is understood by 90min not to be in United's long-term plans, and the club are willing to let him leave for the right price during this transfer window. United are hopeful they can recoup between Â£20m-Â£25m in any potential sale, and are asking for towards the top end of that price range as it stands. Fulham are interested, but value Fred at under Â£15m - far below United's current valuation. The player was seen speaking to Fulham manager Marco Silva outside Old Trafford following the final league fixture of last season, where the two sides met. Fred has recently changed agents and has other options to leave - with clubs in the Saudi Pro League potential candidates to sign him as they continue to sweep up high-profile players from across Europe. Fred's former United teammate Paul Pogba is of strong interest to Al Ahli and Al Ittihad, where N'Golo Kante and Karim Benzema are among the primary names to have already made the move. Jose Mourinho's Roma are understood to have spoken with Fred's representatives - Mourinho signed Fred at United during his spell as manager - though the 30-year-old has yet to make a decision on where to play next. feed It's understood Fred believes he can still play a part in United's team for the season ahead, and is also considering staying for another year and leaving on a free transfer in 2024, when his contract expires. Conversations with Ten Hag are expected to take place during pre-season and Fred has been named in a travelling squad to Norway for United's first pre-season fixture against Leeds on Wednesday. Fred's long-time midfield partner Scott McTominay is not in United's long-term plans either, though as it stands his options to leave United this summer are dwindling.  Brighton and Newcastle United, once keen on the Scotland international, have cooled their interest, while 90min has learned he does not currently feature high on the list of David Moyes' West Ham - who are set to confirm the Â£105m departure of club captain and midfielder Declan Rice to Arsenal in the coming days. Mourinho's Roma are monitoring the 26-year-old too but are unlikely at best to get anywhere near the price United would be looking for in any permanent sale. Both Fred and McTominay do not feature in Ten Hag's long-term plans, and once his squad is fully transitioned, but it is likely at present that at least one of the two will remain on board for the season to come."
Franck Kessie open to Barcelona exit amid Serie A & Saudi Pro League interest,"Jul 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/franck-kessie-barcelona-exit-serie-a-saudi-pro-league-interest,"Franck Kessie is open to leaving Barcelona this summer, 90min understands, amid growing interest from Serie A and the Saudi Pro League. The 26-year-old moved to Camp Nou on a four-year deal last summer, arriving from AC Milan following the expiry of his contract. Kessie became one of Milan's most influential players in his final two seasons at the club, scoring 13 Serie A goals in 2020/21 before winning the title in 2021/22, but has struggled to make the same impact in Spain. The Ivorian did score perhaps the most important goal of Barca's season - a title-deciding winner against Real Madrid - but made just seven starts in La Liga as Pedri, Frenkie de Jong and Sergio Busquets made it difficult for him to command a regular first-team place. 90min revealed in December that Kessie had already started to generate interest, but neither he or the club were interested in sanctioning an exit at that time. But with Barcelona still looking to offload players to lighten their inflated wage bill, speculation around Kessie's future has failed to die down. feed Sources have confirmed to 90min that Kessie would now be open to leaving Barca this summer, with interest in his services mounting from former club Milan, neighbourhood rivals Inter and Juventus. Serie A title holders Napoli are also keeping apprised of Kessie's situation, while there's also interest from the Saudi Pro League as well as in the Premier League. Barcelona's preference would be sell to Kessie permanently, rather than allowing him to go out on loan, which may work out favourably for the interested clubs in Saudi Arabia. The league has spent  lavishly on players this summer - PIF-backed Al Ittihad, Al Nassr, Al Alhi and Al Hilal the main landing spots - with Paul Pogba and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic the latest marquee names on the radar. As for Barcelona, they've already released Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba and Samuel Umtiti from their contracts, but president Joan Laporta is also looking to sell other first team players. Winger Ferran Torres is a leading candidate to head for the exit door, but the 23-year-old is determined to stay at the club this summer despite interest from Arsenal, Aston Villa and Newcastle."
Arsenal midfielder explains absence from pre-season training,"Jul 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-midfielder-explains-absence-pre-season-training-albert-sambi-lokonga,"Arsenal midfielder Albert Sambi Lokonga has insisted his absence from pre-season training is down to a 'small injury'. The Gunners have jetted off to Germany to begin their preparations for the new season but have travelled without Sambi Lokonga, with many fans assuming the Belgian's absence was due to the uncertainty surrounding his future. The 23-year-old, who spent the second half of last season on loan with Crystal Palace, has been linked with another move away this summer. But regardless of whether a move materialises or not, Sambi Lokonga insisted his absence from training was purely down to fitness. ""Due to a small muscular injury, I'll sadly not be part of the summer camp with the team in Germany,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""I'm focused now on my recovery to prepare the season and be ready to help the team at my fullest capacity."" feed One midfielder who is expected to join with Arsenal imminently is England Under-21 star Emile Smith Rowe. After helping the Young Lions towards glory at this summer's European Championships, Smith Rowe is expected to take just a week off and football.london state that the academy graduate will link up with Arsenal in the United States at the end of this week. The 22-year-old has put in plenty of extra work this summer, including a trip to Dubai immediately after the conclusion of the Premier League season to work on his fitness, with a view to earning a greater role in the Arsenal squad. Injuries and competition for minutes saw Smith Rowe forced to accept just 12 Premier League appearances last season, none of which came as a starter."
Enzo Fernandez reveals Paulo Dybala conversation over Chelsea transfer,"Jul 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/enzo-fernandez-reveals-paulo-dybala-conversation-chelsea-transfer,"Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez has confessed he has spoken with fellow Argentine Paulo Dybala over a possible summer switch to Stamford Bridge. Dybala's bargain release clause - â¬12m to sides outside of Serie A - has piqued the interest of a number of clubs, with Chelsea reported to have added the Roma forward to their lengthy shortlist of potential targets. Blues defender Thiago Silva recently fuelled the fire by publicly urging Dybala to make the move to Chelsea, and now teammate Fernandez has followed suit. ""I saw something about that. Weâll see. I hope he comes [to Chelsea],"" Fernandez told Ole of the links between Chelsea and Dybala. ""I talked to him and told him that Iâm waiting for him to share a barbecue or something."" feed Dybala has even been asked about the rumours but recently did his best to quash all speculation. ""Iâm motivated for pre-season. Iâm happy at Roma,"" Dybala told LaRoma24. ""I'm staying here."" Chelsea have already signed both Christopher Nkunku and Nicolas Jackson this summer, the latter of whom made his first appearance in training on Tuesday, and the Blues are still exploring their attacking options in the transfer window. Montpellier striker Elye Wahi has been discussed, perhaps in relation to sister side Strasbourg, while Lyon starlet Rayan Cherki is known to have plenty of admirers at Stamford Bridge. The current focus remains on discussing a deal for Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo, while Romelu Lukaku's desire to leave for Inter has led to drawn-out negotiations."
Chelsea among Premier League clubs taking interest in Ibrahim Adel,"Jul 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-premier-league-clubs-interest-ibrahim-adel,"Chelsea are one of a number of Premier League clubs keeping tabs on Egyptian winger Ibrahim Adel, 90min understands. The 22-year-old has long been regarded as one of African football's brightest young talents, and backed up that reputation after being named Player of the Tournament at the recent Under-23 Africa Cup of Nations. Adel, who currently plays for Pyramids in his homeland and has been capped four times by Egypt's senior team, was targeted by Belgian giants Anderlecht earlier this year, but a number of Premier League clubs have also been monitoring his progress. Indeed, 90min revealed in September last year that fellow countryman Mohamed Salah had advised Liverpool to keep an eye on Adel's development, though any move to England was off the table at the time because of issues obtaining a work permit. feed However, post-Brexit regulations adopted by the FA this summer means that Adel, or any other player, does not need to meet the former points threshold set by the Governing Body Endorsement criteria. Instead, up to two players - who previously would not have qualified for a work permit - can be signed, and in future years up to four players can arrive in one season depending on how many homegrown players a club has used. Adel's new found eligibility is understood to have piqued the interest of a number of Premier League and Championship clubs, with sources telling 90min that Chelsea and Newcastle are among those to have expressed an interest, alongside Brighton, Brentford, Aston Villa, West Ham, Burnley and Southampton. Chelsea's interest is believed to emanate from BlueCo - the new parent company that will oversee  their multi club structure - and a potential loan deal involving Strasbourg. The Blues have history of signing emerging Egyptian talent having signed Salah from Basel in 2014. 90min understands there's also interest in Adel from France, Spain and Germany, but the Premier League is thought to be the player's preference at this point."
Barcelona at odds with Ferran Torres over summer transfer,"Jul 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-ferran-torres-summer-transfer,"Barcelona would like to sell Ferran Torres this summer, 90min understands, but the Spaniard remains adamant that he does not want to leave Camp Nou. The 23-year-old left Manchester City for a fee just shy of Â£50m in January 2022, but he's struggled to make an impact at Barca in his 18 months at the club. He has scored just 14 goals in 71 appearances all competitions and noticeably fell down Xavi's pecking order last season - evidenced by just 14 La Liga starts during 2022/23. Despite his struggles, Torres has garnered significant interest from the Premier League. 90min revealed in May that Mikel Arteta was keen to take Torres or Barcelona team-mate Raphinha to Arsenal, while Newcastle have also kept a close eye on his situation as they target signing a new wide forward. Unai Emery's Aston Villa have also shown interest in Torres after qualifying for next season's Conference League, but the Spaniard has resisted Villa's interest to date, revealing to local media at the end of June: ""Today, I am at Barca, but football takes many turns. I have the phone on airplane mode, on July 10 [the start of pre-season], I will open it. ""I'm just focused on what's mine, training, taking advantage of the pre-season that I couldn't do last year [due to injury] and from here on, showing that I'm a great footballer. In the next few days you will have news."" feed 90min understands that Torres' stance over a move hasn't changed, despite the club making it clear that he will be behind Raphinha, Ousmane Dembele and Ansu Fati in Xavi's wide forward pecking order, and there's currently no persuading him that moving on is in his best interests. Indeed, the former Valencia academy graduate believes he can earn a place in the side. Barcelona remain in dire financial trouble - which prevented Lionel Messi's fairytale return to the club materialising - and need to raise money this summer through player sales, or simply by clearing players off the wage bill. A loan move for Torres would be sanctioned - something 90min understands would certainly appeal to Aston Villa - but any reasonable offer for the 35-cap Spain international would also be taken. Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba and Samuel Umtiti have already departed Barca on free transfers, though their exits have been partly offset by the arrivals of Ilkay Gundogan and Inigo Martinez, as well as the return of several fringe players from loan spells away."
Tottenham announce Manor Solomon transfer,"Jul 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-announce-manor-solomon-transfer,"Tottenham have announced the signing of Israel international Manor Solomon from Shakhtar Donetsk, following on from his loan at Fulham last season. Final completion of the deal remains subject to international clearance and securing a new work permit, but the 23-year-old forward has agreed a long-term contract until 2028. Solomon had been making an impact in the Israeli Premier League from the age of 17, before heading to Ukraine with Shakhtar in 2019. He was then able to join Fulham on loan due to a ruling by FIFA that allowed foreign players suspend their contracts owing to the ongoing Russian invasion. The same ruling has also now allowed Solomon to join Spurs on a free transfer, although Shakhtar have been left angered, claiming it has cost them substantial income. Solomon missed several months of last season as a result of a knee injury, but recovered to become a regular part of a strong Fulham team that impressed by finishing in the top half of the final Premier League table â he even scored in four successive games across February and March."

Kane's future has been the subject of much speculation this summer, with 90min reporting that Bayern Munich lodged a second bid worth â¬80m for his services this week.  Despite the interest from Bayern, Tottenham have no intention of selling their all-time top goalscorer this summer and have not set a price tag for his services.  The striker is entering the final year of his contract at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the Lilywhites widely expected to offer fresh terms over a new deal in the coming weeks.  feed Speaking to the press ahead of his first pre-season at Spurs manager, Postecoglou revealed that he does not intend to give Kane special treatment in order to keep him at the club. ""I don't think it's my role to sit there and treat people in a manner because of their circumstances,"" the new boss said. ""I treat everyone the same. Harry is already an important figure in the history of this football club. He's one of the premier players in the world. I want him here and I want to make this club successful.

Deco addresses Barcelona's failed Arda Guler transfer,"Jul 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/deco-addresses-barcelona-s-failed-arda-guler-transfer,"New Barcelona sporting director Deco had very little to say when pushed by journalists to explain why the club was unable to sign Arda Guler. The 18-year-old Turkish star recently joined Real Madrid from Fenerbahce in a â¬20m transfer and was unveiled at the Bernabeu last week. Guler broke into Fenerbahceâs first-team aged 16 and became increasingly prominent during an impressive 2022/23 season that saw Spainâs biggest clubs go head to head to sign him. 90min reported before an announcement was made that Guler had chosen Real over Barcelona. Both clubs were willing to go to â¬20m, which was more than his â¬17.5m release clause, but the role played by Los Blancos chief scout Juni Calafat was significant. feed Deco, who is yet to be officially presented in his new Barcelona role, was out for lunch with director of football Mateu Alemany on Monday. Upon leaving the restaurant, he was asked by reporters why Guler hadnât joined Barcelona last week. His short answer: ""I don't know."" It has been reported by SPORT that Deco felt used to extract more money from Real Madrid during the Guler negotiations, having travelled to Turkey for talks believing that a deal was on the way to being completed and left concerned that the transfer would be at risk. Despite the â¬20m transfer fee, journalist Toni Juanmarti has suggested that Realâs outlay could reach â¬50m once add-ons, commission, bonuses and salary are taken into account. Indeed, it is claimed that Guler and his family have made more money direct from the transfer than Fenerbahce, with an â¬8m signing bonus going to the player and a â¬15m commission going to his father."
Chelsea striker joins Bundesliga club to play Champions League football,"Jul 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-striker-joins-bundesliga-club-to-play-champions-league-football,"Chelsea striker David Datro Fofana has joined Union Berlin on loan for the duration of the 2023/24 season, a move that promises to offer the Ivory Coast international more game time. It will additionally see Fofana get the opportunity to play in the Champions League as a result of Union taking the Bundesliga by storm again last season and improving on their fifth place finish from 2021/22 to place fourth behind RB Leipzig, Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich. Were Fofana to have stayed at Stamford Bridge this coming season, he wouldn't have been playing European football of any kind after the Blues recorded their lowest Premier League finish since 1994. Having impressed for Molde in Norway, Fofana was one of six additions to the Chelsea squad during an extraordinarily busy January transfer window. Only 20, he made just three Premier League appearances despite the team's struggles, but now faces further competition for places from new forward arrivals Christopher Nkunku and Nicolas Jackson. feed ""Union have developed extremely strongly in the last few years and it excites me a lot to be a part of this in the coming season.

"Victor Osimhen: Man Utd, Real Madrid & Chelsea learn what it will take to sign Napoli striker","Jul 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/victor-osimhen-man-utd-real-madrid-chelsea-sign-napoli-striker,"Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis says the club is prepared to sell star striker Victor Osimhen this summer, but only if a ""more than indecent proposal arrives"". Osimhen cost Napoli a club record â¬70m, potentially rising to â¬80m, 2020 and took a previously respectable goal return to new heights this past season when he scored 26 league goals to help deliver a first Serie A title since 1990 and the days of Diego Maradona. Naturally, the Nigeria international is on the transfer radar of other clubs. Chelsea have been firmly targeting Osimhen since February, having already stepped up their scouting presence with regard to the player last autumn. Manchester United are also in the market for a striker, while Real Madrid are additionally linked following the surprise departure of Karim Benzema earlier this summer. But Napoli and De Laurentiis are known for being tough negotiators, bleeding â¬90m out of Juventus for Gonzalo Higuain in 2016, selling Edinson Cavani for â¬64m, Jorginho for nearly â¬60m and successfully rebuffing interest in Kalidou Koulibaly until he was past his peak. The situation is no different with Osimhen and fellow star name Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. feed De Laurentiis remains confident that Osimhen will stay at Napoli into next season, although he hasnât ruled at a sale completely in his latest comments on the saga. âWe will see Victor Osimhen wearing our shirt next season, thatâs for sure,â he stated to Sky Italy, before adding, âThen if a more than indecent proposal arrives, we will move on and find another top talent as we did with Kvaratskhelia and Osimhen.â Such a proposal that is too difficult to turn down would likely have to mean Osimhen becomes one of the most expensive players in history. Napoli value the 24-year-old at â¬150m â only a handful of players including Kylian Mbappe and Neymar have ever transferred for more money. 90min understands that, as things stand, no club is prepared to meet that asking price. As for Osimhen himself, he recently indicated his willingness to stay at Napoli by saying: ""I am so happy I made the right choice by coming here. And achieving this kind of greatness with the Neapolitans is something that I will wake up and always smile about."""

Tottenham continuing Edmond Tapsoba and Micky van de Ven talks,"Jul 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-edmond-tapsoba-micky-van-de-ven-talks,"Tottenham are continuing to work on deals for Bayer Leverkusen's Edmond Tapsoba and Wolfsburg's Micky van de Ven, 90min understands. The two central defenders have been targeted as Spurs look to put a disappointing 2022/23 campaign firmly in the rear-view mirror - one that saw the club concede 63 goals en route to an eighth place finish in the Premier League, missing out on qualifying for Europe in the process. Spurs, who appointed Ange Postecoglou as their new head coach at the beginning of June, have considered moves for Aymeric Laporte and Max Kilman among others, but have been actively pursuing for Tapsoba and Van de Ven over the past few weeks. 90min previously revealed that Spurs were concerned over rival interest in 24-year-old Tapsoba - Liverpool, Manchester United and Newcastle United among those being kept apprised of his situation - but were progressing talks are learning of his interest in moving to north London. Those talks are still ongoing, with discussions with the player's representatives at an advanced stage, but there's work to do in terms of agreeing a deal with Leverkusen. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Xabi Alonso's side are looking to pocket around â¬50m (Â£42.5m) for Tapsoba - a fee Spurs may ultimately not need to pay if they're able to progress a deal for Van de Ven. feed Wolfsburg value the Dutchman at around â¬40m (Â£34m), though he doesn't yet offer the same level as experience as Tapsoba. Van de Ven does, however, offer Spurs the versatility of being able to play at left-back as well as at centre-back, and he recently represented Netherlands at the Under-21 European Championship. Talks are also at advanced stage with Van de Ven's camp - 90min previously revealed Spurs' confidence of concluding a deal - and discussions are ongoing with Wolfsburg about the proposed fee. It's unclear at this stage whether or not Spurs are prepared to conclude deals for both players, or whether the club are simply putting themselves in a position of strength as pre-season gets underway. Guglielmo Vicario and James Maddison have already arrived at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this summer, while Dejan Kulusevski's loan from Juventus has been turned into a permanent deal."
Sergej Milinkovic-Savic offered huge Saudi Pro League contract,"Jul 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/sergej-milinkovic-savic-offered-huge-saudi-pro-league-contract,"Sergej Milinkovic-Savic has been offered a lucrative long-term contract to join the list of high-profile players in the Saudi Pro League, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 28-year-old has been often linked with a move away from Lazio, having spent eight years in the Italian capital establishing himself as one of the finest central midfielders in Serie A. Juventus have been long-term admirers of Milinkovic-Savic, without ever formalising their interest, while Inter also considered him as a potential transfer target before opting for the more reasonably priced Davide Frattesi. Milinkovic-Savic has also been linked with a move to the Premier League on a number of occasions, though 90min understands that links to Arsenal and Newcastle this summer are wide of the mark. Instead, sources have confirmed that Milinkovic-Savic has received an offer from one of the four PIF-backed Saudi Pro League clubs, Al Hilal, which could be worth around Â£20m-a-year - close to 10x times the salary he's currently receiving from Lazio. Talks have been held with the player's representatives over moving to the Middle East, though they are also contacting clubs from around Europe to see if Milinkovic-Savic has any alternative options to consider. manual Lazio for their part have been offered â¬40m to allow Milinkovic-Savic to leave, which sources have told 90min they have verbally agreed to do pending the Serbian's decision. ""I don't think it's a problem of stimuli, if one wants to go to Saudi Arabia the stimulus is only the money,"" Lazio's president, Claudio Lotito, said of Milinkovic-Savic potentially leaving. ""But you have to ask him. I searched until the end to keep him, but if he asks me to leave for his own personal matter, what can I do?  ""We were willing to renew the contract by increasing his salary. I have a good relationship with him, but in the end the player decides what he wants to do in life. Savic phoned me begging me to let him go."" Referencing Al Hilal's bid in particular, he added: ""This offer has not actually arrived and, as long as he is a Lazio player, he will retire. I made a commitment with the boy that if a normal offer were to arrive minimum for Lazio he could go away. The offer is 50 million lower, a little less."" Milinkovic-Savic has been one of the best players in Serie A since joining Lazio from Genk in 2015, scoring 69 goals in 341 appearances en route to winning the Coppa Italia and the Serie A Best Midfielder award in 2019."
Saudi Pro League pushing to make Paul Pogba marquee signing,"Jul 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/saudi-pro-league-paul-pogba-marquee-signing,"The Saudi Pro League are continuing to push for Paul Pogba to be their marquee summer arrival, though the Juventus midfielder is unconvinced by a move at this stage, 90min understands. The riches of the Middle East have tempted a number of high-profile players into making the switch this summer, including Karim Benzema, N'Golo Kante, Roberto Firmino and Ruben Neves to name just four. More star names are expected to follow in the coming weeks and months, with Saudi Arabia looking to not only improve the quality of their league but also establish a real foothold in the world of football ahead of a bid to host the 2030 FIFA World Cup. Saudi's Public Investment Fund (PIF), who have a controlling interest in Newcastle United, have already poured huge amounts of money into four of the biggest clubs in the country - Al Ittihad, Al Nassr, Al Hilal and Al Ahli - and their intention is to continue attracting the best players in the world. 90min exclusively revealed in early June that Pogba was one of the biggest names on PIF's radar and that remains the case, despite him being limited to just 151 minutes of football for Juventus last season because of a myriad of injury problems.  manual The 30-year-old even visited Saudi Arabia over the weekend, with sources confirming to 90min that talks were held with PIF over a potential move - though he primarily visited because of external business interests and personal reasons. Pogba, as it stands, would prefer to remain at Juventus to prove himself to manager Massimiliano Allegri - the Italian brought him back to Turin for a second spell and has been loyal to Pogba throughout his career - but the club would not stand in his way if he indicated a desire to leave. 90min understands that a switch to the Saudi Pro League is likely in Pogba's future at some point - PIF view him as the best Muslim player in the world and a cornerstone signing - and that if and when he makes the move, his wages would be on a par with the Â£172m Benzema earns per annum at Al Ittihad. That would make Pogba the highest-paid player in the league once image right and add-ons are factored in, while the club he would join would almost certainly be Al Ittihad - making him a team-mate of Benzema and Kante, who also joined the champions from Chelsea earlier this window."
Donny van de Beek's potential destinations ahead of expected Man Utd exit,"Jul 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/donny-van-de-beek-potential-destinations-man-utd-exit,"Donny van de Beek has sunk into the abyss at Manchester United and the arrival of Mason Mount has further obscured his pathway to first team minutes. The former Ajax star was set to earn a new lease of life at Old Trafford following the arrival of Erik ten Hag, his former boss in Amsterdam, last summer. However, injuries and Bruno Fernandes' significance meant Van de Beek embarked on yet another underwhelming campaign for the Red Devils. The Dutchman was limited to 163 minutes in seven Premier League appearances as Ten Hag struggled to find a role for the astute midfielder. With his career at a crossroads, Van de Beek is expected to leave United this summer with the Red Devils keen to oversee a permanent sale. Here are five feasible options for the midfielder as a whole host of clubs take an interest in acquiring the 26-year-old. Sevilla's 2022/23 season ended with their annual Europa League success and they'll want to carry on that momentum into their 2023/24 domestic campaign.The arrival of Jose Luis Mendilibar as manager sparked a pretty drastic upsurge following the instability facilitated by Jorge Sampaoli.Mendilibar settled upon a 4-2-3-1 following his appointment, with Oliver Torres and Papu Gomez operating as the new manager's magic man between the lines. Van de Beek's best football at Ajax came in a #10 role under Ten Hag and Sevilla could purchase the Dutchman as a potential replacement for 35-year-old Gomez. A return to familiar surroundings may be in store for Van de Beek. The crafty midfielder rose to prominence in the Dutch capital operating as Ten Hag's canny space interpreter who always found himself in the right place at the right time. He played a somewhat unsung role amid Ajax's stellar 2018/19 season with others being thrust into the limelight, but he still earned a big move to United off the back of his Ajax majesty.The 26-year-old has failed to acclimatise to life in the Premier League and will undoubtedly be tempted by his former home this summer. Ajax aren't the exceptional outfit of the Ten Hag era, but Van de Beek will feel at ease at the Johan Cruyff Arena. feed He couldn't, could he?There isn't a fiercer rivalry in Dutch football than De Klassieker contested between the country's two most successful sides: Ajax and Feyenoord. Nevertheless, a whole host of players, including Johan Cruyff and Ronald Koeman, have crossed the divide over the years.Could Van de Beek be next?From a stylistic and tactical perspective, a move to Feyenoord would perhaps make more sense than a return to Ajax this summer. The exit of Orkun Kokcu to Benfica means Arne Slot needs a midfielder of Van de Beek's mould. While his best work has often come in a more advanced role, Slot could perhaps evolve VDB into a tireless double-pivot performer as he did with Kokcu. Nice put together one of the most bizarre squads Europe had to offer last season and that's why they should be considered a serious contender for Van de Beek's signature.The French club's transfer policy of signing Premier League outcasts saw Ross Barkley and Nicolas Pepe join the likes of Dante and Aaron Ramsey in the south of France, although this bunch were outshone by the club's impressive youth cohort.There appear to be superior stylistic fits for VDB this summer, but Nice must be considered as a legitimate option. A move may depend on Khephren Thuram's future. Crystal Palace are one of three Premier League clubs keen on signing Van de Beek this summer and certainly a much better fit than either Wolves or Nottingham Forest.Pragmatist Julen Lopetegui hasn't exactly been an appreciator of Van de Beek profiles in the past, while Forest are well-stocked in terms of creative midfielders.Palace, though, could be a fun environment for VDB in the Premier League. Roy Hodgson helped restore the good vibes at Selhurst Park by given his forward-thinking players plenty of freedom. Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze shone down the stretch as a result and Van de Beek would surely benefit from such relaxed but smart coaching."
Chelsea hold talks with Montpellier over exciting young French striker,"Jul 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-talks-montpellier-young-french-striker,"Chelsea have met with Montpellier to discuss a possible summer move for 20-year-old striker Elye Wahi, 90min understands. Wahi enjoyed a breakout season in Ligue 1 last year, racking up 19 goals - good enough for seventh in the division's scoring charts - while also chipping in with a further six assists. That form has, unsurprisingly, caught the eyes of a number of teams across Europe and 90min understands representatives of Chelsea's BlueCo ownership group have spoken to Montpellier over a potential deal for Wahi. At this point, it is unclear whether Wahi is seen as a target for Chelsea or the newest club in the BlueCo family, fellow Ligue 1 side Strasbourg, who have just appointed Patrick Vieira as their new manager. Vieira is understood to have been involved in conversations about Wahi since joining. In England, Wahi has also been tracked by Bournemouth, Crystal Palace and Wolves, while Lazio and Union Berlin are known admirers in mainland Europe. feed However, it is Eintracht Frankfurt who are seen as the biggest competitors for Wahi's signature, with the Bundesliga side seeing him as a potential replacement for Randal Kolo Muani if the in-demand forward moves elsewhere. A source close to Wahi has confirmed to 90min that the striker is intrigued by the idea of moving to Frankfurt, where fellow Frenchman Kolo Muani exploded into a â¬100m target for a handful of European giants. Over the weekend, Montpellier president Laurent Nicollin confessed to Midi Libre that 'a German and an English club' are battling for Wahi's signature, ultimately declining to reveal their identities. Chelsea have already bolstered their forward line with the signings of Christopher Nkunku and Nicolas Jackson but are understood to remain in the market for another striker. An enquiry has been made over Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic, in which Romelu Lukaku's name was mentioned, but Chelsea continue to evaluate all their options."
Five strikers Real Madrid could sign instead of Kylian Mbappe,"Jul 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/five-strikers-real-madrid-sign-instead-kylian-mbappe,"We've been here before, folks: Kylian Mbappe, Real Madrid. Run it back. The Frenchman's antics this summer have seemingly disillusioned the club where he boasts supreme power, and a move to the Spanish capital is more than a feasible possibility after years of missed opportunities on Real's behalf. However, there are no guarantees that such a mammoth and complex deal will go through heading into 2023/24.  With Karim Benzema venturing off to the emerging Saudi frontier, Real's striker situation is currently a precarious one. They won't be heading into the new season with Joselu leading the line, that's for sure, and Endrick, the Brazilian sensation who'll arrive next summer, is surely too young to be considered Benzema's successor right away.  There's a period of transition up top Real must mitigate, and they're hoping to acquire Mbappe as their next Galactico. However, there are other options for Los Blancos should Mbappe remain in Paris.  Here a five alternatives to Mbappe for the Spanish giants to consider. Age: 24Club: Napoli Fresh off his Capocannoniere crowning season with Napoli, Osimhen has attracted interest from several members of Europe's elite and is considered one of the most valuable forwards on the planet. As a result, Aurelio De Laurentiis will not let his Nigerian hitman depart lightly this summer and the president's stubbornness will likely deter potential suitors. As special as Osimhen is, clubs are unlikely to come close to Napoli's reported asking price of Â£150m.  The Italian club's depth up top could facilitate a sale late in the summer, but it's hard to envisage Real spending that sort of cash for a player not called Kylian.  The 24-year-old would thrive under the bright Bernabeu lights, but a considerable compromise will have to be reached over a fee if Real were to step up their interest. Age: 24Club: Eintracht Frankfurt Another name doing the rounds in transfer rumour mills this summer, Kolo Muani has had Manchester United and Bayern Munich on his tail. The French international is expected to leave Eintracht Frankfurt after their disappointing 2022/23 season, but the two aforementioned clubs have moved on to different targets. United are pushing for Atalanta's Rasmus Hojlund, while Bayern are hopeful of prising Harry Kane away from Tottenham. Good luck with that, guys.  Nevertheless, Kolo Muani remains on the market and he could be a wise alternative to Mbappe. He's a flexible frontman who loves to drift out to the channels and battle defenders one-on-one. The young forward may not be an out-and-out number nine, but neither is Mbappe. Alongside Rodrygo and Vinicius Jr, the trio could combine to create an interchangeable machine up top with speed to burn in behind defences. Age: 25Club: Inter Despite another productive season with Inter, Lautaro hasn't been such a prominent name in the market this summer. The World Cup winner is among the hottest and coldest strikers. He's so hard to defend against when he's on, but his off days are so woeful that many clubs will undoubtedly be deterred.  Consistency has been an issue for Lautaro throughout his senior career, but the striker's maturation has seen him evolve into a regular producer in front of goal. He scored 20+ Serie A goals for the second season running in 2022/23 and played a leading role as the Nerazzurri lifted two domestic trophies before reaching the Champions League final. The Lautaro of three years ago may not have been able to cope with the pressure of leading Real's line, but the new and improved iteration certainly is.  Age: 23Club: Man City A left-field choice, but Real may have to think outside of the box if they're to find a desirable Mbappe alternative this summer. Success for Alvarez at Manchester City seemed inevitable after the Citizens snapped the River Plate hotshot up for peanuts and he joined the club ahead of the 2022/23 season. Despite playing second fiddle to Erling Haaland, Alvarez scored 17 times in all competitions and played a starring role in Argentina's ascent to World Cup glory. Alvarez has already drawn comparisons to Sergio Aguero, but some might argue the young Argentine has more strings to his bow. While an excellent finisher, Alvarez has the makings of an elite multi-faceted #9 in the mould of Kane.  City will surely demand a monster fee, but it's worth Real testing the waters. Age: 23Club: Lille There are several avenues Los Blancos could go this summer if they miss out on Mbappe again.  They could go for a stop-gap to oversee the period of transition before the Frenchman's inevitable arrival in 2024 as well as Endrick's, a seasoned star who'll ensure Real are competitive in 2023/24 and beyond, or they could continue their new policy of breeding exciting young talent and back them to shine right away.  Two of our suggested five fall into the second category, while the other three fall into the third, including our fifth alternative: Jonathan David.  The 23-year-old has enjoyed three stellar seasons with Lille and he just enjoyed the most productive campaign of his career to date, scoring 24 goals in 37 Ligue 1 appearances. David has caught the eye of plenty amid his rise in France, and Juventus are said to be in the race for him this summer."
Levi Colwill reveals non-negotiable stance amid Liverpool transfer links,"Jul 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/levi-colwill-non-negotiable-stance-liverpool-transfer,"Chelsea defender Levi Colwill is adamant he must be playing regular club football as he targets a place in England's senior squad. Colwill was a key member of England's U21's side that beat Spain in the UEFA U21 European Championship final on Sunday, playing the full 90 minutes as Lee Carsley's side edged over the line thanks to goalkeeper James Trafford's sensational penalty save in stoppage-time. The 20-year-old was also one of the breakout stars of the 2022/23 Premier League season, becoming a regular under Roberto De Zerbi during a successful loan spell at Brighton and Hove Albion.  90min recently revealed that despite Brighton's willingness to spend a club record Â£40m to sign Colwill on a permanent deal, Chelsea are unwilling to sanction a move and want to see how he performs under Mauricio Pochettino in pre-season before making a final decision. Liverpool have also been linked to Colwill, amid uncertainty around Joel Matip's long-term future at Anfield, but sources have confirmed to 90min that the Reds are acutely aware that a transfer is almost certainly off the table. feed With Colwill's stock high, there have been suggestions that Gareth Southgate will look to make him a regular fixture in England's senior squad this season. And that's something the defender has admitted is a target of his, though he was quick to conclude that he must be playing regular games in order to make it happen. ""Weâre all pushing and knocking on the door,â Colwill said, in quoted relayed by the Mail. ""Everyone has to pay attention to every player here. I feel like this team we had was more than just individuals. In the past England might have lacked with that. Weâve always had great players but I think this team is so much different. I love this team. ""Iâll speak to my family, speak to everyone I need to and make a decision. Iâve got to play at the end of the day, to hopefully get there and go to the next [senior] camp. ""But if Iâm here, Iâll still be happy. Youâve always got to be happy when youâre picked for any England age group. Itâs an honour."" Colwill recently received his first England senior call-up ahead of the Euro 2024 qualifiers against Malta and North Macedonia, but failed to make an appearance in either game."
Chelsea hold firm on Romelu Lukaku valuation after rejecting Inter bid,"Jul 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-hold-firm-on-romelu-lukaku-valuation-inter-bid,"Chelsea have warned Inter they must come closer to their asking price of Â£40m for striker Romelu Lukaku, 90min understands. The two clubs have been locked in negotiations over Lukaku for months, with Chelsea knocking back a handful of offers from Inter as they seek to recover as much money as possible from their initial Â£97.5m investment. Inter's attempts to re-sign Lukaku on loan were quickly blocked by Chelsea, who are only entertaining a permanent departure for the wantaway Belgian. An offer of around Â£30m has recently been rejected by Chelsea, with sources confirming to 90min that the Blues are pushing Inter to raise their bid by another Â£10m. Inter are not blessed with a huge transfer budget and are therefore keen to avoid spending big on Lukaku, although the sale of goalkeeper Andre Onana to Manchester United could offer the Nerazzurri added flexibility in negotiations if it goes through as expected. feed Talks between the two clubs are ongoing and are complicated by the fact that Chelsea still owe money to Inter for their initial purchase of Lukaku in the summer of 2021. While that is not expected to get in the way of an agreement, it does add another layer in discussions. To try and aid the move, Lukaku is prepared to take a significant pay cut. He is focused solely on returning to Inter this summer despite attracting interest from elsewhere. Juventus have enquired about Lukaku after Chelsea voiced an interest in Bianconeri striker Dusan Vlahovic - one of many names on a shortlist of potential Blues targets - but Lukaku is not interested in joining another Serie A side. Lukaku has also snubbed the chance to move to Saudi Arabia, who made a renewed effort to convince the striker to head to the Middle East after initially reaching out earlier this summer. Their offer remains on the table but, as it stands, Lukaku does not want to accept as he waits for Inter to reach an agreement."
Clubs alerted to Daichi Kamada availability as AC Milan stop free transfer,"Jul 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/clubs-alerted-to-daichi-kamada-availability-transfer,"Daichi Kamada is suddenly on the market again after AC Milan pulled the plug on his proposed free transfer to San Siro, 90min understands. Various clubs in the Premier League, Serie A and Bundesliga have all been informed of the situation and his availability. Japan international Kamada has been a free agent since the end of June when his contract with Eintracht Frankfurt expired. The 26-year-old had made a name for himself with the German club since 2017, winning the Europa League in 2021/22 and then reaching the knockout rounds of the Champions League in 2022/23. As a goalscoring midfielder, he found the net 16 times in all competitions last season. Seeking a new challenge, an agreement to join Milan was reached in early June. However, just a few days later the club sacked technical director Paolo Maldini, while Frederic Massara also left his role as sporting director. Chief executive Giorgio Furlani and chief scout Geoffrey Moncada have been overseeing transfers since, with Antonio DâOttavio, former head of youth scouting, said to also be internally promoted to fill the sporting director vacancy. feed That has changed the situation regarding Kamada and the new hierarchy have different ideas. 90min understands the deal was agreed and signed from the playerâs side of things, with Milan pulling out. As a free agent without a club, he now has to look elsewhere. Inter and Napoli, both of whom finished higher than Milan in the final Serie A table last season, have been offered Kamada. Borussia Dortmund, who had shown an interest in the player before, have also been informed of the situation. It is a similar story for Tottenham and Newcastle, each holding an interest previously."
Donny van de Beek exploring options to leave Manchester United,"Jul 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/donny-van-de-beek-exploring-options-manchester-united,"Donny van de Beek's representatives have been in discussions with a number of European clubs regarding the Dutchman's potential summer departure from Manchester United, 90min understands. Van de Beek joined United in September 2020 from Ajax, but has never been able to establish a foothold in the club's first team under a number of managers. Van de Beek has been behind Bruno Fernandes in the midfield pecking order and has struggled with a number of debilitating injuries during his spell in England. Under Erik ten Hag, current United manager and Van de Beek's former manager at Ajax, the player's fortunes haven't changed. Van de Beek sustained an injury in January which kept him out for the second half of last season and while he has joined pre-season training in recent days, United have also signed Mason Mount from Chelsea - further reducing Van de Beek's chances of playing time in the new campaign. While Ten Hag has a good relationship with the player, it's understood by 90min that he and the decision-makers at United have green-lit Van de Beek's departure from the club, and the player's camp are exploring a new challenge. feed Van de Beek has a number of clubs in Serie A interested in his services, with Inter, Roma and Milan all making their own enquiries, though it's understood he is not a first choice target for any of the three. In the Premier League, Wolves, Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace are all monitoring the 26-year-old's situation. Europa League holders Sevilla and Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Nice hold interest, as does Brendan Rodgers' Celtic. A return to Ajax has not been ruled out either and Dutch champions Feyenoord would also be open to accomodating the player on the right terms. United would prefer a sale as they try to clear their squad of players who aren't in the long-term plans for the first team, though a loan looks more likely as it stands. Anthony Martial, club captain Harry Maguire, Fred, Dean Henderson, Eric Bailly and Alex Telles are all among a host of players United would like to part ways with before the new season starts; to clear their wage bill and raise funds to reinvest into the first team. United are trying to secure up to two new forwards and another midfielder, while right back and centre back are on the agenda to strengthen. United are likely to follow up the signing of Mount this week with a deal worth over â¬50m expected to be confirmed for Inter's Andre Onana, following David de Gea's departure on a free transfer over the weekend."
Jurrien Timber's brother drops huge hint on Arsenal transfer,"Jul 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jurrien-timber-brother-huge-hint-arsenal-transfer,"The brother of Ajax defender Jurrien Timber appears to have posted an image of the Dutchman's farewell party as his move to Arsenal edges closer. Arsenal have agreed to pay an initial â¬42m, plus a further â¬5m in add-ons, to seal the signature of the 22-year-old, who has been training away from the Ajax first team while the finishing touches on his Emirates switch are thrashed out.  It appears as though Arsenal fans' wait for Timber's arrival could soon be coming to an end as the defender's older brother, Shamier, has now posted what appears to be a sign from a farewell party that also features Jurrien wearing an Arsenal shirt. ð¨ JurriÃ«n Timberâs brother on Instagram! pic.twitter.com/D9uptL7GLd The post, which has since been deleted, reads: ""Jurrien's Goodbye party. See you in the streets of London."" Timber has already undergone a medical with Arsenal and is set to become their second signing of the summer any day now, following Kai Havertz's Â£65m switch from Chelsea. He should soon be followed through the door by West Ham midfielder Declan Rice after Arsenal agreed to a payment structure for their proposed Â£105m acquisition of the England international. feed With Arsenal now bolstering in all their priority positions, the focus could soon turn to outgoings as the Gunners have a number of fringe stars who could be sold. The likes of Kieran Tierney and Nuno Tavares have attracted interest, while midfielder Thomas Partey was granted permission to discuss a move to Saudi Arabia which is not currently believed to be in the Ghanaian's plans. In attack, there is plenty of interest in striker Folarin Balogun after his return from his loan with Stade Reims. A handful of Premier League sides are keen on the 22-year-old, who is also wanted in mainland Europe."

The 10 most expensive Brazil players of all time,"Jul 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/10-most-expensive-brazil-players-all-time,"Transfers may be getting more lucrative as the years go by, but Brazilians footballers have always been among the most expensive players on the market. There is occasionally a premium price to pay for good Brazilian players, though every great team should have at least one Selecao player as they remind us all of why we love football. Some massive transfer fees have been paid for Brazilian players over the years, more commonly when they move from their first European club to an even bigger one, having originally moved from Brazil for a smaller fee. Here are the ten most expensive Brazilian footballers of all time. Richarlison enjoyed the drama that Everton provided year on year but left in 2022 when Tottenham came calling with a Â£60m offer.Spurs ended the Brazilian's debut season in north London in catastrophic fashion with Richarlison's contribution minimal. This was a move viewed by many as somewhat disappointing. Oscar was an impressive and important player for Chelsea and the national team but opted for the riches that Chinese clubs could offer.He moved to Shanghai Port, known as Shanghai SIPG at the time in 2017, for a massive fee. He remains in China, suggesting he must have settled very well. A recent entrant here, Manchester United's deal for Casemiro in 2022 saw him leave Real Madrid after nine frighteningly successful years.He was an immediate hit in the Premier League as he showed why he is one of the best midfielders in the world, although suspensions were an issue later in the season. It was a big fee for a player who was 30 at the time, but he seems to still be at the peak of his powers. Before Sandro Tonali had his move to Newcastle confirmed, this was the biggest fee ever paid for an AC Milan player. Kaka was a star in Serie A but the time came for him to try an even bigger challenge in 2009.He spent four years in Spain before he going back to Milan for a year until he left again in 2014. Certainly the highest player on this list to make minimal impact anywhere since the move, Arthur Melo was involved in an odd transfer to Juventus in 2020. Juventus paid â¬72m for him but the deal was also part of a coordinated swap that saw Miralem Pjanic go the other way. Arthur was not useless at Juventus, but his impact was not what they had hoped it would be. Most recently he was on loan at Liverpool where he made one appearance all season, with injuries beginning to mark his career. An incredibly expensive deal for a goalkeeper which has gone on to look like value for money. Alisson Becker was a superb goalkeeper for AS Roma in Serie A and then he got the move he deserved.It is not easy to turn up at a club like Liverpool as a goalkeeper with that kind of fee on your head, but he has cemented himself as one of, if not the best goalkeeper in the world. Neymar has been the subject of two huge transfer fees and appears twice in the top ten. The first was the massive â¬86m move from Santos to Barcelona in 2014.The eccentric attacker was part of a treble-winning side and formed a deadly partnership with Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi before he made a dramatic exit from Camp Nou. The most recent huge fee to be paid for a Brazilian, Antony joined Manchester United in 2022 like Casemiro but much later in the summer. The â¬100m fee meant there was immense pressure on the new arrival from Ajax.While ridiculed by many, the development of Antony's game through the 2022/23 season was clear and he ended the season with eight goals and three assists. This is a move that did not work out but Philippe Coutinho will still be able to take immense pride in his career regardless. The move from Liverpool to Barcelona in 2018 was a monster and the pressure appeared too much.He did not fit in the system at Barcelona and could not show his best form. He had a loan at Bayern Munich before another at Aston Villa, which has become his new home."
PSG confirm signing of Lucas Hernandez from Bayern Munich,"Jul 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-confirm-signing-lucas-hernandez-bayern-munich,"Paris Saint-Germain have completed the signing of French defender Lucas Hernandez from Bayern Munich. Personal terms were agreed with Lucas back in May around the same time as an agreement was struck to bring Manuel Ugarte to the French capital, but agreeing a deal with Bayern proved slightly more complicated. A fee of around â¬50m was eventually hammered out between the two clubs and Lucas has now sealed his move to PSG, signing a five-year contract until 2028. feed Born in Marseille, Lucas has never played club football in France. He moved to Spain aged four and, after coming through the Atletico Madrid academy, joined Bayern for a fee of â¬80m in 2019. Injuries would prove to be a problem for Lucas in Germany, however. He managed just 107 appearances for the club across his four seasons with Bayern and only played 11 games last year as a result of a various serious fitness issues. Lucas will now have the chance to rebuild his fitness in Paris, while Bayern are set to replace the France international with Kim Min-jae of Napoli. The South Korean's release clause has been triggered and paid, with completion of the â¬50m deal expected imminently."
Rio Ferdinand gives verdict on Man Utd goalkeeper target Andre Onana,"Jul 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/rio-ferdinand-gives-verdict-man-utd-goalkeeper-target-andre-onana,"Rio Ferdinand expects goalkeeper Andre Onana to give Manchester United 'more confidence' but has warned there will likely still be 'mistakes' as the team adjusts to a new style of playing out from the back. David de Gea's departure after 12 years was confirmed on Saturday after the Spaniard's contract had expired at the end of last month and no new one was fully signed. The terms on a Â£200,000 per week deal had been agreed and signed on the playerâs side, only for the club to later withdraw it. Although arguably the best goalkeeper in the world between 2014 and 2017, De Gea had become increasingly error prone. There were also concerns about the 32-year-oldâs distribution and his unease in an increasingly modern and progressive playing style under Erik ten Hag. United are on course to make Ten Hag's former Ajax stopper Andre Onana their new number one. Two bids, the latter reaching â¬50m (Â£43m), have been turned down by Inter but there is expected to be a compromise below Interâs â¬60m (Â£51m) demands and 90min understands United are hoping to have a deal finalised in time for Onana to travel to Norway with the squad for the opening game of pre-season against Leeds on 12 July. The next friendly is in Edinburgh a week later. feed Ferdinand, who spent 12 years with United and won six Premier League titles, is supportive of the push for Onana and the skillset the Cameroonian will bring. ""He'll give United more confidence and more ability to play out from the back and I think he suits an Erik ten Hag team,"" the retired defender said on his FIVE YouTube channel. ""He's a real modern-day goalkeeper. You see teams pressing him and he doesn't even panic. He gets the ball in, brings on the press, says 'come on, come to me' and when that player comes to him, he knows there's a [teammate] free somewhere else and he normally finds them. ""I think there will be mistakes and playing that risky way you do have mistakes...that happens, but it's about staying true to your beliefs, finding the right balance and remaining calm throughout those periods."""
Bayern Munich pay full Kim Min-jae release clause to beat Man Utd to transfer,"Jul 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-pay-full-kim-min-jae-release-clause-man-utd-transfer,"Bayern Munich have paid the full release clause for Napoli centre-back Kim Min-jae and expect to complete the signing by Monday, 90min understands. Manchester United held talks with Kim over a possible transfer last month, but Bayern have beaten them to the highly-rated South Korea international. Kim quickly emerged as one of Europeâs best central defenders during his sole season with Napoli following an â¬18m transfer from Fenerbahce last summer. Having joined the Turkish giants from Beijing Guoan in China for just â¬3m in 2021, his rise to prominence has been rapid. feed A â¬50m release clause in Kimâs Napoli contract active from 1 July has been much talked about. Having been unsuccessful in offering the 26-year-old a fresh deal that would have meant a substantial pay rise while removing the clause, 90min understands the reigning Serie A champions were then never willing to negotiate a transfer fee with potential suitors and that paying the full amount specified in the contract was the only way to sign him. At one stage it is believed the preference of the playerâs camp was to join United, who are looking to move on Harry Maguire. Newcastle and Paris Saint-Germain were also in touch. But Bayern surged ahead and sources close to Napoli have now confirmed the full release clause has been received. Kim is set to complete the final part of his medical with the German giants and will become the latest Korean to join Bayern after Jeong Woo-yeong and Lee Hyun-ju in recent years."

His exit comes with Arsenal close to bringing in Declan Rice for a British record transfer fee as Mikel Arteta reshapes his midfield ahead of the 2023/24 season. There had been claims Xhaka's wife's unhappiness in England played a part in the 30-year-old leaving, but he has rejected that idea. Xhaka told Keystone-SDA: ""There was speculation everywhere that my wife was no longer happy in England. That is not at all true. feed ""The fact is that as a person I am always interested in new challenges. After seven years, the time has come for something completely new.  ""The league is not new, but the club is. During the talks with Simon Rolfes [sporting director] and Xabi Alonso, I felt that the long-term project at Leverkusen was worthwhile and that it was 100% in line with me."" The Switzerland international brought a fluctuating stint with the Gunners that lasted seven years to an end by returning to the Bundesliga with Xabi Alonso's Leverkusen. He won the FA Cup twice and scored 23 goals in 297 appearances for the north London side. Xhaka won over Arsenal fans by becoming an important cog under Mikel Arteta, having previously been an outcast under Unai Emery after storming off the pitch and losing the club captaincy in 2019."

PSG confirm signing of Lee Kang-in from Mallorca,"Jul 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-confirm-signing-lee-kang-in-mallorca,"Paris Saint-Germain have confirmed the signing of 22-year-old midfielder Lee Kang-in from Mallorca. PSG have been incredibly active this summer and have already announced the arrivals of Milan Skriniar, Marco Asensio and Manuel Ugarte, while Luis Enrique has replaced Christophe Galtier in the dugout. The next new face in Paris is Lee, who has inked a five-year contract in the French capital. ""It's a pleasure to be able to join Paris Saint-Germain, it's one of the biggest clubs in the world, with some of the greatest players in the world,"" said Lee, who will wear the number 19. ""I can't wait to start this new adventure."" PSG are understood to have parted with a fee of â¬22m to get this deal over the line. feed The French giants are not yet finished this summer and are expected to announce the arrival of defender Lucas Hernandez from Bayern Munich in the coming days.  After Lucas' arrival is confirmed, PSG's focus may well turn to departures and there is no issue more pressing than the future of Kylian Mbappe, who could be sold this summer after admitting he does not plan to extend his contract beyond next summer. Mbappe has publicly vowed to remain with PSG next season but club officials have made it clear that he will not be permitted to leave on a free transfer, leaving him two options - a contract extension or a sale. Long-time suitors Real Madrid are waiting for clarity on Mbappe's stance, safe in the knowledge they could sign him for free in 2024."
David de Gea's potential destinations after Man Utd exit,"Jul 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/david-de-gea-potential-destinations-after-man-utd-exit,"The last time David de Gea lined up for a club side that wasn't Manchester United, Sergio Aguero scored a hat-trick. The pair were at Atletico Madrid together in the distant days of 2011. However, unlike his former colleague - who was forced into premature retirement due to a heart condition - De Gea is set to carry on playing after announcing his departure from Manchester United at the start of July. ""Now, itâs the right time to undertake a new challenge,"" De Gea wrote in his farewell message, ""to push myself again in new surroundings."" Here's a look at where the hunt for new challenges and surroundings may take De Gea. Andre Onana has been United's chief target as De Gea's replacement throughout the summer. In the wake of the Spaniard's announcement, United are expected to lodge a third bid which comes closer to Inter's Â£51m valuation of Onana.Last season's defeated Champions League finalists could snag Onana's replacement as part of the negotiations. If Inter are willing to consider former Tottenham captain Hugo Lloris, why not take a look at De Gea? After finally ridding themselves of one ageing and increasingly erratic shot-stopper, Tottenham have been linked with signing another.De Gea is four years younger than Lloris and not quite as flawed but would still serve as an experienced option for the incoming Guglielmo Vicario to bounce off. Had it not been for football's unfathomable reliance upon the fax machine, De Gea could have been a Real Madrid player in 2015. The move never materialised but the Madrid-born keeper could return to his roots on a free transfer this summer.It's highly unlikely that Thibaut Courtois would entertain any competition for his berth as the club's undisputed number one, but De Gea would offer more solidity than the current backup option Andriy Lunin. The Italian icon Gianni Rivera once disparagingly referred to the American top flight as ""an elephant graveyard"". The division has done its best to rebrand itself as a hotbed of young talent but this summer has seen another influx of ageing stars flood the league.Inter Miami, with the headline-grabbing acquisitions of Lionel Messi and friends, are the chief culprits and may not have room for De Gea on their roster. However, MLS rivals Atlanta United may be tempted to procure the services of a Premier League champion without having to pay a transfer fee.Brad Guzan spent six years in England's top flight but has begun to show the effects of dulled reflexes of a shot-stopper that turns 39 in September. Guzan's backup Quentin Westberg is 37 himself, perhaps offering De Gea an avenue into MLS. Chelsea have been burned in the recent past after acquiring a Spanish goalkeeper. However, while Kepa Arrizabalaga commanded a world-record fee, De Gea would be available for free.At 32, De Gea should theoretically be at his peak as a goalkeeper. Chelsea were able to cajole a fee of Â£17m from Al Ahli for Edouard Mendy (who is 31) in June, opening up a slot in their goalkeeping reserves which De Gea has been linked with filling. When De Gea lined up against Newcastle at Wembley in February, not only did he steer the Red Devils to victory in the League Cup final but he kept a record-breaking 180th clean sheet in the process - no other player has ever racked up more in United's long history.Newcastle had to draft in the former Liverpool keeper Lorius Karius for the showpiece as injury and suspension conspired against the Magpies, hinting at a lack of depth behind the number one, Nick Pope.If De Gea did move to Tyneside - as is rumoured - his shaky distribution would not be a deal-breaker given the style of play Eddie Howe is fostering. David De Gea is LEAVING Manchester United after 12 years at the club! ð³ð§¤ pic.twitter.com/wFxV0x03ta For any player in search of a pay packet that European clubs are unwilling to cough up, the Saudi Pro League has emerged as an accommodating alternative.Al Hilal used four different goalkeepers last season, with 36-year-old Abdullah Al-Mayouf the most regular custodian. Ruben Neves and Kalidou Koulibaly have already joined the Saudi giants and De Gea could be next.De Gea has even been linked with a reunion with Cristiano Ronaldo at Al Nassr, who could step up their pursuit of the stopper now he is on the hunt for work."
When Man Utd hope to announce Andre Onana deal,"Jul 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/when-man-utd-hope-announce-andre-onana-deal,"Manchester United are hopeful of finalising the arrival of goalkeeper Andre Onana in time to take the Cameroon international to Oslo to kick-start their pre-season tour, 90min understands. United have seen a second bid, worth â¬50m, knocked back for Onana but are confident of reaching a full agreement in the near future. Inter had demanded â¬60m but the two sides are expected to meet in the middle somewhere. Talks between the two clubs have continued and progressed to a point that United are beginning to plan for Onana's imminent arrival. United are understood to be hopeful of reaching a full agreement to sign Onana over the weekend and sources have confirmed to 90min that the plan is to take the 27-year-old to Oslo when their pre-season tour begins on July 12. A friendly against Leeds United is on the cards, seven days before a meeting with Lyon in Edinburgh, Scotland. feed United are in need of a new starting goalkeeper this summer after David de Gea confirmed his departure from the club on Saturday. De Gea had been offered the chance to stay at United with a drastic reduction to his previous Â£375,000-a-week wages but the 32-year-old will now take his talents elsewhere, leaving United needing a new starter for the first time in 12 years. On the books currently are returning loanee Dean Henderson, who is of serious interest to Nottingham Forest, and 37-year-old Tom Heaton. Inter could look to reinvest any money earned from Onana's departure in Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku. The Blues will only listen to permanent offers for the Belgian and talks are ongoing between the two sides."
Manchester City offer Kyle Walker new contract to fend off Bayern Munich interest,"Jul 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/manchester-city-offer-kyle-walker-new-contract-bayern-munich,"Manchester City have offered a new contract to England defender Kyle Walker to try and convince him to stay at the club this summer, 90min understands. Walker has entered the final 12 months of his current deal and has been targeted by Bayern Munich, who are set for a change at right-back as Benjamin Pavard is keen to leave the Allianz Arena. The 33-year-old is yet to make a decision on his future. Being left out of the starting lineup for the Champions League final is understood to have hurt Walker and sparked questions over his continuation in Manchester. City are keen to see Walker make a decision soon and hope that the veteran defender chooses to stay. Sources have told 90min that the treble winners have extended an offer of a new contract to Walker to try and reaffirm their commitment to him. However, if Walker opts to pursue an exit instead, City will not stand in his way and will listen to offers. feed Walker is Bayern's top priority for their right-back spot although the Bundesliga giants have not yet ruled out a renewed offer for fellow City man Joao Cancelo, who spent the last six months on loan in Bavaria. There is also interest in Walker from Saudi Arabia but the former Tottenham man believes a move to the Middle East could harm his chances of starting for England at Euro 2024. Elsewhere, City have agreed terms with Southampton over the sale of 19-year-old midfielder Shea Charles, who is expected to move to St Mary's for around Â£10m. The Northern Ireland international made his senior debut off the bench in City's final Premier League game of the season against Brentford. Southampton have also expressed an interest in signing Premier League 2 player of the year Carlos Borges on loan and City are open to a temporary move for the 19-year-old winger, who also has interest from France, Germany and Portugal."
David de Gea confirms Manchester United exit,"Jul 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/david-de-gea-confirms-manchester-united-exit,"David de Gea has confirmed that he will leave Manchester United this summer after failing to agree the terms of a new contract. The goalkeeper's previous deal expired this summer and he was offered the chance to re-sign on significantly reduced terms, but De Gea has now confirmed that he will instead walk away from Old Trafford. ""I just wanted to send this farewell message to all Manchester United supporters,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""I would like to express my unwavering gratitude and appreciation for the love from the last 12 years. Weâve achieved a lot since my dear Sir Alex Ferguson brought me to this club. I took incredible pride every time I pulled on this shirt, to lead the team, to represent this institution, the biggest club in the world was an honour only bestowed upon a few lucky footballers. feed ""Itâs been an unforgettable and successful period since I came here. I didnât think from leaving Madrid as a young boy we would achieve what we did together. ""Now, itâs the right time to undertake a new challenge, to push myself again in new surroundings. ""Manchester will always be in my heart, Manchester has shaped me and will never leave me."" De Gea leaves United after 12 years at Old Trafford which yielded 545 appearances in all competitions and eight trophies, including the 2012/13 Premier League title. While United were hopeful of keeping De Gea, club officials have long been searching for a new high-level goalkeeper and are close to striking an agreement for Inter's Andre Onana. "
Why do top clubs want to sign Romeo Lavia?,"Jul 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/why-do-top-clubs-want-to-sign-romeo-lavia,"There were not many players who escaped from St Mary's Stadium with any credit in the bank last season. One that did, however, was Romeo Lavia. Southampton's dismal performances resulted in a deserved relegation from the Premier League and they now face the unenviable challenge of navigating the ruthless Championship in an attempt to return to the top tier.  The Saints will likely have a big budget to work with next campaign though, especially when the bidding war for young Lavia commences. The Belgian is wanted by Arsenal and Liverpool chiefly, but is also admired by a host of the world's biggest clubs. Southampton have no chance of holding onto their defensive-midfielder, nor will they particularly want to knowing the size of the transfer fee they can expect for him. An auction for Lavia appears increasingly imminent. But why is Lavia in such high-demand? Let's have a look at his strengths... A traditional number six, Lavia is not one for finding himself too far up the pitch. His greatest attributes are his defensive qualities, snapping into tackles and using his physicality to regain possession.  He averages 2.43 tackles per 90, as well as 1.34 interceptions and 1.9 blocks, highlighting his ability to screen a defence and stop danger at source. Lavia reads the game incredibly well for someone of such a tender age and stood out as Southampton's key performer alongside James Ward-Prowse last season. Having previously spoken of his idolisation of Fernandinho and the honour of getting to work with him, albeit briefly, you can see parallels between the pair.  Lavia also boasts a good passing range if not spectacularly efficient with an 86.2% accuracy in the Premier League last season. He was particularly adept at picking out medium and long passes when compared to his midfield peers.  Club Appearances Pass accuracy Tackles and interceptions Goals and assists Southampton 34 86.2% 93 2 The real question is who wouldn't want to sign Lavia? The answer: nobody.  However, it appears the Premier League's big dogs are the ones battling it out for his signature, with two clubs seemingly at the front of the queue.  Liverpool have shown significant interest in the youngster, with the Reds viewing Lavia as Fabinho's potential heir. Having already added Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai to their ranks, there are contrasting reports on whether or not Liverpool will bring a third midfielder to Anfield. Arsenal are the other club that have been most prominently linked with the Belgian. With an official announcement of Declan Rice imminent, there are question marks over whether the Gunners need another defensive midfielder. Granit Xhaka has already left the club and Thomas Partey could follow, in which case Mikel Arteta would definitely have to enter the market again. Keeping tabs on the starlet, Chelsea, Manchester United and Newcastle all remain in the loop. Newcastle's acquisition of Sandro Tonali may scupper plans for a move, while Chelsea's priority is Moises Caicedo. United would likely have to move on the likes of Fred or Scott McTominay to facilitate a move.  While unlikely, there is still the possibility that Lavia ends up at champions Manchester City. The treble-winners have a Â£40m buy-back clause in his contract having sold him to Southampton, but it does not become active until next summer and would obviously cease to exist should he move elsewhere this transfer window. feed Given City's buy-back clause, it is unlikely that Southampton would accept Â£40m or less for Lavia this summer. The Saints apparently want in excess of Â£50m for the midfielder and will be eager for as many clubs to show interest as possible to encourage a bidding war. Considering the south coast side only paid a maximum of Â£14m for Lavia, they will make a tidy profit on a player just a year after capturing his signature. For whoever comes in for the Saints' number 45, it will prove a worthwhile signing. "
Why would Man Utd want Andre Onana?,"Jul 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/why-would-man-utd-want-andre-onana,"There have been weeks of speculation surrounding Manchester United's goalkeeper search but it looks as if the Red Devils are finally going to land their priority target. With David de Gea now technically a free agent and a series of cryptic tweets from the Spaniard suggesting that contract negotiations over a new deal are not progressing, it looks more likely than ever that his 12-year Old Trafford career is coming to an end. Andre Onana is the man the Red Devils have turned to in order to fill De Gea's gloves, with the Inter goalkeeper having enjoyed a stellar season in Serie A and Europe. Despite having only been at San Siro since last summer, the Cameroonian is set to be on the move already. Manchester United have submitted a second bid for Onana, having seen the first one rebuffed, but still remain a distance from Inter's valuation. While there is optimism over the completion of a deal, there is still some way to go before Onana arrives in Manchester. But why are United so desperate to sign the 27-year-old? One of the key reasons why Erik ten Hag is keen to add Onana to his squad is due to the goalkeeper's technical prowess. The stopper is very comfortable with the ball at his feet and is a great distributor - exactly what Ten Hag demands of his man between the sticks. He attempted just over 36 passes per 90 minutes in Serie A last season, while Dea Gea averaged just over 27 in the Premier League, with Onana also boasting a 10.2% better pass accuracy than his Spanish counterpart.  Onana can more efficiently implement Ten Hag's passing philosophy at Old Trafford and would make United more press-resistant due to his ability to bypass the first wave of pressure with a long pass into midfield or the forward line. Last season's Champions League final perfectly exemplified the goalkeeper's technical talents.  First and foremost, however, Onana is there to keep the ball out of the net, something he does very well indeed. He has kept 104 clean sheets in his senior career at Ajax and Inter, averaging a shutout approximately every two-and-a-half games. Last campaign he boasted a 76.4% save percentage, showcasing his sharp reflexes and strong hands.  His 255 appearances at club level highlight his wealth of experience, especially considering he missed nine months of football after failing a drugs test, while his trophy cabinet points to a proven winner. Onana claimed two titles in his first season in Italy - the Coppa Italia and Supercoppa Italiana - and also won six pieces of silverware during his time at Ajax, including three Eredivisie crowns.  Club Appearances Goals conceded Clean sheets Inter 41 36 19 Ajax 214 192 85 feed After initially seeing a Â£38.5m bid rejected for Onana, there seems to be a large discrepancy between what United are offering and Inter's valuation of the player. The Italian side have always maintained that they would like upwards of Â£50m for the 34-cap international. United's second bid was made up of an upfront fee of Â£38.5m with Â£4.3m in potential add-ons and it is believed that Inter are still not content with such an offer. It is acknowledged that a fee of under Â£50m could now be reached with Inter keen to progress the deal quickly, although the structure of such a transfer may prove pivotal. Onana is eager to make the move to the Premier League and United are his priority choice despite links with Chelsea some time back. It appears his wishes will be granted imminently. "
Harry Kane to Chelsea? Mauricio Pochettino responds to transfer rumour,"Jul 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/harry-kane-chelsea-mauricio-pochettino-transfer,"Mauricio Pochettino has played down talk of a reunion with Harry Kane at Chelsea, but admitted he had an ""amazing relationship"" with the Tottenham striker when they worked together. Pochettino has taken over at Spurs' bitter London rivals, tasked with turning things around in west London after a disastrous 2022/23 campaign saw the Blues finish 12th. Heavy, heavy spending went unrewarded as Thomas Tuchel and Graham Potter were both sacked over the course of the season - Chelsea finished the campaign with Frank Lampard in caretaker charge. The summer transfer window has seen Chelsea ship out a number of players from their bloated squad - N'Golo Kante, Kalidou Koulibaly, Kai Havertz, Mateo Kovacic, Edouard Mendy, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Mason Mount and Cesar Azpilicueta have all left and will shortly be followed by Christian Pulisic - and Pochettino is acutely aware that he has a number of things still to address. In his opening press conference, the Argentine was inevitably asked about potential incomings at Chelsea, with Harry Kane among those to be mentioned. But Pochettino remained respectful of his situation at Spurs, distancing himself from the speculation of a potential transfer while communicating his belief at how good the 29-year-old is. ""I don't like to talk about players in another club, but you are talking about one of the greatest, one of the best strikers in the world. Itâs not fair to talk, itâs not fair to say nothing,"" Pochettino said. feed ""People are not stupid, fans are not stupid, they are so clever and they know my relationship with him was always amazing. I saw him when he was young, grow up and achieve all he was achieving and of course, we have a great relationship. At the moment we are thinking in different ways. We are not thinking about that.  ""Of course, working hard to try to provide the squad with good qualities. I donât like to talk about players and more than that players who were close to me."" Kane has just one year remaining on his Tottenham contract and 90min understands that he's reluctant to sign a new deal at this stage. Bayern Munich have courted Kane all summer long, while Manchester United were interested before learning of Spurs chairman Daniel Levy's Â£100m+ asking price. England's captain currently sits on 213 Premier League goals, the second most ever, and trails Alan Shearer's record of 260 by just 47 - something he could achieve in the next two years if he continues scoring at the rate he has done over the past nine seasons."
Barcelona set to confirm Vitor Roque signing despite late interest,"Jul 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-to-confirm-vitor-roque-signing,"Barcelona are ready to announce the signing of teenage forward Vitor Roque from Athletico Paranaense, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Catalan giants have agreed a deal worth â¬40m for the 18-year-old, who made his senior international debut for Brazil in March, but don't intend for him to arrive at Camp Nou until 2024. There had been suggestions that Athletico were not prepared to wait until next year, instead pushing Barcelona to complete the transfer this summer. 90min understands that remains an option if last season's La Liga winners can generate cash through player sales, but the move will otherwise go through as planned. Arsenal, Tottenham, Chelsea and Bayern Munich all made contact with Athletico, 90min further understands, to ascertain whether a deal was still there to be done, but Roque has long decided that he wants to join Barcelona. Roque has agreed a contract until 2028 and is scheduled to link up with Barcelona in January, which could provide Xavi with some much needed firepower for the second half of next season. feed Barcelona anticipate having cleared space on their wage bill by that point, with a number of players on the chopping block this summer as president Joan Laporta looks to balance the club's delicate financials. ""I hope he will become my teammate at Barcelona. We're talking about a high quality football player. He'd help Barca a lot,"" Brazil international team-mate Raphinha recently said of Roque - ironically the winger could be one of the players ushered out of the door if a suitable bid is received. Raphinha wants to stay at Barcelona for the long-term, as does Ferran Torres, but sources have confirmed to 90min that the club are in no position to turn down offers if they come in. Ansu Fati is in a similar situation while Ousmane Dembele, who is a player Xavi considers to be 'untouchable', may also see his future analysed interest from Paris Saint-Germain. As for Roque, he has already helped Brazil win the South American Under-20s Championship, and was also named in the 2022 Copa Libertadores Team of the Tournament."

Five defensive midfielders Barcelona should be trying to sign this summer,"Jul 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/five-defensive-midfielders-barcelona-should-trying-sign-this-summer,"Sergio Busquets' departure from Camp Nou this summer has left Barcelona with an enormous hole to fill. For the last 15 years, Busquets' metronomic vision and control have been integral to Barcelona's identity. His loss is a huge one which is perhaps only exceeded by Lionel Messi's exit in 2021. Manager Xavi has spoken openly about the importance of signing a new defensive midfielder this summer. Ilkay Gundogan has arrived to bolster further forwards, but at the base of midfield, questions remain. While Frenkie de Jong can take the role, the Dutchman would be wasted in such a position and so Barcelona should be looking to dip their toes into the transfer market, although their woeful financial situation will severely limit their options. With all that in mind, here are five players Barcelona should be looking at. Age: 31Club: Girona A cheap, plug-and-play option would be 31-year-old Oriol Romeu, whose release clause of under â¬10m immediately makes him an appealing prospect. Romeu spent this past season shining at the base of a Girona midfield that was among La Liga's most exciting, and while he might not be a perfect replacement for Busquets, there's no denying he can do a job at a high level. At 31, he'd be a short-term solution but Barcelona may actually prefer that. After all, finding the right player for this role is crucial and there's no point rushing this decision if the perfect candidate is not currently attainable. As a former La Masia graduate, Romeu already knows the DNA of Barcelona and is one of a limited number of options who wouldn't need time to get up to speed. Age: 26Club: Fiorentina The World Cup was perhaps the best thing to happen to Sofyan Amrabat as the Morocco star used the global stage to raise his profile tenfold. After impressing in Qatar, Amrabat's performances have continued to attract plenty of praise. He's an excellent passer who loves to sit deep and pull the strings, which is the simplest essence of the Busquets role. With just 12 months left on his contract and a clear stance that he will not be renewing, Amrabat looks likely to be sold this summer and will likely be available on the cheap as a result. Reports have suggested Amrabat is prioritising a move to Barcelona over interest from a number of other suitors, so the Blaugrana may not even need to work hard to get this one over the line. feed Age: 24Club: Real Sociedad As far as replacements for Busquets go, there are few players who look more suited for the role than Real Sociedad's Martin Zubimendi. The 24-year-old is incredibly intelligent and looks exactly like the sort of player Barcelona want to build around, and club officials are well aware of that. They've been looking at Zubimendi for months, but all that research has unearthed a real problem - his release clause. Sociedad do not want to let him go and will therefore direct any suitors to his â¬60m release clause, which is a reasonable figure for someone of Zubimendi's talent but also wildly out of Barcelona's budget. If they can sell enough players to raise the money, or perhaps even offer those players to Sociedad in exchange, this is a deal worth pursuing. Age: 22Club: Boca Juniors Spanish sides are never scared to pluck talents from South America, and that bravery should see them move for Boca's Alan Varela. A composed defender who has already mastered the art of scanning, Varela looks like a future superstar in this role. Barcelona could easily put the finishing touches on his game and turn him into an elite midfielder. He's obviously an enormous risk, having never played outside of Argentina, but Varela's play style is a fascinating one which echoes a lot of what fans have grown to love from Busquets. A number of teams from across Europe have taken notice of Varela's skill set and he may not be on the market for much longer. For a team in Barcelona's perilous financial position, this may be the final chance they have to sign Varela. Age: 23Club: Valencia A centre-back by trade, Hugo Guillamon has been pushed into a defensive midfield role in the past few years, and although his transition hasn't been perfect, the 23-year-old has shown more than enough to convince Barcelona of his worth. Smart in possession and more than happy to help out in defence, Guillamon is an intriguing option who has often been used in defence on the international stage because of the sheer level of competition in defensive midfield.  Guillamon is under contract until 2026 but Valencia's well-known financial struggles mean nearly any player can be picked up on the cheap, so this is a real opportunity for Barcelona to bag themselves a bargain. Xavi would need to afford Guillamon time to adjust to such a high level, but the rewards of doing so could be huge."
Chelsea agree fee with AC Milan over Christian Pulisic,"Jul 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-agree-fee-ac-milan-christian-pulisic,"Christian Pulisic is set to become the second Chelsea player to join AC Milan this summer after the two clubs agreed a fee for his transfer, 90min understands. The American winger had received an approach from Ligue 1 side Lyon but was solely focused on moving to Milan, with Chelsea recently agreeing to drop their asking price to encourage a second bid from the Rossoneri. Sources have now confirmed to 90min that an agreement has been reached over a fee which is understood to sit around the Â£20m mark, including bonuses, to take Pulisic to San Siro this summer. Milan agreed personal terms with Pulisic earlier this month and are now set to close the deal in the coming days. The two clubs have already done business this summer, with Ruben Loftus-Cheek making the move in June, and now Pulisic is set for a reunion with both the midfielder and Chelsea academy graduate Fikayo Tomori. feed A medical has now been scheduled for Pulisic who, if all goes to plan, will see his four-year association with Chelsea come to an end this summer. Pulisic joined Chelsea in January 2019 for a fee of Â£58m, remaining with Borussia Dortmund for the next six months before eventually moving to Stamford Bridge, but the 24-year-old has struggled with both form and fitness during his time in London. He has managed 145 appearances in all competitions, chipping in with 26 goals and 21 assists, but rarely saw an extended run of starts. Pulisic, whose Croatian passport helps Milan meet their non-EU rules, enjoyed an excellent post-lockdown streak in the second half of the prolonged 2019/20 campaign, bagging four goals and four assists in nine outings, and will now hope to bring that form to Milan.

Man Utd hold talks with Atalanta over Mason Greenwood loan deal,"Jul 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-talks-atalanta-mason-greenwood-loan-deal,"Manchester United have held talks with Atalanta over a potential loan deal for Mason Greenwood, 90min understands. Greenwood has been suspended by United since January 30, 2022, after being charged with attempted rape, engaging in controlling and coercive behaviour and assault.  Charges against Greenwood were dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service in February but the player remained suspended by United for the remainder of last season, as the club conducted an internal investigation. The 22-year-old is contracted to United until June 2025 with the club holding an option to extend that contract by a further year. United have been considering how to proceed with the 21-year-old and 90min has learned United have held discussions with Atalanta over potentially sending the player on loan to Serie A, those discussions coming during talks between the two clubs over the potential transfer of primary United striking target Rasmus Hojlund. feed Talks have been held about United's potential purchase of Hojlund with Greenwood sent on loan to Bergamo in part exchange, though it's understood that Atletico Madrid have enquired about Greenwood and Borussia Dortmund have held interest. Greenwood has been pictured training on his own in recent weeks and has not returned to United for the commencement of their pre-season. United have pursued a deal for Hojlund in recent weeks after being deterred in their pursuit of England captain Harry Kane by Tottenham's refusal to sell. 90min reported in recent days that talks were ongoing with Atalanta over the Danish striker, though their asking price of â¬75m-â¬80m was proving prohibitive - with United looking at a deal in the region of a maximum â¬60m. Talks are ongoing and United are optimistic they are able to strike a deal for Hojlund that suits them before the new season begins. Erik ten Hag and United are also closing in on a deal for Inter goalkeeper Andre Onana, after seeing two bids rejected for the player this week. United have already confirmed the signing of Mason Mount from Chelsea."
Arda Guler confirms decision on loan away from Real Madrid,"Jul 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arda-guler-confirms-decision-loan-real-madrid,"Real Madrid signing Arda Guler has ruled out immediately leaving the club on loan following completion of his â¬20m transfer from Fenerbahce. Guler has put pen to paper on a six-year contract with Real and has been assigned the clubâs number 24 shirt for the forthcoming season. But having only turned 18 in February and with just 51 senior club games under his belt, there have already been doubts about his playing time. In a similar position after arriving from Brazil aged 18, Vinicius Junior initially started out with Real Madrid Castilla. Martin Odegaard was younger, just 16, when he joined Los Blancos, but also went down the path of playing games for the junior squad. Within a couple of months his debut season starting, Vinicius was getting first-team chances though. In Madrid to undergo his medical and officially sign his contract at the Bernabeu alongside club president Florentino Perez, Guler was also presented to the media. He was bullish about his hopes amid significant competition for places in midfield. ""I won't leave on loan, this is not an option. I want to stay and play for Real Madrid,"" he said. ""I'm ready to compete and I'm going to earn my position, I'm going to give it everything to earn my place at the club. I want to stay and play here. If I get a chance to play I will take it. I'm not contemplating any other possibility. I've been offered to play and that's what I'm going to do."" feed Guler, a central midfielder, represents the future with Real. Toni Kroos and Luka Modric have each signed new contracts since the end of last season, but at 33 and almost 38 respectively, neither living legend will be part of the squad for much longer. Kroos has often hinted about retiring in 2024. Real had already moved this summer to bring down the age of the group, signing Jude Bellingham in a transfer that could surpass â¬130m. Eduardo Camavinga and Aurelien Tchouameni, 20 and 23 respectively, have also both been signed within the last two years. Guler is looking forward to sharing a dressing room with Modric, while he also has a pre-existing relationship with former Real star Mesut Ozil. ""For me,Â ModricÂ is the best midfielder in the world and I'm going to take this opportunity to learn everything from him. I have a lot of respect for him,"" the teenager said. ""[Ozil] told me thatÂ Real MadridÂ is the greatest club in the world. We have a brotherly relationship and he's always spoken highly of the club and given me good advice."""
Moises Caicedo speaks out on Chelsea transfer interest,"Jul 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/moises-caicedo-speaks-chelsea-transfer-interest,"Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo has admitted he is enjoying being in the headlines this summer as Chelsea continue to push for his signature. The Blues are preparing an opening bid for Caicedo but face a battle to convince Brighton to lower their asking price. A price tag of Â£100m has been placed on the Ecuador international's head, with Brighton pointing to Declan Rice's imminent Â£105m move to Arsenal for justification. Chelsea are prepared to pay a huge sum for Caicedo but just how high they will go is unclear, and this is a saga which could easily rumble on all summer. Asked about his time in the spotlight, Caicedo admitted he is enjoying it and doing his best to stay grounded. ""It's a very great emotion,"" he told Maria Jose Flores. ""What guy wouldn't want them to be talking about him? feed ""I know how to handle it. I don't get carried away by emotions. I'm enjoying time with my family for now. There is pressure, but I am calm. I am waiting for whatever God decides. He will know what is best for me."" Caicedo also took the opportunity to talk about fellow Independiente del Valle product Kendry Paez, who will join Chelsea in the summer of 2025 when he turns 18. ""Kendry is a star,"" Caicedo admitted. ""Watching him play is a pleasure. ""It's good to see those talents in Ecuador. We know that we have good youth. I am very happy for him, for everything he is doing, for how he is working. May he continue on the right path and go far. He has the talent."""
Five strikers Man Utd should be trying to sign this summer,"Jul 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/five-strikers-man-utd-should-trying-sign-this-summer,"Manchester United have signed midfielder Mason Mount and are closing in on goalkeeper Andre Onana, but there's a real need for Erik ten Hag to sign a new striker. Wout Weghorst was drafted in on an emergency loan deal in January, providing some relief for Ten Hag, but he was never going to be the long-term solution at Old Trafford. Marcus Rashford scored 30 goals in all competitions to paper over some of the cracks, but Anthony Martial's continued struggles with injuries and form mean the time is now for United to source a proper replacement. Harry Kane and Victor Osimhen have at one time or another been United's top target, but their extortionate asking prices - coupled with the Red Devils' need to complete other business - means moves for them are almost certainly off the table. But a move must be made somewhere, leaving United searching for the next best fit. Here's five strikers who could fit the brief... Age: 21Club: Atalanta A player being billed as the next big thing is Atalanta and Denmark striker Rasmus Hojlund. 6'3 tall, built powerfully and very adept with the ball at his feet, Hojlund has only been in Italy for one season after Atalanta snatched him from the clutches of Sturm Graz in August.  But in that short space of time, Hojlund has shown incredible promise and tremendous technical ability, leading his manager Gian Piero Gasperini to describe his quality as ""remarkable"". He's also blindingly quick off the mark and a real danger when running in behind defences - often overlooking a simple pass to a team-mate in favour of taking on the opposition. Hojlund likes getting involved in play, dropping deep to link up with midfield, and his aggressive style, coupled with his appetite for pressing, appears to align with what Ten Hag is looking for. The goals are not there yet - the Dane scored just nine in Serie A last season - but it feels like a matter of time before he starts tearing defences apart. Indeed, six goals on the international stage - including a hat-trick against Finland in Copenhagen - indicates Hojlund's time is coming. Age: 23Club: Juventus Dusan Vlahovic is another striker currently plying his trade in Serie A, but things have not turned out as many thought they would when the Serb rocked up at Juventus. The 23-year-old scored 44 goals in 98 games for Fiorentina - form that convinced Juve to part with â¬70m and an expensive four-and-a-half year contract. But amid rumours of a broken down relationship with manager Max Allegri, Vlahovic scored just 14 times during 2022/23 at a rate of one goal every three games. That may not sound overly positive for Manchester United supporters, but Vlahovic undoubtedly still has huge potential. A clinical finisher, he can fashion opportunities for himself with quick feet and thrives off quick interchanges - attributes that would likely help Rashford maintain his levels from last season and draw the best from Bruno Fernandes. It's increasingly likely Vlahovic will be available to move this summer, so United may end up thinking he's too good to overlook. feed Age: 20Club: RB Leipzig Benjamin Sesko is a player Manchester United have been tracking for a number of months, even though he's just rocked up in Germany to join RB Leipzig from sister club Salzburg. The 20-year-old has been tipped to go to the very top of the game - drawing comparisons with Erling Haaland's rapid rise - and his â¬24m move to Leipzig suggests there's confidence from coaches that he may just do that. Sesko stands 6'5 tall, inevitably making him a huge threat in the penalty area. But his physical presence and aerial dominance is supplemented by a tremendous shot on goal, while he's also not afraid to press opposition defences and drop deep to link up play. Prising him away from Leipzig would appear to be impossible, but there was significant talk of United, and others, looking to offer the Bundesliga outfit a rapid profit.  Age: 22Club: Benfica With Cristiano Ronaldo's benching at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar stealing the headlines, Portugal needed some inspiration from elsewhere to turn an overwhelming negatively situation back into a positive. Enter, Goncalo Ramos. A hat-trick against Switzerland later followed, in a domestic season where Ramos really flourished for Benfica. Filling the boots of Darwin Nunez, who had departed for Liverpool, the 22-year-old scored 19 Primeira Liga goals and 27 in all competitions to establish himself as one of Europe's finest young guns. Ramos is a hard worker, physically strong and able to get around the pitch, and also an intelligent footballer who gets into good goalscoring positions. He also appears to have tremendous composure - something you need in spades to cope with the pressure of playing for United. Age: 25Club: Inter After five seasons at Inter, Lautaro Martinez appears to be nearing the end of his journey at San Siro amid interest from some of Europe's biggest clubs. Chelsea are among those taking a keen interest in the Argentine World Cup winner, no doubt because he's just come off the back of the best goalscoring season of his career. Martinez bagged 28 goals in all competitions for Inter, but it's his ability to play as an advanced forward or in a more withdrawn role that should peak the interest of United. Martinez makes smart runs, in behind and out into the channels, and has tremendous awareness of what's going on around him. The 25-year-old's movements are subtle but also generate space for others to flourish. He previously forged one of world football's most devastating strike duos alongside Romelu Lukaku, but has shown he can play the lead role up front on his own. Martinez feels ready to take on a new challenge, and even though his asking price would be at the higher end of United's budget, his credentials speak for themselves."
PSG confirm Manuel Ugarte signing from Sporting CP,"Jul 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-confirm-manuel-ugarte-signing-sporting-cp,"Paris Saint-Germain have confirmed the signing of defensive midfielder Manuel Ugarte from Sporting CP on a five-year contract. The 22-year-old is an eight-time Uruguay international and had attracted interest from Premier League side Chelsea before deciding to move to France. PSG wrapped up personal terms with Ugarte in May while the Blues elected to move onto other targets including Moises Caicedo and Romeo Lavia. On his move to the Ligue 1 champions, Ugarte said: ""I'm really happy to take this big step in my career at such a great club. ""I'm going to give my all for Paris Saint-Germain."" Ugarte becomes PSG's third signing in as many days after deals were wrapped up for free agents Marco Asensio and Milan Skriniar. Lionel Messi and Sergio Ramos have departed, while there remains intense speculation over the future of Kylian Mbappe. feed The midfielder will wear the number four shirt in Paris and arrives after two seasons with Sporting where he won the 2021/22 Taca da Liga. Ugarte made 85 appearances for the Portuguese side in total, having previously impressed for Famalicao after breaking through at Fenix in Uruguay. He will be managed by new head coach Luis Enrique in his first club role since leaving Barcelona in 2017. Ugarte was also included in his country's squad for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar but didn't play a competitive minute as Uruguay were knocked out in the group stages."
The 10 most expensive English players of all time,"Jul 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/10-most-expensive-english-players-all-time,"A stubborn West Ham were determined to garner a British record fee for stalwart captain Declan Rice. The Premier League's leading clubs as well as an overseas juggernaut in Bayern Munich made their interest in the midfielder well-known, with Arsenal and Man City eventually duelling in a surprisingly entertaining race for Rice's signature. The saga concluded rather swiftly with Arsenal agreeing to smash their record transfer fee to bring Rice to north London and the England international has also become the most expensive British player of all-time. Deep down, Pep Guardiola always knew Stones would evolve into his current imperious iteration when City spent Â£47.5m to sign him from Everton in 2016.Raw but blessed with bags of talent, it hasn't always been plain sailing for Stones in Manchester, but he's now regarded as one of the very best defenders around following another excellent season.His unique hybrid role played a key role in City's treble triumph.  Sterling's Â£47.5m move to Chelsea just misses out on the top ten, but the winger's first major transfer does make the list. The spritely dribbler burst onto the scene under Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool and quickly became regarded as one of the country's brightest talents following an excellent 2013/14 season. He'd spend another year at Anfield before the newly forming monopolisers of the Premier League swooped in 2015.  Arsenal's recruitment has been spot on over the past couple of years and their summer window of 2022 was a watershed period in the club's rise under Mikel Arteta.Brighton defender White was the showpiece signing and it didn't take long for the athletic, technically proficient centre-back to settle in north London. His game was taken to another level in 2022/23 as Arteta successfully converted him into an up and down right-back. Man Utd are synonymous with boasting England's finest talent and the club have continued in their attempts to snag the very best the country's got. However, their hit rate in terms of big-money English signings is pretty poor. While Wan-Bissaka impressed at Crystal Palace, his woes in possession always rendered him a questionable fit for a club of United's stature.The right-back has produced some remarkable defensive performances for the Red Devils, but not enough to justify his Â£50m fee.  Sealed with a handshake ð¤#MUFC United's 2023 summer transfer window kicked off with the Â£60m arrival of Mount from Chelsea. A player that divides opinion, the crafty creator is bound to fit right in at Old Trafford. His supreme athleticism, relentless running out of possession and wily positioning render him a distinct upgrade for Erik ten Hag in midfield. United supporters will hope he doesn't endure a similar fate to the vast majority of the club's priciest arrivals. feed The dullest of transfer sagas that spanned several windows concluded with Sancho joining United for just shy of Â£73m.The Englishman dazzled in the space haven that is the Bundesliga with Borussia Dortmund, but Sancho is yet to marvel in the Premier League. Sure, he perhaps hasn't been given the best conditions to excel, but time is seemingly running out for the creative wide man to shine.  While Maguire had stood out in the top flight with Hull and Leicester, very few regarded the vintage centre-half as a Â£78m defender. Supreme in the air and comfortable enough in possession, Maguire is a good defender who has persistently impressed for the national team. However, his struggles defending in a high line has seen his flaws manifest at Old Trafford with Ten Hag reducing his minutes during his first season at the club. The aura of a superstar. Bellingham has long been destined for stardom and he couldn't have picked a better club to harbour his development than Borussia Dortmund. The midfielder evolved from a boy into a man at BVB, with his majestic work on the field catching the eye of the footballing world. Bellingham's now a fully fledged England international and is poised to develop into Real Madrid's next Galactico after joining for Â£88.5m. The loveable wide man put Aston Villa on his back and steered them to Premier League safety during the 2019/20 season before enjoying another productive campaign in 2020/21.A big move away from Villa Park became inevitable and Man City opted to splash what was then a British record fee to bring Grealish and his bulging calves to the Etihad. After a quiet debut season, Grealish was excellent in year two as City claimed a historic treble.  Grealish's transfer record lasted just two summers. Arsenal's core is tinged with supreme English talent and Mikel Arteta firmly believes Declan Rice could be the transformative signing that could catapult the Gunners to Premier League glory.A hotly-contested race for Rice's signature concluded with Arsenal paying a British record Â£105m to prise the midfielder away from West Ham's grasp.  Rank Player Joined Fee 1. Declan Rice Arsenal Â£105m 2. Jack Grealish Man City Â£100m 3. Jude Bellingham Real Madrid Â£88.5m 4. Harry Maguire Man Utd Â£78m 5. Jadon Sancho Man Utd Â£72.9m 6. Mason Mount Man Utd Â£60m 7. Aaron Wan-Bissaka Man Utd Â£50m 8. Ben White Arsenal Â£50m 9. Raheem Sterling Man City Â£49m 10. John Stones"
Inter Miami to sign Jordi Alba on a free transfer ,"Jul 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/inter-miami-to-sign-jordi-alba-free-transfer,"Sources close to 90min confirm Jordi Alba is to join Inter Miami on a free transfer, reuniting with former Barcelona team-mates Lionel Messi and Sergio Busquets. The Major League Soccer side began pursuing the Spaniard weeks ago, after Alba confirmed his departure from Barcelona following the expiration of his contract. He leaves La Liga with 459 appearances to his name over the course of 11 years. Heâs the latest bombshell signing for Inter Miami, who have decided to revamp their roster during the leagueâs Secondary Transfer Window. The Herons first announced Lionel Messi on June 7, after the player revealed his commitment to feature for the Eastern Conference team in a televised interview.Â  ""I made the decision that I am going to go to Miami,"" Messi said. ""I still haven't closed it one hundred percent. I'm missing some things but we decided to continue the path."" Inter Miami then confirmed the arrival of Sergio Busquets a couple weeks later, before revealing Gerardo âTataâ Martino as the newest head coach to lead the Barcelona duo. Now, Alba will join his former team-mates in the hunt for the MLS Cup.Â  The three played together in La Liga from 2012 to 2021, winning five league titles, six Copa del Rey trophies and one Champions League trophy. The reinforcements will serve Miami well, as they sit in last place of the Eastern Conference table with a mere 17 points in 20 games and a 5W-13L-2D record. The team is almost mathematically disqualified from reaching the MLS playoffs, unable to climb to one of the top nine places on the table.Â "
Real Madrid transfers: Positions Los Blancos must strengthen before summer deadline,"Jul 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/real-madrid-transfers-positions-strengthen-before-summer-deadline,"Real Madrid very rarely find themselves in a transfer window desperately needing to make signings. Generally, squad planning is good and deals are wrapped up very swiftly. One area that needed some attention was midfield, but Jude Bellingham arrived from Borussia Dortmund very early in the window to tick that box.  They have also secured a deal for Turkish youngster Arda Guler who can provide cover in the attack and the midfield if he is not loaned out.  There remain areas that need addressing for Los Blancos as the summer wears on and they will need to start moving fairly swiftly. The good news is a lot of time in the window remains and few clubs can match Real's pulling power. This is the major transfer Real Madrid need to make. They have lost Karim Benzema who has led the line for many years and the current strikers in the squad won't do the job all year long. They signed Joselu who has to be viewed as a depth option, but right now he is the only proper striker around.  The two major central forwards on the market this summer are Harry Kane and Victor Osimhen. Kane seems much closer to Bayern Munich and Manchester United remain an option, while no club is closing in on Osimhem yet and the Serie A champions may be unable to fend Real off if a bid near â¬150m comes in. It's a bit of a surprise Real haven't been more heavily linked with either striker, but something has to change in the coming weeks. Lille's Jonathan David has also been mentioned but, while very highly rated, it's hard to picture Real starting a new season without an elite striker. A loan for Dusan Vlahovic is an option as a stop-gap before Kylian Mbappe's possible arrival next summer. This is not an area Real need massive new signings in, but they do need bodies. Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo are the current first choice wingers but depth is lacking after that. Brahim Diaz is back but more of a central figure, while Federico Valverde and Lucas Vazquez have fill in when necessary. The idea of a move suddenly being made for Mbappe can't be fully ruled out, while Bernardo Silva is open to leaving Manchester City though is being pursued by Paris Saint-Germain. Villarreal's Samuel Chukwueze is another winger that could make sense, but AC Milan are pushing hard to sign the Nigerian who has one year left on his contract. feed The major name that has been mentioned at left back is Alphonso Davies.  This was a problem position for Carlo Ancelotti last season with Ferland Mendy out of action with a long-term injury. He will be back on the scene next season, but more depth and quality would be ideal. Fran Garcia is now back at the club and can play there, but the opportunity to secure a player like Davies would hardly be a bad idea for Real. There has to be a future without Dani Carvajal and that future is arriving quickly. Alvaro Odriozola is expected to leave this summer and while there are players who can provide depth at right back in the squad, fresh quality could be required. There are quite a lot of available right backs out there for a club like Real Madrid, with Kyle Walker a genuine possibility. Reece James may also be open to a move away from Chelsea this summer and the idea of bringing Achraf Hakimi back from PSG is also not being ruled out."

Real Madrid's stance on Federico Valverde transfer amid widespread interest,"Jul 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/real-madrid-stance-federico-valverde-transfer-liverpool-chelsea-man-city-bayern-munich,"Real Madrid and Federico Valverde are not looking to part ways this summer, despite strong interest in the versatile Uruguay star, 90min understands. Valverde is widely regarded as one of Real's most important players following a breakout season, but speculation over his future has ensued given summer arrivals of Jude Bellingham and Arda Guler, and the ongoing possibity of also signing PSG superstar Kylian Mbappe. Yet sources close to Real have insisted to 90min that selling the 24-year-old is not in their plans. They would not entertain a sale any time soon and point to the fact he has a â¬1bn release clause in his current contract that runs until 2027. feed Real's stance on the matter has still not stopped other clubs taking an interest and asking about his availability. 90min understands that Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City have enquired this summer, along with Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain - but none of those informal approaches were received positively and were immediately dismissed. Valverde's representatives have also been contacted by the interested parties, but they have been quick to relay the message straight from the player that he has no desire to move. Valverde's wife has just given birth to their second child and he has no desire to uproot his family out of Madrid. A sources close to the player has also informed 90min that he one day sees himself as a future Real captain and that he could imagine spending the rest of his career with the Spanish giants - that potentially means another decade or more at the Santiago Bernabeu. Valverde has been with Madrid for seven years already after joining them from Penarol and has already amassed more than 200 appearances since making his first-team debut in 2018."
"Liverpool, Arsenal & Chelsea shaping up for transfer battle over Southampton star","Jul 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-arsenal-chelsea-shaping-up-transfer-battle-southampton-romeo-lavia,"Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea have all held talks over a possible deal for in-demand Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia in recent weeks, 90min understands. 90min understands that, as it stands, Southampton firmly believe their valuation in excess of Â£50m is fair price. More importantly, they also think it is an attainable number given the interest that is emerging in the teenage Belgian international.  Leading suitors Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea all have Lavia on their respective lists.  Liverpool have already made in-roads into their midfield overhaul with the signings of Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai, but they want more. They have looked closely at the likes of Nice's Khephren Thuram, Borussia Monchengladbach's Manu Kone and Ryan Gravenberch of Bayern Munich - but Lavia with his existing Premier League experience is now under consideration. Arsenal are set to announce the signing of Declan Rice, but with Granit Xhaka set to leave and the futures of Thomas Partey and Jorginho far from certain, they have plans to further bolster their midfield. Those plans include Lavia and 90min revealed last month they have already held talks. feed Chelsea are going for Moises Caicedo and are preparing to make an opening offer, as 90min has revealed. But they are still looking at other options as their midfield is in need of a boost in numbers following the departures of Mason Mount, Mateo Kovacic, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and N'Golo Kante. Chelsea also have Joe Shields, co-Director of Recruitment and Talent, who was the man who took Lavia to Southampton from Manchester City last summer, prior to taking a job at Stamford Bridge, and he is pushing hard for his new club to make an approach. Aside from Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea, there is further interest in Lavia. 90min understands that his former club Manchester City - who have a buy-back in 2024 - are being kept aware of the situation, along with Manchester United and Newcastle, who could very well open talks too. However, all the clubs interested are believed to be unsure of Southampton's current Â£50m+ valuation of the player - the Saints only paid Â£10m plus another Â£4m in add-ons for Lavia. As it stands it is not believed any club is willing to reach that mark. 90min understands that Lavia and his team have so far not indicated any preference as to where he wants to move, but they are very happy with the extent and calibre of the clubs interested. Lavia wants his future resolving before the start of the season as he isn't keen to play in the Championship."
Inter chief confirms stance on Romelu Lukaku signing and Andre Onana sale,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/inter-romelu-lukaku-signing-andre-onana-sale,"Inter sporting director Piero Ausilio has spoken out on the future of Romelu Lukaku. 30-year-old Lukaku spent the 2022/23 on loan at Inter, returning to the club where he formed a formidable strike partnership with Lautaro Martinez, and scored 14 goals in all competitions as the Nerazzurri reached the Champions League final. 90min recently revealed that Inter and Chelsea, Lukaku's parent club, were close to agreeing a deal that would send the Belgian back to San Siro once more, with the Blues willing to sanction a loan deal with an obligation to buy. Chelsea had been been to sell Lukaku on a permanent basis this summer, but recognise that Inter's precarious financial situation means only a loan will be possible. Lukaku has publicly stated his desire to return to Milan already, and sporting director Ausilio has now confirmed Inter's intention to return him to the club. âLukaku is one of our important objectives. The whole sporting department wants him at Inter,"" Ausilio said. âBut for now heâs a Chelsea player. The dialogue remains open. They donât want to send the player on loan. They said we must buy him. So we are now evaluating whether there is a possibility to sign him outright. âI donât like talking about priorities. Lukaku knows very well that we want to bring him back here. Letâs see if we can find a solution.â  feed Manchester United have made a second offer for Inter goalkeeper Andre Onana, 90min understands, worth around â¬50m. Inter have already rejected one bid from United worth a total of â¬45m, but United have returned with an improved offer in the hope of landing the Cameroonian international. It's believed that Inter are unlikely to accept United's latest offer - they value Onana at closer to â¬60m - but there could be a compromise found in order to ease the Italian giants' financial concerns. Prior to the bid being received, Ausilio revealed that United were yet to present an offer that ""met expectations"" and confirmed there would be no movement until Inter were entirely satisfied. âRight now, Onana is Interâs goalkeeper. Heâs one of the strengths of the team and we would like to continue with strong players,"" he said. âIf opportunities arise, weâll evaluate and listen, but up till now, they havenât arrived or havenât met our expectations. âOnanaâs topic ends here. The pre-season starts on July 13 and he will rejoin the group. If something comes up in the next 15-20 days, we will evaluate it. Right now there are no dates or deadlines or the desire to deprive ourselves of any player.â"
Manchester City pushing to finalise Josko Gvardiol agreement,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/manchester-city-pushing-finalise-josko-gvardiol-agreement,"Manchester City are pushing hard to finalise a deal for RB Leipzig defender Josko Gvardiol, sources have told 90min. The 21-year-old has emerged as one of City's primary transfer targets this summer, and talks have been ongoing with Leipzig over a deal that would make the Croatian the most expensive defender of all time. Personal terms are all but agreed with Gvardiol, who has made it clear to Leipzig that he wants to join the champions of Europe. Leipzig have publicly stated that City will need to fork out close to â¬100m (Â£86m) plus add-ons in order to land Gvardiol, and last season's treble winners recognise that they will need to make him the most expensive defender ever, eclipsing the Â£80m fee neighbourhood rivals Manchester United paid Leicester for Harry Maguire in 2019. If and when the deal is finalised, Gvardiol will become City's second most expensive acquisition - Jack Grealish's Â£100m move from Aston Villa being the current club record. feed 90min understands that City feel a deal is close, but it is the overall structure of payments that still needs to be ironed out. Nevertheless, there is an expectation from all parties that a deal will be completed before City travel to Asia for a pre-season tour later this month - their first game is in Tokyo against Yokohama F. Marinos on July 23rd. Leipzig, while standing firm on their valuation, are already sourcing potential replacements for Gvardiol, and sources have confirmed that talks are at advanced stage with Feyenoord over Dutch defender Lutsharel Geertruida. The highly-rated 22-year-old is valued in excess of â¬25m by the Eredivisie champions, who have already turned down two bids from Leipzig. But Geertruida is believed to have accepted the personal terms on offer to him in the Bundesliga and is keen to make the move."
West Ham exploring Denis Zakaria loan deal; Gianluca Scamacca no closer to exit,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-denis-zakaria-loan-gianluca-scamacca,"West Ham United will hold talks with Juventus over a loan deal for Denis Zakaria, 90min understands, as the club prepare for Declan Rice's departure. Rice will undergo a medical with Arsenal on Friday after the Hammers agreed a deal worth Â£105m, a record transfer for a British player, to bring to an end to weeks of speculation. The 24-year-old's exit should give West Ham plenty of wiggle room in the transfer market, with the club fully intending to strengthen their squad after qualifying for next season's Europa League. Talks are advancing between West Ham and Leicester over wide forward Harvey Barnes, although a deal is complicated by strong interest from Newcastle and Aston Villa, while there's also genuine interest in Ajax's Edson Alvarez, who saw a move to Borussia Dortmund break down recently. Joao Palhinha, Kalvin Phillips and Amadou Onana are three other players West Ham have identified as potential Rice replacements, but sources have confirmed to 90min that a loan deal for Zakaria, with an option to buy, is being strongly considered. Zakaria has played just 15 times for Juventus in all competitions after joining from Borussia Monchengladbach in January 2022, and spent last season on loan at Chelsea. He failed to make much of an impact though, appearing in just seven Premier League games before returning to Turin. feed West Ham will not allow Gianluca Scamacca to join Roma or any other interested club until they have a concrete replacement lined up. The 24-year-old signed a five-year contract at London Stadium last summer, joining from Sassuolo in a deal worth around Â£35m. But the Italian has struggled to make an impact at West Ham and struggled with injuries in his debut season. Scamacca featured in just 16 Premier League games, scoring three goals, and appeared to struggle with West Ham's counter attacking style of play, which often saw him isolated as David Moyes set his side up to absorb pressure. Beaten Europa League finalists Roma, who are managed by Jose Mourinho, are interested in signing Scamacca after Tammy Abraham suffered a nasty ACL tear in the Italian's final Serie A game of 2022/23, initially on loan. But 90min understands that West Ham remain reluctant to sanction an exit for Scamacca, despite his willingness to return to Italy, and will stand their ground until they identify potential replacements. AC Milan and Atalanta are also interested in Scamacca, who earned his move to West Ham after scoring 16 goals for Sassuolo in an impressive 2021/22 season."
Bayer Leverkusen confirm signing of Granit Xhaka from Arsenal,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayer-leverkusen-confirm-signing-of-granit-xhaka-from-arsenal,"Bayer Leverkusen have confirmed the signing of midfielder Granit Xhaka from Arsenal on a five-year deal.  The midfielder enjoyed a career best year at Arsenal during the 2022/23 campaign, helping the Gunners to a second place finish in his seventh and final season at the Emirates Stadium.  90min understands that Leverkusen put together a package totalling â¬25m to sign the 30-year-old this summer.  Speaking to the club's official website after making the move, Xhaka said: ""I know the league inside out and I watched it when I was in London. Bayer 04 is a club with an impressive history and ambitious targets. ""Above all, I see it as a club with a great future. Discussions with the management have been incredibly motivating. Everybody here is ambitious and wants to achieve something â I'm very much looking forward to the next few years."" The club's sporting managing director Simon Rolfes also expressed his delight at the signing, saying: ""In Granit we have been able to bring in an absolute top player.""His ability on the pitch is well known. But, above all, there are few players who are able to so convincingly lead a team like he does thanks to his outstanding mentality and personality,"" The news comes ahead of Arsenal's British record-breaking move for Declan Rice nears completion. Arsenal have agreed a Â£100m plus Â£5m in add-ons fee in order to sign the England international from West Ham United this summer, with a medical scheduled to be completed on Friday. "
Chelsea continue Christian Pulisic exit talks with AC Milan; Rayan Cherki & Gabri Veiga on shortlist,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-continue-christian-pulisic-exit-talks-ac-milan-rayan-cherki-gabri-veiga,"Chelsea remain locked in talks with AC Milan over the sale of winger Christian Pulisic, 90min understands. Pulisic has received proposals from both Milan and French side Lyon but is prioritising a move to the Rossoneri and is now believed to have reached a full agreement over personal terms with Milan, even accepting a reduction on his current wage to try and push the move through. Chelsea are keen to part ways with Pulisic and are now looking for a fee of around Â£20m, having lowered their asking price in search of a compromise with Milan.  The Rossoneri have also increased their initial proposal after Lyon lodged a superior bid but, as 90min reported at the time, Pulisic's preference is to move to Milan and everyone involved is now looking to get an agreement over the line. While talks with Lyon may not lead to a deal for Pulisic, Chelsea did use the occasion to voice their interest in 19-year-old midfielder Rayan Cherki, who 90min understands has long been followed by those in charge at Stamford Bridge. feed Elsewhere, Chelsea continue to look at their midfield options. Brighton's Moises Caicedo is a top priority and 90min understands a bid for the Ecuador international is being prepared, but there are plans to add another new face in that area of the pitch as well. Celta Vigo's Gabri Veiga is of interest to the Blues but there is significant competition for the Spain Under-21 international, who is admired by PSG, Manchester City, Liverpool and Newcastle, among others. A decision is not expected to be made until towards the end of pre-season, however, with new manager Mauricio Pochettino keen to see whether any of the current crop of young midfielders at the club are ready to make an immediate impact. Brazilian Andrey Santos is attracting significant loan interest from across Europe but is expected to be given the chance to impress in pre-season, while decisions will have to be made on Carney Chukwuemeka and Cesare Casadei. Casadei, whose only senior football came in a six-month loan spell with Reading last season, is likely to be sent on a top-flight loan move this time around."
Dusan Vlahovic increasingly likely to leave Juventus,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/dusan-vlahovic-increasingly-likely-leave-juventus,"Dusan Vlahovic is increasingly likely to leave Juventus this summer, with the club drawing up a list of replacements for the striker, 90min understands.  Vlahovic has been heavily linked with a move away from La Vecchia Signora in recent months, and Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Chelsea all retain an interest in the Serbian striker's services. 90min reported in May that the Red Devils see Vlahovic as a 'first box' striker option this summer alongside Harry Kane, Victor Osimhen and Lautaro Martinez, while Chelsea see the player as a viable alternative to Osimhen if a move for the Napoli striker fails to materialise.  Sources confirmed to 90min at the start of June that Vlahovic had requested to leave the club this summer, and it is understood that manager Max Allegri has given his blessing to sanction the player's move. In order to sell the Serbian, Juve are keen to recoup the â¬70m they spent on him back in January 2022 when he turned down the opportunity to sign for Arsenal in favour of a move to the Allianz Stadium.  With Vlahovic increasingly likely to leave, Juventus are now looking a potential replacements for the 23-year-old.  La Vecchia Signora have spoken to representatives of both Rasmus Hojlund and Jonathan David thus far, although the price tags placed on both players could be a deterrent for any move.  Hojlund enjoyed a breakthrough season with Atalanta in 2022/23, scoring 10 goals in all competitions and becoming one of the most sought-after young strikers in Europe, while David scored a career-high 24 Ligue 1 goals with LOSC Lille.  feed Another Juve star who has been heavily linked with a move away from Turin this summer is Federico Chiesa. The wide player featured sporadically since returning from a lengthy injury lay-off, making just six Serie A starts during the 2022/23 season.  90min understands that, as things stand, the player is more likely than Vlahovic to remain at Juventus however his future ultimately depends on how much interest emerges for his services.  Sources have stated that Juve are currently drawing up a list of potential replacements for the winger if he does leave. "
Inter tell Man Utd to raise Andre Onana offer despite receiving improved bid,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/inter-man-utd-raise-andre-onana-offer-improved-bid,"Inter have told Manchester United they must raise their offer for Andre Onana, sources have confirmed to 90min, after the Red Devils made a second bid for the goalkeeper worth â¬50m (Â£43m). The Italian giants had already rejected one approach from United worth a total of â¬45m (Â£38.5m), but talks have continued between the two parties. United returned to the negotiating table with a second offer, this time worth â¬45m in guaranteed money plus â¬5m in add-ons, but Inter have made it clear that the 13-time Premier League winners must come closer to their â¬60m (Â£51m) valuation. Sources indicate that the two clubs may end up meeting between the two amounts in order to close a deal, with Inter's precarious financial situation meaning they must sell players before reinvesting in their squad. Onana has been established by Erik ten Hag as his top goalkeeping target after United withdrew a contract offer to last season's first choice, David de Gea - the Spaniard is technically a free agent now that his previous deal has expired. It's expected United will speak to De Gea about his long-term plan but Ten Hag has decided it's important to upgrade in the position this summer if the club can attract the right player for the right price. feed Interest from Saudi Arabia has already been rebuffed by Onana, with the Cameroon international instead keen to reunite with Ten Hag, who was his manager for five years at Ajax. Inter need to raise money to balance their books and recently sold high-earner Marcelo Brozovic to Al Nassr. Davide Frattesi has already replaced him in midfield, but Inter also have ambitions to bring Romelu Lukaku back to San Siro after a loan spell last year. United completed the signing of Mason Mount from Chelsea on Wednesday, in a deal worth up to Â£60m if all add-ons are met, and are keen to add a centre forward to their squad. Atalanta striker Rasmus Hojlund is emerging as one of their key striking targets, with higher value targets such as Harry Kane and Victor Osimhen looking difficult to attain."
Where Dominik Szoboszlai ranks in Liverpool's most expensive transfers,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/where-dominik-szoboszlai-ranks-liverpool-most-expensive-transfers,"We were always going to see an aggressive Liverpool emerge in the summer transfer window following the disappointment of 2022/23. Midfield was regarded as the key problem area the club needed to solve and many believe the Reds have already mitigated such woes with the arrivals of Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai. While the club's purchase of World Cup winner Mac Allister may go down as the bargain of the summer, the Reds were forced to pay more to sign Szoboszlai and the Hungarian playmaker is now one of the most expensive signings in Liverpool's history. DS8ï¸â£ pic.twitter.com/qR1sbT8D4d This is a transfer that's been years in the making, but the actual move was quite sudden. Heading into the summer transfer window, Newcastle appeared the most likely destination for Szoboszlai, although Liverpool had registered an interest and they were given a free run at Hungary's captain after the Magpies opted to pursue Sandro Tonali. With Szoboszlai keen to work under Jurgen Klopp, personal terms were never going to be an issue, but this was still a pretty complicated deal to pull off with Liverpool needing to trigger the player's â¬70m release clause by the end of June. RB Leipzig also wanted the majority of this fee paid up front. feed Deemed as a necessity by the Reds boss, however, Liverpool went through with the deal with Fenway Sports Group giving the financial green light. While new sporting director Jorg Schmadtke proved key in smoothing out the major details of the deal, this is a move said to be driven by Klopp, who has tracked Szoboszlai's progress since he faced up against the Reds for RB Salzburg during the 2019/20 Champions League group stages. Rank Player Joined from Fee 1. Darwin Nunez Benfica Â£85.4m 2. Virgil van Dijk Southampton Â£75m 3. Alisson AS Roma Â£65m 4. Dominik Szoboszlai RB Leipzig Â£60.1m 5. Naby Keita RB Leipzig Â£52.75m 6. Luis Diaz Porto Â£50m 7. Diogo Jota Wolves Â£45m 8. Cody Gakpo PSV Â£44m 9. Fabinho  AS Monaco Â£43.7m 10. Mohamed Salah AS Roma Â£43m While several members of the Premier League's big six have struggled when it comes to big-money arrivals, Liverpool have hit the nail on the head more often than not. Out of their ten most expensive arrivals, only Naby Keita was a distinct failure. The midfielder departed the club this summer on a free transfer after five indifferent years at Anfield. While the jury's still out on Darwin Nunez and Cody Gakpo is only a few months into his Liverpool career, the rest have  been brilliant for the Reds. The club smartly used the funds garnered from Philippe Coutinho's monster sale to sign Virgil van Dijk and Alisson, with both playing crucial roles in Liverpool's rise under Klopp. Coming in below Keita is Luis Diaz, who enjoyed a scintillating opening six months on Merseyside before suffering a long-term injury during his second season. Diogo Jota, meanwhile, has been an incredibly handy option for Klopp since joining from Wolves for Â£45m. Rounding off the top ten is Fabinho, another crucial cog in Liverpool's transformation, and Mohamed Salah, a truly great contemporary Red who has scored the joint-fifth highest number of goals in the club's history. Liverpool's track record would suggest it's more likely than not that Szoboszlai, who has become the club's fourth most expensive signing ever, will blossom into a star at Anfield."
Cesar Azpilicueta leaves Chelsea for Atletico Madrid,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/cesar-azpilicueta-leaves-chelsea-atletico-madrid,"Cesar Azpilicueta has completed his move from Chelsea to Atletico Madrid on a free transfer. The Spaniard had agreed personal terms with Inter and was expected to seal a switch to Serie A before Atletico made a late bid and quickly established themselves as the favourites to get a deal done. Despite still having one year remaining on his contract, Chelsea agreed to grant Azpilicueta a free transfer as a mark of respect to their captain, whose 11-year spell at Stamford Bridge has now come to a close. Before sealing his move, Azpilicueta posted a lengthy farewell message to Chelsea fans, vowing to return to Stamford Bridge in the future. feed Azpilicueta leaves Chelsea having won every major trophy available to him: the Champions League, Europa League, Club World Cup, Super Cup, Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup. The versatile defender, who is primarily a right-back but has performed at a high level both on the left and in the centre, racked up an enormous 508 appearances for Chelsea, chipping in with 17 goals and a respectable 56 assists. He sits sixth on Chelsea's all-time appearances list and played more games for the Blues than any overseas player in their history, 14 ahead of Czech goalkeeper Petr Cech. Azpilicueta now returns to La Liga for the first time since 2010, when he initially left Osasuna for Marseille. He sits on 99 appearances in the division and will hit his century when he makes his debut for Atletico."
Real Madrid confirm Arda Guler signing after winger officially joins PSG,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/real-madrid-arda-guler-signing-winger-joins-psg,"Real Madrid have confirmed the signing of Turkish sensation Arda Guler from Fenerbahce, just an hour after Paris Saint-Germain confirmed the arrival of winger Marco Asensio. The 18-year-old was one of the most in-demand players around when his â¬17.5m release clause became active and both Real Madrid and Barcelona lodged bids to try and lure Guler away. Guler ultimately chose Real Madrid, whose offer of â¬20m is above Guler's release clause but, importantly, can be paid in instalments. ""Real Madrid CF and FenerbahÃ§e SK have agreed on the transfer of the player Arda Guler, who will be linked to our club for the next six seasons,"" a brief statement read, before confirming his presentation to the media on Friday. Guler, who has four senior caps for Turkey to his name, leaves Fenerbahce after notching 21 goal contributions in 51 appearances, comprised of nine goals and 12 assists. feed Primarily an attacking midfielder, Guler has spent plenty of time out on the wing and will likely help fill the void left behind by the departures of Eden Hazard and Marco Asensio - the latter of whom has been confirmed as PSG's latest signing. Asensio has signed a three-year contract in the French capital after spending eight years at Real Madrid. He won three La Liga titles, three Champions League crowns, four Club World Cups, three UEFA Super Cups, two Spanish Super Cups and last season's Copa del Rey in that time, and is a mainstay in the Spanish national team. To compensate for his departure, Braham Diaz has returned to Real, extending his contract to join Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo in Real Madrid's attacking line. There are still plans to sign a new striker following the departure of Karim Benzema, with PSG's Kylian Mbappe their top target and Tottenham's Harry Kane an option."
Barcelona transfers: Positions La Blaugrana must strengthen before summer deadline,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-transfers-positions-strengthen-before-summer-deadline,"Joan Laporta's lever-pulling did just about enough to ensure Barcelona could stay afloat and remain competitive in 2022/23. While La Blaugrana again failed miserably in Europe, their stellar domestic form culminated in La Liga glory - their first league title since 2018/19. Despite this success, financial turmoil still envelops the great Catalan club and will vastly restrict the business they can conduct this summer. However, the exits of stalwarts leaves Xavi with multiple holes to fill and BarÃ§a's shrewdness in the market is set to be put to the test given their monetary limitations. Here are three positions Barcelona must look to strengthen before the summer window slams shut. Xavi has a bit of a predicament at right back because his two best performers at the position are centre-backs by trade and one, Jules Kounde, doesn't view his long-term future out on the flank.  Both Kounde and Ronald Araujo performed well at right-back last season when called upon but La Blaugrana are expected to be in the market for another option to appease Kounde. Although, the Frenchman might find it difficult to displace either Araujo or Andreas Christensen at the heart of BarÃ§a's defence. Nevertheless, the club has a long standing interest in former Tottenham defender Juan Foyth, currently at Villarreal, while coveted Real Valladolid full back Ivan Fresneda has also been linked with a move to Catalonia. Joao Cancelo was once talked up as a possibility, but the finances involved render that deal tough to pull off. Fresneda appears to be the number one option at this stage and while he may not usurp Kounde right away, he's got the potential to emerge as a dynamic full back star under Xavi. There's a vast Sergio Busquets-shaped hole that needs to be filled in the dressing room. Barcelona astutely signed treble hero Ilkay Gundogan on a free transfer to get their summer transfer window underway, but Xavi is likely to view the German as a midfielder who'll do greater damage between the lines and closer to the opposition box. Frenkie de Jong's success in a box-to-box role means he's unlikely to be moulded into a single pivot midfielder, while Gavi and Pedri are both better suited to more advanced roles.  BarÃ§a need a bona fide holding midfielder to replace Busquets and they were rumoured to be in for Real Sociedad metronome Martin Zubimendi heading into the summer window. Interest on that front, however, appears to have cooled and former Southampton man Oriol Romeu is now the club's top target after a fine season with Girona. feed The club's purchase of Brazilian sensation Vitor Roque should solve their post-Robert Lewandowski striker issue and Xavi is blessed with several options to deploy down the right flank. On the left, however, the situation is murkier. Ansu Fati looked set to be La Blaugrana's next superstar when he burst onto the scene as a teenager, but injuries have prevented the Spaniard's career from taking off. His future looked to be in doubt this summer, but a promising end to the season should convince the club to retain his services and the 20-year-old could make the left wing spot his own next season should he stay fit. However, Xavi's lack of options last season led to the deployment of an extra midfielder down the left in a bid to establish greater control in central areas. The BarÃ§a boss may continue with this ploy next season, but La Blaugrana are undoubtedly more dynamic with a player of Fati's profile in the side.  If Ferran Torres departs, the club should seek to sign a replacement who could compete with Fati for minutes down the left. "
Man City transfers: Positions the Cityzens must strengthen before summer deadline,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-city-transfers-positions-strengthen-before-summer-deadline,"Pep Guardiola has the unenviable task of trying to improve on near perfection. His Manchester City side won the Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup last term and the Spaniard will have his eye on replicating his team's success next season. Based on the evidence of last season, there is very little City need to do in the transfer market. More of the same will be the message from Guardiola, who clinched his 12th major trophy at the Etihad with the club's European success.  However, if you stand still in football you will be sorely punished and City have already made moves in the transfer window this summer. Mateo Kovacic has replaced the departing Ilkay Gundogan, while a deal for RB Leipzig's Josko Gvardiol edges closer to completion. That's a good start for the Sky Blues but let's have a look at where else Guardiola can strengthen his side this summer. With Kyle Walker's contract expiring in just under a year's time and Joao Cancelo seemingly heading out the Etihad exit door, Guardiola could be short on the right-hand side of his defence. If both were to leave, Rico Lewis would be the coach's only option. While City are keen to extend Walker's deal amid interest from Bayern Munich and will likely receive a hefty fee for Cancelo, the European champions will be keen not to leave their dealings too late in the window. Lewis may be a fantastic young talent, but he isn't ready to be starting 50+ games a season for the Cityzens. One man linked with Manchester is Paris Saint-Germain's Achraf Hakimi. A sensationally gifted and attack-minded right back, the 24-year-old would undoubtedly be a great addition to City's ranks, although a transfer would be difficult to pull off due to the Moroccan's high price tag. One of the worst kept secrets in recent transfer windows has been Guardiola's admiration for Leipzig defender Gvardiol. The 21-year-old's meteoric rise to Bundesliga stardom has thrust him into the dazzling spotlight of the transfer merry-go-round and he now seems set for a big-money move to the Premier League champions. The left-footed centre back would command an eye-watering fee, with Leipzig wanting a nine-digit sum for their starlet. Guardiola is never shy of splashing the cash for the right player and given the Croatian defender's age, technical prowess and physicality, he's a no-brainer signing for any club that can afford him. While City appear well-stocked in the centre of defence, Gvardiol's ability to cover Nathan Ake's role as a left-back/centre-back depending on the occasion makes him a desirable asset. Team this with Aymeric Laporte's likely exit in search of more regular minutes and it's obvious why Guardiola is so keen to bring the phenom to Manchester. When Guardiola needs someone to rely on in the big games, he always calls on Bernardo Silva.  This was epitomised in the second leg of the club's Champions League semi-final with Real Madrid last season, with the 28-year-old rewarding his manager's faith with two goals and a stunning all-round performance in a 4-0 victory. However, his time at City may be coming to an end as PSG, Barcelona and clubs in Saudi Arabia attempt to lure him away from the Etihad. While not a traditional central midfielder, often featuring in an attacking role or on the left flank, Silva is more productive in central areas and his versatility has proved crucial to Guardiola.   If the Portugal international is to leave, City will need someone to fill his boots. That, of course, could be Phil Foden who is expected to play in a more central role moving forward, but that would leave Guardiola needing cover on the left wing. Guardiola could call on his compatriot Gabri Veiga to help strengthen City in Silva's absence. The Sky Blues hold an interest in the 21-year-old who enjoyed a sensational season at Celta Vigo last year and a Â£34m release clause makes him an affordable prospect. At that kind of price, Veiga could be one of the value-for-money picks of the summer. feed It is hard to believe Riyad Mahrez will turn 33 in February. The Algerian has never relied on pace, instead using his light frame and excellent close control to punish opponents, chopping in on his favoured left foot and unleashing all the quality he possesses with one stroke. However, the winger's influence is just slightly starting to wane. Less assured of a starting berth, his minutes are naturally being more closely managed due to his advancing age. Mahrez has been linked with a move to Saudi Arabia this summer - albeit like most players - but even if the attacker stays on at the Etihad, City should still be lining up his successor. This becomes even more significant if Silva were to depart as well, leaving the Cityzens short on the right-hand side. A right-sided player who favours his left foot would be required, but there are no reports linking City with an extra forward yet this window. That could all change, however, as the new Premier League season edges closer."
Newcastle holding talks with Leicester over West Ham target Harvey Barnes,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/newcastle-talks-leicester-west-ham-target-harvey-barnes,"Newcastle United are in talks with Leicester City over a deal for Harvey Barnes, who is one of West Ham United's primary transfer targets. The 25-year-old scored 13 Premier League goals last season but was unable to prevent Leicester City from dropping into the Championship, just seven years after they shocked the world to lift the title. 90min recently revealed that West Ham were advancing talks with Leicester over Barnes, as David Moyes looks to bolster the quality of his attack. The Scot currently has Said Benrahma, Pablo Fornals and Maxwel Cornet as his options on the left hand side, but is open to moving players on this summer in a bid to freshen things up at London Stadium. Newcastle have a long-standing interest in Barnes, who has been capped once by England, and are willing to move on Allan Saint-Maximin this summer - 90min first reported interest in his services from a number of Saudi Pro League clubs. They have already completed the signing of Sandro Tonali from AC Milan, in a deal worth as much as Â£60m, and are looking to increase the quality of their squad ahead of a return to Champions League competition. feed 90min understands that Newcastle have opened talks with Leicester over a deal for Barnes, with West Ham also continuing to negotiate with the 2021 FA Cup winners. The Foxes have already lost James Maddison to Tottenham Hotspur this summer and are resigned to losing more of their leading players after dropping into the second tier. Aston Villa are also keeping a firm eye on developments with Barnes, having secured their own route back into European competition under Unai Emery. The Villans finished seventh in the Premier League last season, a remarkable turnaround after sacking Steven Gerrard last October. West Ham can also offer Barnes continental football, securing their place in next season's Europa League after beating Fiorentina 2-1 in the Conference League final to win a first trophy in 43 years."
Cesar Azpilicueta undergoes Atletico Madrid medical ahead of Chelsea exit,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/cesar-azpilicueta-atletico-madrid-medical-chelsea,"Cesar Azpilicueta is in Madrid to put the finishing touches on his move to Atletico Madrid, 90min understands. The veteran defender had been expected to join Inter after agreeing a contract with the Serie A side, but Atletico made a late swoop to lure Azpilicueta back to Spain and quickly convinced him to head to the Wanda Metropolitano instead. A two-year contract is on the table for Azpilicueta, who is in Madrid for medical tests ahead of sealing his exit from Chelsea. Chelsea have granted Azpilicueta a free transfer away from Stamford Bridge as a show of respect to the 33-year-old, who joined in 2012 and has made more appearances for the club than any other overseas player. feed Azpilicueta came close to a return to Spain last year when Barcelona came calling, but the defender instead opted to stay at Chelsea to help steer the Blues through their transition to the BlueCo ownership era. However, with game time now hard to come by for the 33-year-old, Azpilicueta will now be allowed to leave the club and he has chosen Atletico for his new home. Chelsea are already prepared for his departure, bringing in right-back Malo Gusto from Lyon in January, while the returning Levi Colwill will also ensure the Blues are not caught out at centre-back either. Azpilicueta will leave Chelsea with 508 appearances to his name, putting him sixth on the club's all-time appearance charts, and a trophy cabinet full of nine pieces of silverware."
Mason Mount reveals key reason for leaving Chelsea,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/mason-mount-reveals-key-reason-for-leaving-chelsea,"Mason Mount says it ""became clear"" that he was not going to be included in Chelsea's long-term plans. The 24-year-old's 18-year association with the Blues ended on Wednesday as his move to Manchester United, which would eventually be worth Â£60m, was made official. Chelsea had been involved in lengthy contract negotiations with Mount over a new deal, but ultimately the two parties were unable to agree terms on extending his Stamford Bridge stay. Instead, a move to Manchester United came over the horizon, with a deal eventually struck between the Premier League heavyweights at the fourth time of asking. Mount has taken plenty of stick on social media for abandoning Chelsea, but his first interview with his new club has revealed his belief that his time in west London was up. ""Several months ago, it became clear that I wasn't in Chelsea's plans moving forward,"" Mount told United's official website. ""Once I knew that United were involved, my decision was made up. A massive club, huge iconic players have played here, and I wanted to be a part of that from the beginning. Getting in early and ready for pre-season to start was a main objective of mine as well. feed ""The most important thing for me was getting there, being ready on day one and being able to obviously meet all the players, the manager, and get working."" Mount enjoyed a swift rise to prominence after successful loan spells at Vitesse Arnhem and Derby County. He signed a new five-year contract at Chelsea in July 2019 and quickly became a first-team regular under Frank Lampard, who had overseen his loan spell at Pride Park. He also became a regular starter for Gareth Southgate's England, playing a prominent role in the Three Lions' run through to the Euro 2020 final. Four full seasons at Chelsea yielded 195 appearances in all competitions for Mount, with 33 goals scored in that time. But 2022/23 was a real struggle for the Portsmouth-born midfielder, as he contended with various injuries and a noticeable loss of form."
Chelsea beat Man City & Tottenham to signing of Everton teenager Ishe Samuels-Smith,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-beat-man-city-tottenham-to-signing-ishe-samuels-smith,"Chelsea have struck a deal to sign 17-year-old Everton defender Ishe Samuels-Smith, 90min understands. The young left-back, who is also comfortable in the centre of defence, was a regular feature for Everton's Under-21 side last season and sat on the first-team bench in both the Premier League and Carabao Cup last season. Chelsea attempted to sign Samuels-Smith last summer but failed to get an agreement over the line, but their interest never disappeared and sources have now confirmed to 90min that a deal has been struck with Everton to sign the talented teenager. The Blues have beaten a number of Premier League clubs to his signature, fending off competition from Manchester City, Newcastle and Tottenham to secure Samuels-Smith on a three-year contract - the maximum length for players of his agen feed Born in Manchester, towering left-back Samuels-Smith has long been touted as a potential star of the future.  Both Frank Lampard and Sean Dyche involved the 17-year-old with the Everton first team, and although he failed to make an appearance under either, his inclusion on the bench under two managers serves as an indication of his impact behind the scenes. At international level, Samuels-Smith has represented England up to the Under-17s and was the only member of the Young Lions to feature in the Team of the Tournament at this summer's European Under-17 Championships, where he impressed as an outside centre-back. Left-back has been a problem area for the Chelsea academy for the past few years, with the Blues regularly dipping their toes into the transfer market to try and add depth. 19-year-old Zak Sturge joined from Brighton last summer but ended this past season playing centrally alongside Dylan Williams, who was signed from Derby in January 2022 and made it onto the bench under Thomas Tuchel during an FA Cup victory over Luton Town shortly after his arrival."
Real Madrid or Barcelona: Arda Guler's father suggests decision is made,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/real-madrid-or-barcelona-arda-guler-father-decision,"Arda Guler's father has seemingly confirmed in a post on WhatsApp that his son will turn down the advances of Barcelona in order to join Real Madrid this summer. The talented 18-year-old has emerged as a major target for both clubs after putting in some hugely promising performances for Fenerbahce. 90min reported on Wednesday that both Barcelona and Real had made offers to land the teenager, with their bids - understood to be around the â¬20m mark - exceeding the release clause written into his contract so it can be paid in instalments. Realare confident of winning the race to sign Guler, believing that chief scout Juni Calafat has done enough to convince him that his future lies in the Spanish capital - he also played a similar role in Jude Bellingham's move from Borussia Dortmund earlier this summer. feed And that confidence appears to have been echoed by Guler's father, Umit, after he posted a clip on WhatsApp of a scene from a Turkish television show. ""Let's go on vacation to Barcelona,"" a woman says in the scene posted, to which her husband responds ""No way I will go to Barcelona. I will only go to Real Madrid"".  Guler has been one of the most talked about young midfielders in Europe ever since he broke through into Fenerbahce's first team in August 2021. He became the youngest goalscorer in the club's Super Lig history soon after, with his displays thereafter earning him the coveted number ten shirt. Should the move to Madrid go through as expected, Guler will join an exciting pool of young players expected to reach the top of the game. Bellingham, Aurelien Tchouameni and Eduardo Camavinga are all committed to the club long-term, while Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo look likely to command starting roles up front for many years to come."
Milan Skriniar confirms new club after Inter exit,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/milan-skriniar-confirms-new-club-after-inter-exit,"Paris Saint-Germain have confirmed the signing of defender Milan Skriniar on a five-year contract following his exit from Inter. The Slovakia international established himself as one of the best centre backs in Europe during his six-year stint with Inter as he won a Serie A title, two Coppas Italia and finished as a runner up in both the Europa League and Champions League. Inter confirmed Skriniar's departure last Friday, thanking the 28-year-old for his role in their ""extraordinary growth path"" which includes five trophies in the last three seasons. Skriniar said: ""I am very happy to be part of this wonderful club. PSG is one of the best clubs in the world, with world class players and fantastic fans."" feed His arrival will boost PSG's defensive options following the departure of Sergio Ramos on a free transfer. An injury to Presnel Kimpembe limited their options at the back last season and Skriniar will provide competition for the Frenchman alongside club captain Marquinhos. Luis Enrique has been confirmed as Christophe Galtier's replacement at Parc des Princes in his first job since leaving the Spain role following their 2022 World Cup campaign. Stefan de Vrij remains a key part of the Nerazzurri team while Alessandro Bastoni has just signed a new contract to remain at San Siro until 2028. Francesco Acerbi also started alongside Matteo Darmian in Inter's back three during the Champions League final defeat to Manchester City."
Most expensive English midfielders ever,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/most-expensive-english-midfielders,"There was once a time when England produced a profile of midfielder that was a source of envy across the globe. In Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, and Paul Scholes, England boasted three of the leading midfielders of their generation. However, the trio rarely succeeded together for the national team and their similar brilliance has since triggered tedious debates over who was superior years after their respective retirements.  It's fair to say England endured a lean spell of producing elite midfield talent in the years succeeding the aforementioned era, but the supreme English box-to-boxers are on the rise again, folks. While Gerrard, Lampard and Scholes stayed wedded to one club for much or the entirety of their careers, the new generation have already racked up mammoth transfer fees.  Here are the ten most expensive English midfielders of all time. Willock completed a permanent transfer to Newcastle off the back of a sensational loan spell during which he scored in seven consecutive games to conclude the 2020/21 campaign.His first season after completing a permanent move was disappointing, but Eddie Howe's arrival offered Willock a new lease of life and he was instrumental in an enterprising box-to-box role for the Magpies last season as they secured a top-four finish.Willock scored three times and added six assists. Now, those bright Champions League lights await. You all laughed at Birmingham, didn't you? However, the club's decision to retire Bellingham's number 22 shirt has certainly been vindicated given the player he's quickly become.Birmingham parted ways with one of their own for a club-record fee, with Borussia Dortmund, revered for their relationship with blossoming young stars, snapping the precocious 17-year-old up for Â£25m.The German club would go on to make quite a tidy profit from his future sale. This signing arrived at a time when Southampton appeared to be no more than a mere feeder club to Liverpool.Lallana was the spiritual hub of the Saints during their return to the Premier League and subsequent stay in the top flight before he made the move to the Reds in 2014.While he never developed into a superstar at Anfield, Lallana ended his Liverpool career having made 178 appearances for the club. Much of his best work on Merseyside arrived before the Reds developed into a juggernaut under Jurgen Klopp. Oxlade-Chamberlain took a more indirect route from Southampton to Liverpool as he enjoyed a six-year stay at Arsenal in between. The Reds paid a sizeable fee for a player deemed disposable by the Gunners at the time, but the versatile midfielder quickly quashed any naysayers by embarking on a stellar debut season at Anfield.However, the rest of Oxlade-Chamberlain's time at Liverpool was hampered by injuries. He missed almost the whole 2018/19 season and, after a playing a bit-part role in the club's Premier League triumph, the midfielder's minutes dwindled before his contract expired in 2023.  After playing a supporting role in Leicester's miracle of 2015/16, Drinkwater moved to Chelsea as part of what became an infamous transfer window for the Blues.Their work in the market in 2016 catapulted them to the title under Antonio Conte, but their 2017 summer window was nothing short of disastrous. Drinkwater was one of several big-money acquisitions that flopped hard at Stamford Bridge. The midfielder, who struggled with injuries, made just 23 appearances for the Blues in five years before leaving on a free transfer in 2022. The first major acquisition of the Ange Postecoglou (apologies, Guglielmo Vicario) era looks to be a bargain. Leicester were once demanding close to Â£80m for the services of Maddison, but the Foxes' relegation to the second tier gave them little leverage when negotiating with interested parties. Tottenham moved quickly to secure their man, who they've liked since his Coventry days, with many supporters labelling Maddison as the club's Christian Eriksen replacement three years in the making. Phillips forged quite the reputation during his time under Marcelo Bielsa at Leeds and he cemented himself as a regular for England at Euro 2020. He'd later be named as the Three Lions' player of the year in 2021.The midfielder's rise culminated in a Â£42m move to Manchester City in 2022, but Phillips is yet to make a name for himself at the Etihad. The 'Yorkshire Pirlo' barely featured as the Citizens claimed a historic treble during his debut season. This was a move that raised plenty of eyebrows. During their summer influx of transfers ahead of their return campaign in the Premier League, Nottingham Forest splashed the cash to acquire the services of talented Wolves youngster Gibbs-White. While the creative midfielder had flashed his talent at Molineux, there was little to suggest he was worth such an extortionate fee.Nevertheless, Gibbs-White proved many wrong in his debut season at the City Ground as he played a starring role in Forest's survival. Bellingham was only briefly the most expensive English midfielder ever after he completed an initial Â£88m move to Real Madrid. The midfielder developed into a superstar at Dortmund and came ever so close to spearheading a title victory in what would prove to be his last at the club.Bellingham's three years in the Ruhr were littered with majesty as he blossomed into one of Europe's leading midfielders. He's bound to shine for both club and country for the next decade. "

Chelsea preparing to make opening offer to Brighton for Moises Caicedo,"Jul 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-preparing-opening-offer-brighton-moises-caicedo,"Chelsea are preparing to make an opening offer to Brighton and Hove Albion to sign Moises Caicedo, 90min understands. The Ecuadorian midfielder has emerged as Chelsea's top midfield target this summer, and talks have already taken place with the player's camp. Personal terms are not seen as an issue from either side, with the player hopeful of the move, but Chelsea are yet to engage fully with Brighton over terms of a potential deal. Caicedo, who signed a new long-term contract in March after seeing a January move to Arsenal fail to materialise, has made it clear to Brighton that he would like the chance to move on before the new season begins.  The club are open to the prospect of allowing Caicedo to leave - but are determined to achieve what they feel is a fair price for the 21-year-old. Brighton have seen Premier League rivals West Ham agree a British record Â£105m fee with Arsenal for Declan Rice, and sources indicate the club feel Caicedo's fee should be in the same ""ball park"". They are currently holding out for Â£100m and have indicated to the player's camp that they will only sell for a price they deem fair market value. Chelsea, for their part, have done their homework on Caicedo and feel he will be the perfect addition to their midfield - and especially crucial given they have lost the experienced Mason Mount, Mateo Kovacic, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and N'Golo Kante from their midfield so far this summer. feed Caicedo is desired by Chelsea to be a part of their midfield overhaul and 90min understands that even if this deal is finalised, that the Blues could look for more additions in the middle of the pitch. Southampton's Romeo Lavia remains under consideration. The Southampton midfielder is set to be at the centre of a Premier League tug-of-war however, with Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle all showing interest in the player themselves to varying degrees. One new midfielder who has arrived at Chelsea is Andrey Santos. Santos signed in January from Vasco Da Gama, but at that time didn't qualify for a work permit to play in England. The 19-year-old returned to his former club on loan as a result, and has since become a full Brazilian international - he is now eligible to play in the Premier League and has started pre-season training with the Blues. 90min understands that a host of clubs have contacted Chelsea to ask about taking the young international midfielder on loan for the coming season. Portuguese giants Porto have enquired, as have domestic rivals Sporting CP. Both Milan clubs have also expressed an interest in Santos' situation, while there are clubs interested from Germany and France. However, Chelsea sources have told 90min that as it stands new head coach Mauricio Pochettino wants to asses Santos over pre-season. Chelsea have been hugely impressed with Santos' progress in the last six months and feel he could yet feature and contribute in the Premier League."
Arsenal transfers: Positions the Gunners must strengthen before summer deadline,"Jul 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-transfers-positions-strengthen-before-summer-deadline,"We're entering year four of Mikel Arteta's project and the Arsenal hierarchy are intent on the club continuing its ascent under the Spanish boss. The Gunners took an exponential leap in 2022/23 and came somewhat close to lifting their first Premier League title since the Invincibles campaign of 2003/04. A stuttering epilogue meant Manchester City eventually strolled to their third straight crown, but Arteta is determined to knock the Cityzens off their perch next season. Arsenal have been mightily aggressive in the summer window so far. After signing Kai Havertz to a monster pay packet, the club fought off several members of Europe's elite to bring Declan Rice to north London in a British record deal. These two additions, even if Granit Xhaka and Thomas Partey depart, leaves Arsenal's midfield in a distinct position of strength and Jurrien Timber, who's soon expected to join, will supply greater depth in multiple defensive roles. The Gunners are well on their way to building a squad capable of competing with City at the Premier League summit, but there are still a couple of positions that could do with strengthening this summer. Bukayo Saka has established himself as one of the world's best wingers and played a pivotal role in Arsenal's excellent 2022/23 campaign. However, the club's starboy, who appeared in every Premier League game last term, burned out down the stretch for the second season running. Arteta simply didn't trust Saka's deputies, although his options were slim. Reiss Nelson is better off the left, as is Leandro Trossard. There isn't a player in the Arsenal squad that comes close to replicating what Saka does down the right. However, with Arsenal returning to the Champions League next season, Arteta can ill-afford to use Saka as frequently as he has done since succeeding Unai Emery as manager. The poor kid is going to need some respite, but the club must sign somebody the manager trusts to perform the isolated right-winger role to a high enough standard so they can rotate with Saka. Admittedly, signing a player of such quality who'd be happy to play second fiddle will not be easy. Perhaps Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz should see more minutes on the right next season. feed The impending arrival of Timber is such a shrewd one as he can provide cover at right-back, centre-back, left-back, and holding midfield. He's another unicorn talent. Oleksandr Zinchenko is the undisputed number one choice left-back heading into 2023/24 and Arsenal are not going to find an upgrade on the Ukrainian. However, both Kieran Tierney and Nuno Tavares could be on the move this summer which may force Arsenal to dip their toe into the left-back market. While Timber and Takehiro Tomiyasu are capable of performing the inverted role from the opposite flank, signing a full-back with an alternate profile might be wise. If Tierney remains in north London, then there's no need to invest at this position."

Inter reject opening offer worth â¬45m from Man Utd for Andre Onana,"Jul 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/inter-reject-opening-offer-45m-man-utd-andre-onana,"Inter have rejected an opening offer from Manchester United for goalkeeper Andre Onana, 90min understands. United have identified Onana as their top goalkeeping target and are hoping to strike a deal for the Cameroon international, though are keen not to exceed their valuation of the player. Talks between the two clubs continue and there is optimism a deal can be thrashed out. The offer from United is understood to be worth a total of â¬40m plus â¬5m add-ons, though Inter have turned down the approach. Their valuation for Onana, who impressed with his performances at the end of last season - notably in the Champions League final against Manchester City - is â¬60m (Â£51m), though United value the 27-year-old at a maximum â¬50m (Â£43m). Onana is pushing for the move and as reported earlier this week, has turned down interest from Saudi Arabia in the hope a deal to move to the Premier League can be struck. feed United are set to remain firm in negotiations - as seen in their approach with Chelsea over the transfer of Mason Mount, which was confirmed on Wednesday - and sources close to the Red Devils believe Inter will soften on their asking price as conversations continue. The Italian outfit are in a difficult financial position and need to raise funds to reinvest in the squad - they recently sold Marcelo Brozovic Al-Nassr and are set to replace the Croatian with Davide Frattesi of Sassuolo. They have ambition to bring Romelu Lukaku back to San Siro from Chelsea having lost Edin Dzeko to Fenerbahce on a free transfer. United meanwhile are looking to follow up the signing of Mount, who has been issued the number 7 shirt, with the signing of Onana, though they do have alternatives to fall back on should a deal become too expensive. Atalanta's Rasmus Hojlund is their current top target to bolster their striking options while a second midfielder may also be added to the squad this window, dependent on player sales."
Arsenal reach agreement to sign Jurrien Timber from Ajax,"Jul 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-reach-agreement-to-sign-jurrien-timber-from-ajax,"Arsenal have reached a full agreement to sign defender Jurrien Timber from Ajax, 90min understands. 90min reported last week that the Gunners had seen an offer of an initial fee of â¬42m, with â¬5m in add-ons, accepted by Ajax last week despite the Eredisivie side being keen to get around â¬60m for the player this summer. With finer details and personal terms with the player now agreed too, the talented defender is set to undergo medical before the weekend. Sources have confirmed that Timber's medical could even be before Declan Rice's, with the England star set to undergo his on Friday. feed Rice is set to complete a British-record transfer to Arsenal this week after the Gunners agreed a fee worth Â£100m plus performance related add-ons to sign the gifted midfielder from West Ham. 90min understands that both deals will be officially announced by the end of this week. Timber and Rice will be the Gunners' second and third signings of an extremely active summer transfer window at the Emirates Stadium.

Bruno Fernandes welcomes Mason Mount to Man Utd with hilarious Instagram post,"Jul 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bruno-fernandes-welcomes-mason-mount-man-utd-instagram,"Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes has welcomed Mason Mount to the club with a tongue-in-cheek post on his Instagram story. Mount completed his move to the Red Devils on Wednesday, bringing an end to his 18-year stay at boyhood club Chelsea. Man Utd pursued the England international heavily following the conclusion of the 2022/23 season and made him a priority target. They had three bids rejected by Chelsea before eventually agreeing to a fee of Â£55m, with a further Â£5m potentially to come in add-ons. manual Mount has signed a five-year contract with the option for a further 12 months and spoke of his excitement at joining Man Utd in his unveiling interview, with football director John Murtough hailing him as 'world class'. It seems Mount's arrival has lifted the dressing room too, with vice-captain Fernandes taking to social media to welcome a fellow attacking midfielder in typical combative fashion.

The Red Devils will not, however, be pursuing the permanent signing of Marcel Sabitzer following his loan spell from Bayern Munich. Mount is also capable of playing on either flank and his versatility is expected to prove useful to manager Erik ten Hag."
Thomas Tuchel driving Bayern Munich's pursuit of Harry Kane,"Jul 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/thomas-tuchel-bayern-munich-pursuit-harry-kane,"Bayern Munich remain hopeful of signing Harry Kane from Tottenham Hotspur this transfer window, sources have told 90min. Kane has one year left to run on his contract and talks have stalled over a new deal, while Spurs' incredibly disappointing 2022/23 season has increased speculation of a move away this summer. 90min has long reported that Tottenham are confident of keeping their all-time record scorer and their stance has not changed. Chairman Daniel Levy will currently not entertain bids for Kane and a price tag has not been set or discussed. Spurs are in fact growing in confidence that they can convince Kane to want to stay due to the immediate impact of new head coach Ange Postecoglou, who has made a great impression around the club since confirmation of his appointment last month. But sources have told 90min that Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel believes there is still a chance that Kane could switch clubs in the coming months and is pushing for his signing. The German champions have courted Kane for the last year but their head coach is now driving their interest in the striker, to the extent that Tuchel has convinced Bayern to at least temporarily halt their pursuits of other forward targets such as Eintracht Frankfurt's Randal Kolo Muani. feed Bayern have made no secret of the fact they want to bring in a top-class number nine this window having failed to sign a direct replacement for Robert Lewandowski last summer. 90min recently reported that Tottenham denied they had received an opening â¬70m bid from Bayern, but if they did then it would have been rejected out of hand. Real Madrid had shown an interest in signing Kane and were informed by his camp last week that he would push for an exit, but they are unlikely to make a move for the England captain at this stage. Though Kane has plenty of admirers at the club, president Florentino Perez has made Kylian Mbappe - who has told PSG he will not extend his contract beyond 2024 and so could be sold this summer - Real Madrid's primary target. Los Blancos, like fellow suitors Manchester United, are of the belief that Kane will not be allowed to leave Tottenham and this is also contributing to the prioritising of their plans. If Spurs soften their stance, then Real Madrid's position could change."
Where Mason Mount ranks in Man Utd's most expensive transfers ever,"Jul 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/where-mason-mount-ranks-man-utd-most-expensive-transfers,"Mason Mount's move to Manchester United is finally a done deal. Some will say the Chelsea academy graduate could do with a new PR name - he bade farewell to Blues supporters via a monotonous, hostage-style video message that savvy viewers established had been recorded well in advance due to Mount's Gazza-inspired barnet which is no more - but the focus now is on what's ahead rather than what's been before. A message from Mason Mount to the Chelsea fans ðµâ¤ pic.twitter.com/UyjyA3AlcN The England international has joined Manchester United in a Â£60m deal after refusing to extend his Chelsea contract, having emerged as a star man in west London following his breakthrough 2019/20 campaign. And while he's a talent who divides opinion, there's no doubt that the Blues are worse off without him. However, Chelsea's loss is United's gain and the Red Devils have made Mount one of the most expensive signings in their history. Clubs were put on high alert after Mount rebuffed a new deal from the Blues and it became clear towards the end of the 2022/23 season the crafty midfielder would be leaving this summer despite Mauricio Pochettino's arrival. Arsenal and Liverpool both registered an interest but United quickly established themselves as the frontrunners. The Gunners and Reds chased alternative targets to leave the Red Devils with a free run at the Chelsea man. With his contract at Stamford Bridge expiring in 2024, United had plenty of leverage in negotiations but Chelsea certainly made them work for Mount's signature. The Blues demanded Â£65m; a fee United were hesitant to reach due to Financial Fair Play concerns. The Manchester club tabled offers worth Â£40m, Â£50m and Â£55m, all of which were rejected by Chelsea. It would take a fourth bid of Â£60m (initial Â£55m plus Â£5m in add-ons) to broker a deal with the Blues. With personal terms never an issue, a medical was quickly scheduled and Mount is now officially a Man Utd player. Rank Player Joined from Fee 1. Paul Pogba Juventus Â£89m 2. Antony Ajax Â£82m 3. Harry Maguire Leicester Â£80m 4. Romelu Lukaku Everton Â£75m 5. Jadon Sancho  Borussia Dortmund Â£73m 6. Casemiro Real Madrid Â£70m 7. Bruno Fernandes Sporting CP Â£67.6m 8. Mason Mount Chelsea Â£60m 9. Angel Di Maria Real Madrid Â£59.7m 10. Fred Shakhtar Donetsk Â£52m (fees include potential add-ons) United supporters will be pleading Mount fares better than the vast majority of the names listed on the above table. The Red Devils have a pretty woeful success rate when it comes to big-money signings. Discounting Mount, how many of United's top ten most expensive signings were or have been unmitigated successes? Bruno Fernandes is certainly one, while Casemiro enjoyed a stellar debut season. We'll say two then. The vast majority, including Paul Pogba and Harry Maguire, enjoyed up and down spells at Old Trafford, while Angel Di Maria was a distinct flop. Fred certainly hasn't shown enough to suggest he was worth over Â£50m despite racking up over 200 appearances for the club. Romelu Lukaku started brightly before fading, Jadon Sancho's career is yet to ignite and United massively overpaid the odds to sign Antony from Ajax. Mount, who has become United's eighth most expensive signing ever, will be hoping to follow in the footsteps of Bruno at Old Trafford, not Angel."

Mason Mount bids emotional farewell to Chelsea ahead of Man Utd announcement,"Jul 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/mason-mount-bids-emotional-farewell-chelsea-man-utd-announcement,"Mason Mount has posted a farewell message to Chelsea fans, confirming his departure from the club ahead of a transfer announcement from new team Manchester United.

Andre Onana hopeful of Man Utd transfer despite Saudi Arabia interest,"Jul 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/andre-onana-hopeful-man-utd-transfer-despite-saudi-arabia-interest,"Inter goalkeeper Andre Onana has rejected interest from Saudi Arabia in hope that he can push through a summer transfer to Manchester United, 90min understands. United have identified Onana as their top goalkeeping target with long-term number one David de Gea now a free agent upon the expiry of his contract last Friday. United are still set to speak to the Spaniard to make a clear decision on his future and whether he continues at Old Trafford, but Erik ten Hag has decided Onana is his ideal number one for the new campaign. Whether United can get the transfer over the line remains to be seen, given financial constraints and Ten Hag's ambition to strengthen in a number of positions. But there is optimism that a deal can be done. United are on the verge of committing a large chunk of their transfer budget to Chelsea for Mason Mount, who will imminently be announced as their first summer signing. Mount is to set United back an initial Â£55m, and Ten Hag also wants to sign a new centre forward in addition to a new goalkeeper as a priority. The Dutchman would also like to bringi in a second midfielder before the new season begins, with Fiorentina's Sofyan Amrabat and Southampton's Romeo Lavia of interest. However, that position is lower down the list as it stands and funds may need to be raised through player sales before one does arrive. United are ready to use up a large portion of their existing transfer budget on a goalkeeper and striker, with Onana and Atalanta's Rasmus Hojlund currently top of the agenda. Prices for both deals are currently being negotiated with Inter and Atalanta respectively, and the structure of will be key to each transfer being signed off. 90min reported earlier this week of interest in Hojlund and United are determined not to overpay for the 20-year-old Danish striker. There is distance between theirs and Atalanta's valuations at present but optimism an agreement can be reached. feed United are in a similar boat with Onana, who is Cameroon number one. Ten Hag worked with the player at Ajax and he particularly caught the eye for his distribution in last month's Champions League final, which Inter narrowly lost to Manchester City. Ten Hag wants United's distribution to improve from the back - a problem seen time and again with De Gea in goal last season. Inter believe Onana is worth â¬60m (Â£51m) after his outstanding performances towards the back end of last season, and want to hold out for that fee but United - who value the 27-year-old at a maximum â¬50m (Â£43m) - believe they are in a strong position in negotiations. The Serie A side are in a tricky financial position themselves and are trying to bring Romelu Lukaku permanently back from Chelsea, but struggling to bring the money together to secure a deal. United have a number of options on what goalkeeper they pursue, are not yet formally parted with De Gea and also have Dean Henderson, who has returned for pre-season training, to fall back on. United are also monitoring other targets, such as Feyenoord's Justin Bijlow, who is the current Dutch number one. It's understood by 90min that the player and his representatives do not believe he is United's first choice target, and are treating the situation as such as it stands. Feyenoord don't want to sell in an ideal world after impressively winning the Eredivisie last season under Arne Slot, though would part ways with the 25-year-old at Â£25m if United were to formalise their interest. Slot himself is understood to know such a price is good value which can be reinvested. The player would be expected to push for the move should it materialise, but United's priorities are with Onana for the time being."
Barcelona agree â¬40m transfer for coveted Brazilian teenager,"Jul 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-agree-40m-transfer-brazilian-teenager-vitor-roque,"Barcelona have agreed a deal with Athletico Paranaense that will see them land teenager Vitor Roque. But the Brazil forward wonât make the switch until January, 90min understands. Roque made his senior international debut in March less than a month after turning 18. By then, he already had nearly a year with Athletico under his belt and had previously broken into the first-team at Cruzeiro â the same that club that handed Ronaldo his debut 30 years ago. Barcelona had long been considered favourites to land Roque, but they still had to overcome rival Premier League interest to secure a deal. Arsenal and Chelsea were both in touch with his representatives, with Manchester United and Newcastle keeping an eye on things further afield. A switch to Camp Nou had also been the playerâs own preference. feed Having been close to agreeing a deal with Athletico last month, where the only hurdle left to clear on a â¬40m transfer was the structure of it, Barcelona have now finalised things. A five-year deal with Roque has also been agreed until 2028. However, 90min understands that budget limitations at Barcelona saw them ask to delay his actual arrival in Catalonia until January. By that point, the club will have had more opportunity to clear the decks and make room for him as financial issues continue to impact football operations. The delay in proceedings will also give Roque the opportunity to finish the 2023 Brazilian season, which runs until December, with Athletico. Barcelona winger Raphinha has already been asked for his opinion on his Selecao colleague: ""I hope he will become my teammate at Barcelona. We're talking about a high quality football player.

The Ivorian was restricted to just seven La Liga starts during the 2022/23 campaign, although he was able to contribute perhaps the most memorable Barca goal of the season - a last minute winner against Real Madrid in March that all-but sealed the league title for the club.

Allan Saint-Maximin targeted by Saudi Pro League,"Jul 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/allan-saint-maximin-targeted-saudi-pro-league,"Newcastle United winger Allan Saint-Maximin is emerging as the latest Premier League star to be targeted by the Saudi Pro League, 90min understands. The Frenchman saw his game time limited last season, making just 12 Premier League starts, and is understood to be considering his options in the long-term. Although there are three years left on his current contract, Newcastle don't see a new deal beyond that as an option. 90min understands that a number of clubs have checked on his situation, including Premier League rivals Everton and Crystal Palace. Champions League semi-finalists AC Milan and French giants Marseille are also believed to have shown an interest from the continent. However, additional interest has emerged from Saudi Arabia and it could see Newcastle majority owners PIF sanctioning a move to one of the four Pro League teams they control - Al Nassr, Al Hilal, Al Ittihad and Al Ahli. feed Newcastle are looking to bolster their squad this summer and have already landed Italy international midfielder Sandro Tonali from AC Milan. But they are trying to ensure they comply with Financial Fair Play regulations, which means they need to keep one eye on their wage bill. The Magpies have limited the amount of huge salaries they pay at the top end, but their squad is too big and they hope to move on a host of names this summer. That means the likes of Matt Ritchie, Jamaal Lascelles, Martin Dubravka, Karl Darlow, Ryan Fraser, Jamal Lewis, Javi Manquillo and Jeff Hendrick could depart. In terms of bringing in a big sale, Saint-Maximin would be the most likely. It remains to be seen whether at this point of his career Saint-Maximin would be willing to leave European football, given he is only 26 years of age. He has been at Newcastle since 2019, but has returned just 12 Premier League goals in 111 appearances in the competition."
Five players Chelsea could target to replace Mason Mount,"Jul 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/five-players-chelsea-replace-mason-mount,"Chelsea have made a productive start on the outgoings front this summer, but Mason Mount's impending exit to Manchester United undoubtedly stings. It didn't take long for the academy graduate to endear himself to the Stamford Bridge faithful following his first-team breakthrough in 2019, with some regarding Mount as a potential future skipper in west London as his prestige ascended.  However, a complex contract situation has forced the Blues into a corner and United's interest finally culminated in an agreement with Chelsea that'll see Mount move to Old Trafford in a Â£60m deal. It's a killer blow for new boss Mauricio Pochettino, who supposedly wanted Mount as part of his setup. The England international could've lined up as a box-to-box in a midfield three or as a more advanced playmaker in Poch's favoured 4-2-3-1. The onus could be on Conor Gallagher to fill Mount's void, but it's likely that Chelsea will venture into the market in search of a replacement, Here are five options.  Age: 21Club: Celta VigoA whole host of clubs are keen on signing Celta Vigo starlet Gabri Veiga this summer. Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City are the latest to show interest, with Chelsea understood to have identified the Spaniard as a potential Mount replacement.Veiga is available for less than Â£35m and is a creative midfielder with bags of potential. The 21-year-old broke out in La Liga last season and concluded the campaign by scoring his tenth and 11th league goals against Barcelona to ensure Celta remained in the top flight. Veiga is a risk-taker in possession and an opportunistic creator who loves to take players on. He's a crowd-pleaser that's for sure, and a talent who'll benefit from Pochettino's coaching. Age: 28Club: LazioMilinkovic-Savic has been perpetually linked with a move away from Lazio seemingly ever since he arrived in the Eternal City.The Serb has developed into one of Serie A's best, with Juventus and several Premier League clubs often keeping a close eye on his situation at Lazio. Mount's exit has sparked rumours in the Italian media of a potential Chelsea pursuit for the towering midfielder. Milinkovic-Savic contrasts wildly in profile to Mount, but he's an utterly unique talent with a rare skill set and should the Biancocolesti not demand an extortionate fee, he's a player Chelsea might fancy taking a look at. Age: 21Club: Bayern MunichDutch midfielder Ryan Gravenberch has endured a pretty wretched 12 months. After enduring a mightily frustrating debut season at Bayern, he was then dumped out of the Under-21 European Championships in the group stages last month.The midfielder has previously drawn comparisons to Paul Pogba, but his situation in Bavaria is a curious one. Despite his distinct talent, he's not guaranteed a starting role next season and potential suitors could look to take advantage despite his eagerness to stay put.While he wouldn't be the ideal double pivot partner for Enzo Fernandez in a 4-2-3-1, Gravenberch previously excelled on the left side of a three-man midfield at Ajax.  Age: 26Club: InterBarella joined Inter as an unassuming arrival from Cagliari, but he quickly emerged as one of Serie A's - then Europe's - premier midfielders under Antonio Conte and now Simone Inzaghi.The indefatigable Italian is a manager's dream who wears his heart on his sleeve every time he takes to the field. Barella has continued to mature in Milan, and he played a starring role as Inter reached the Champions League final last season.The relentless 26-year-old would fit in with Poch's pressing ideals, and he appears a good fit for the right-sided creative role in the Argentine's potential 4-2-3-1. Inter won't want to lose him, however, and will demand a hefty fee if Chelsea do come in for him."
Hakim Ziyech fires dig at Al Nassr over failed medical,"Jul 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/hakim-ziyech-fires-dig-at-al-nassr-over-failed-medical,"Chelsea winger Hakim Ziyech has taken to social media to make fun of his failed move to Al Nassr. The Morocco international was set to join the Saudi Pro League side on a lucrative contract and become a teammate of Cristiano Ronaldo. However, 90min reported last week that a deal hung in the balance as a medical unearthed that Ziyech had a knee problem. Al Nassr tried to renegotiate his contract as a result but could not come to an agreement, despite Chelsea's willingness to lower the transfer fee and get a deal over the line. Ziyech is now back on holiday ahead of his scheduled return to Cobham for pre-season training and has spent some time back on the pitch, putting his supposedly problematic knee to the test and laughing at Al Nassr's assessment on his Instagram story. âKnee problems, right?â. ðHakim Ziyech after reports of medical tests failed @ Al Nassr. pic.twitter.com/OBnvE4xaYq manual If the transfer had gone through, Ziyech would have become the fourth player to swap Stamford Bridge for Saudi Arabia this summer. N'Golo Kante joined champions Al Ittihad upon the expiry of his contract at the end of June, linking up with reigning Ballon d'Or winner Karim Benzema. Kalidou Koulibaly was then signed by Al Hilal, ending his one-year stint at Chelsea, while goalkeeper Edouard Mendy was sold to Al Ahli. Meanwhile, Mateo Kovacic and Kai Havertz have made moves to other Premier League clubs, heading to Manchester City and Arsenal respectively. Mason Mount's deal to join Manchester United is expected to be announced shortly."
Thiago makes decision on lucrative offer from Saudi Arabia,"Jul 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/thiago-makes-decision-lucrative-offer-saudi-arabia,"Liverpool midfielder Thiago has rejected the offer of a lucrative move to Saudi Arabia, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Saudi Pro League has flexed its huge financial muscles this summer, tempting the likes of Karim Benzema, N'Golo Kante and Kalidou Koulibaly into following in the footsteps of Cristiano Ronaldo, who joined Al Nassr at the beginning of the year. Former Liverpool manager Steven Gerrard is also now employed in the Middle East, taking the Al Ettifaq job on Monday, and 90min understands that Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho are on his immediate list of transfer targets. The interest in Liverpool players past and present doesn't stop there, with Spanish midfielder Thiago also approached about heading over to Saudi Arabia. But sources have told 90min that the 32-year-old has rejected the opportunity to discuss a move away from Anfield, and has no current ambition to leave the club. manual Jurgen Klopp is also keen for Thiago to stick around around Liverpool and help usher in a new era at the club, which has already seen significant movement in the transfer market. The Reds signed Alexis Mac Allister from Brighton early in June and followed that signing up by completing a deal for RB Leizpig's Dominik Szoboszlai. The Reds have paid the Hungarian's release clause, worth around Â£60m, and have handed him the number eight shirt previously worn by Naby Keita and made famous on the back of Gerrard. Links to Saudi Arabia for Thiago are perhaps no surprise given his injury record at Anfield, which has significantly impacted his number of minutes. In three seasons, the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich midfielder has played in just 67 Premier League games and featured in just 18 top-flight matches during 2022/23. His experience may be crucial though in helping to bed Mac Allister and Szoboszlai in at Anfield, with both players expected to help Liverpool push themselves back into title contention after finishing a lowly fifth last season."
Timeline of Man Utd's links with Frenkie de Jong,"Jul 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/timeline-man-utd-links-frenkie-de-jong-transfer,"There were less than ten minutes of the 2017 Europa League final remaining when Ajax manager Peter Bosz tried one last ploy to break down Jose Mourinho's stubborn Manchester United. On came a 20-year-old Frenkie de Jong. He would make little impact as United saw out a 2-0 victory but the Dutch midfielder has been tethered to the Old Trafford club throughout almost every subsequent transfer window. That De Jong was left on the bench for the final was no surprise at the time. The whispy midfielder only properly broke into the first-team the following season, before later flourishing under the thousand-yard stare of Erik ten Hag. Long before Ten Hag took charge of United, links of a move for De Jong had emerged. Here is a look at how the rumours and whispers have grown over the years. De Jong's parents - who named their child after the band Frankie Goes to Hollywood - were not the only ones paying close attention to their son's first start for the national team. United had reportedly sent scouts to the Netherlands' 2-1 defeat against France in the UEFA Nation's League to check out the wriggling youngster. Tottenham had supposedly seen a Â£45m bid rebuffed the previous summer but Barcelona were rightly ranked as favourites. Intriguingly, the scout that recommended De Jong to United after that trip, Derek Langley, was 'removed' from the club after a frank discussion with chief executive Ed Woodward about the transfer targets that had been overlooked. In January 2019, De Jong agreed to his 'dream' move to Barcelona for â¬75m just three years after visiting Camp Nou as a spectator. Manchester City - rather than United - were Barcelona's closest rivals in the race for his signature. As De Jong embarked upon a patchy adaptation period in Catalonia, rumours of a move to United subsided. But they would be back. Barcelona were economically crippled by the coronavirus pandemic which initially suspended football before forcing all matches behind closed doors. With the largest wage bill in the sport, the lack of revenue was catastrophic. Rival clubs quickly smelled blood and began sniffing around Barcelona's saleable assets; chief among which was De Jong. In the winter of 2021, De Jong's father John claimed that 'the five top European clubs have all called'. It was implied that United were one of the interested suitors but De Jong Sr suggested that the 'bad weather there' could hamper the club's chances of snagging his son. As soon as a manager moves to a new club, they are immediately linked with all of the star players they just left. This is an easy and lazy rumour to spread. Inevitably, in the same month that the Dutchman was announced as Ralf Rangnick's permanent successor at Old Trafford, De Jong's name was straight back in the gossip columns. However, Ten Hag's business upon arrival at Old Trafford has tended to revolve around known variables. When United's bid for Ajax's Jurrien Timber was rebuffed, his teammate Lisandro Martinez made the move, before winger Antony followed the same path. De Jong hasn't been reunited with his old boss just yet. The rumour mill began to audibly whirr as the 2022 summer transfer window drew nearer. United were supposedly prepared to make De Jong the club's highest-paid player as they sought a replacement for the departing midfielder Paul Pogba. However, at the same time, reports emerged that De Jong was underwhelmed by United's approach. It appeared that the presence of Ten Hag did not make up for a lack of Champions League football and the player's ultimate desire to stay in Barcelona. De Jong may have been uncertain - the midfielder would go no further than politely accepting that he was 'flattered' by the interest - but Barcelona were more than happy to negotiate an exit for their expensive midfielder. If Barcelona had reluctantly elbowed Lionel Messi out of Camp Nou the year before due to their financial limitations, they had no qualms about accepting a hefty fee for De Jong. After an initial offer of â¬60m was rejected by the cash-strapped club, multiple sources reported that Barcelona had agreed to a sum in the region of â¬65m. However, De Jong was emphatically not on the same page. With talk of the fee rising as high as â¬80m, De Jong had to forcefully make his position clear. As the player explained in the following summer: ""The club was in a difficult situation. They were able to sell me for a big fee, and they wanted to do this, but I did not want to leave so I stayed."" One of the sticking points was the deferred wages Barcelona owed De Jong. The Dutchman was part of the squad which set aside their salary during the height of the pandemic but never entirely wrote off that money. As Barcelona reluctantly pay De Jong what he is owed, he will be the top earner in all of La Liga for the 2023/24 season. In mid-August, a self-imposed deadline reportedly passed which forced United to withdraw all agreements that had been made in their bid to sign De Jong. Barcelona had tried their best to make Catalonia as hostile as possible for the midfielder, with Xavi Hernandez purposefully deploying De Jong as an uncomfortable centre-back during pre-season. De Jong admitted there was a 'situation' with club president Joan Laporta but he eventually dug his heels deep enough. However, Ten Hag was not deterred. Another transfer window rolled around and more links between United and De Jong unsurprisingly followed. Despite repeatedly stressing his desire to remain in Spain in public, De Jong supposedly told Ten Hag in private that he was ""happy to join Barcelona"". Named as one of four players 'not for sale' by Barcelona president Laporta that month, De Jong duly stayed put. Gluttons for punishment, United still have De Jong sitting atop their list of transfer targets, 90min understands."
Thomas Muller admits he 'likes' Harry Kane,"Jul 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/thomas-muller-admits-he-likes-harry-kane,"Thomas Muller has been asked about the possibility of Tottenham Hotspur's Harry Kane joining him at Bayern Munich this summer. The Bavarian giants have courted the striker for nearly a year now, with former manager Julian Nagelsmann first revealing his and the club's admiration of Kane in late July of 2022. 90min extensively reported throughout the 2022/23 season that Bayern were keeping tabs on Kane ahead of a potential summer transfer. Bayern had an opening bid knocked back by Spurs last week, while 90min understands Kane's camp have made it known to other European heavyweights like Real Madrid and PSG that he is looking to leave. However, Tottenham are confident that he will end the transfer window still at the club. Muller, who is only 34 games away from equalling Sepp Maier's all-time appearance record at Bayern with 700, was asked by BILD about the club's pursuit of Kane. ""I've actually told myself that as long as something is not done, it's not worth talking about,"" Muller said. When asked if he 'likes' Kane, Muller laughed and replied: ""I don't know anyone that doesn't like him!"" feed Bayern are on the hunt for a new striker after just about surviving the 2022/23 season without bringing in a replacement for Robert Lewandowski following his transfer to Barcelona. Die Roten needed a final-day Borussia Dortmund collapse to win their 11th-straight Bundesliga title, and fell disappointingly short in both the Champions League and DFB-Pokal. Their top scorer in the Bundesliga was winger Serge Gnabry with 14 goals, while Kane notched 30 in the Premier League for a struggling Spurs side."
Joan Laporta reveals Barcelona have rejected offers for eight players,"Jul 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/joan-laporta-barcelona-reject-offers-eight-players,"Joan Laporta has insisted Barcelona are 'not a selling club' after revealing the names of eight players La Blaugrana have turned down offers for. Barca's financial plight in recent years has been well-documented, with the club being forced to sell Lionel Messi after they could not register his contract, and then being unable to re-sign the Argentine legend this summer despite the player's desire to return to Camp Nou.  Club president Laporta even recently revealed that, due to being forced to defer some of Messi's wages during his time at the club, Barcelona will continue to pay the player until 2025. ""What is owed to him is the deferral of the salary bill that was agreed with the previous board and that produces pending payments that end in 2025,"" Laporta remarked. Despite the club's monetary issues, Barcelona remain keen on strengthening Xavi's squad with high-profile signings - Joshua Kimmich and Bernardo Silva among those to be on Barca's shortlist - and are expected to make moves before the transfer window closes. Barcelona also have no intention of parting ways with any of their key players, which is something Laporta referenced in an interview with La Vanguardia. Indeed, he named eight current stars that the club have turned down offers for, reaffirming the Catalan giants are not in the business of being a selling club. There are offers for [Andreas] Christensen, for Pedri, for Gavi, for [Ronald] AraÃºjo, for [Marc Andre] ter Stegen, for Ansu [Fati], for Raphinha, for [Alejandro] Balde. But we are not a selling club,"" Laporta said. feed â[Iâd tell Ansu] to continue. He has to earn Xaviâs trust and when he plays make a difference because he has the talent he can do it.â 90min understands that Fati has been a target for Premier League sides Wolves and West Ham United during the summer transfer window, although the player isn't keen on making a move to clubs who finished in the lower half of England's top flight last season.  In the higher reaches of the Premier League, interest has been rife for Raphinha and Gavi in particular, with the former being near the top of Arsenal's shortlist of potential right wing targets, and the latter previously being targeted by Manchester City and Liverpool.  Gavi's contract renewal was eventually registered by Barcelona in June, some nine months after he originally put pen to paper on a new deal. LISTEN NOW"
FIFA's stance on players at Ukrainian clubs - explained,"Jul 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/fifa-ukrainian-clubs-explained,"The legendary Dutch coach Rinus Michels has often had the blunt sentiment: ""Football is war"" incorrectly assigned to him. What the former Ajax and Netherlands manager actually said was closer to: ""Football is something like war. Whoever behaves too properly is lost."" In the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, FIFA has been tasked with setting the guidelines for proper behaviour in the relatively inconsequential realm of football amid the conflict. However, Ukrainian clubs - spearheaded by reigning champions Shakhtar Donetsk - have felt persecuted by FIFA's regulations. Shakhtar even took world football's governing body to court in search of ""reparations"". With the summer transfer window in full swing, here's everything you need to know about FIFA's stance on players and managers at Ukrainian clubs and how it could affect the market. In an uncharacteristic demonstration of speed, FIFA released a set of ""temporary rulesaddressing the exceptional situation deriving from the war in Ukraine"" within a fortnight of Russian troops entering Kharkiv in 2022. Under the new measures, foreign players and coaches could unilaterally suspend their contracts with clubs from the football federations of Ukraine or Russia for the rest of the 2021/22 season. FIFA outlined the aim of this ruling was ""to protect foreign players and coaches who have left the territory of Ukraine or Russia due to the conflict and who do not wish to currently return in view of the circumstances"". After stretching the measures through the 2022/23 campaign, FIFA revealed that the ruling would be extended again on Monday 22 May 2023. Much to the disgust of clubs from Ukraine and Russia, foreign players and coaches can suspend their contracts in both countries until 30 June 2024 - as long as they let the club know, in writing, by 1 July 2023, per Annexe 7 of FIFA's Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players (RSTP). However, players and coaches can only suspend their contract if they did not extend their existing deal after the ruling was first put in place on 7 March 2022. As FIFA explained in a statement released alongside the updated rules: ""Foreign players and coaches who have, despite the war in Ukraine, decided to arrive in, return to, or not leave the territory of Ukraine or Russia, cannot rely on the revised Annexe 7 to the RSTP to suspend an ongoing contract."" According to Annexe 7, players who have had their contracts extended ""would not be able, during the period of suspension, to be subject to a transfer (whether permanent or on loan) against payment"" - i.e. a player who has suspended their contract with a Ukrainian club cannot be transferred for a fee during their suspension. That particular wrinkle is why so many foreign players have either departed on free transfers or moved on an initial loan deal. FC Shakhtar CEO Serhii Palkin met with Katarina Pijetlovic, General Secretary of the Union of European Clubs, in Kyiv.#Shakhtar #Ukraine pic.twitter.com/PuXvBNvGS7 Shakhtar Donetsk's CEO Sergei Palkin has launched a public assault on FIFA's stance since the amendments were released.  With a prolific youth system and revered Brazilian scouting network, Shakhtar have routinely commanded large sums from player sales in the transfer market, generating millions of euros from the likes of Fernandinho, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Fred over the years. The reigning Ukrainian champions took FIFA to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2022 demanding at least â¬40m in reparations of transfer fees they believe they would have earned had it not been for FIFA's ruling. CAS dismissed the case, judging that the regulations ""were not grossly disproportionate"" but Shakhtar filed a complaint before the European Union Commission in March. In the wake of yet another extension, Palkin claimed that Shakhtar are willing to legally challenge any team trying to extract their assets for free. ""I would like to send a message to those clubs who are trying to sign our players without paying a transfer fee,"" Palkin told ESPN. ""Shakhtar will file claims for unjust enrichment against players or clubs who have enriched themselves and benefitted by obtaining a financial advantage. ""We believe these clubs who enrich themselves at Shakhtar's expense will be obliged to pay restitutions. Those clubs should understand what they do when they decide to sign our players."" Manor Solomon is the most high-profile player currently under contract at a Ukrainian club. The Israel international spent last season on loan from Shakhtar at Fulham, scoring in five consecutive appearances as February bled into March. Tottenham have agreed terms with the forward but he is still under contract at Shakhtar until the end of the calendar year. As Solomon is a foreign player, has not extended his deal with the club and has not returned to the war zone, Annexe 7 should allow him to unilaterally suspend his Shakhtar contract as long as he told the club by 1 July 2023. However, Palkin warned: ""If you go to Tottenham, we will deal with Tottenham in court in this case."" The Brazilian winger Tete enjoyed less success in the Premier League. Despite scoring on his debut for Leicester, the 23-year-old couldn't help the Foxes avoid relegation. Much like Solomon, Tete also has six months left on his Shakhtar contract."

Transfer notebook: Gerrard wants Tavernier in Saudi Arabia; Leeds set to lose Aaronson,"Jul 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/transfer-notebook-gerrard-tavernier-saudi-arabia-leeds-aaronson,"New Al Ettifaq manager Steven Gerrard is interested in reuniting with Rangers captain James Tavernier, who is also interesting a number of other Saudi Pro League clubs. Gerrard was appointed as the Saudi side's new manager on Monday, returning to the dugout less than nine months after being sacked as Aston Villa manager. He previously enjoyed a successful three-year spell in charge of Rangers, leading the club to the Scottish Premiership title in 2020/21, and one of his key assets during that success was Tavernier. 31-year-old Tavernier has played over 400 games for Rangers in all competitions, but could be offered the chance to reunite with Gerrard as he looks to add some high-profile European experience to his squad. Philippe Coutinho and Jordan Henderson are two established former teammates of Gerrard who are being targeted, while there's also interest in luring Gini Wijnaldum away from Paris Saint-Germain on a permanent basis. Premier League new boys Burnley have agreed a deal with Manchester City for young goalkeeper James Trafford. The 20-year-old has proven his talent during an 18-month loan spell with Bolton Wanderers, helping the club reach last season's League One play-offs before sharing the club's Young Player of the Year award with Conor Bradley. A permanent transfer worth Â£19m has now been agreed with Manchester City, comprising of Â£14m in guaranteed money plus Â£5m in performance related add-ons, and Trafford will compete with another former City alumni, Arijanet Muric, for a starting berth. The Clarets have also agreed a loan deal with Borussia Dortmund for teenage defender Soumaila Coulibaly. Vincent Kompany will have the option of making the move permanent at the end of the season for around Â£12m. Former Norwich City manager Daniel Farke will return to the dugout in England after signing a contract at Leeds United. The Whites were relegated last season after cycling through Jesse Marsch, Javi Gracia and Sam Allardyce, the latter of whom was unable to keep the club afloat after coming in for the final few games of 2022/23. Leeds' bid to be promoted from the Championship will take place without American attacking midfielder Brenden Aaronson, who is set to join Union Berlin on loan with an option to buy. The 22-year-old scored just once in 36 Premier League appearances last season, having joined the club for just shy of Â£25m in May 2022. AC Milan are interested in signing Chelsea winger Christian Pulisic this summer, but they do have other options in mind should a deal for the American fail to come to fruition. Samuel Chukwueze and Jesper Lindstrom, of Villarreal and Eintracht Frankfurt respectively, are both on the Rossoneri's shortlist and could represent good value for money when their weekly pay packet is compared to Pulisic's. Milan rewarded Rafael Leao with a new contract recently but are keen to strengthen their forward options after qualifying once more for the Champions League. Bournemouth are one of a number of teams keeping tabs on AZ Alkmaar teenager Milos Kerkez. The 19-year-old has risen to prominence after a superb debut season in AZ's first team, with his ability on show in the club's Europa Conference League semi-final tie with West Ham. The Hammers also hold an interest in Kerkez, along with a number of other clubs, but Bournemouth are ready to open talks in a bid to get a deal over the line. The Cherries hope to make up to half a dozen new signings, providing new manager Andoni Iraola with some fresh firepower for the new season. Former Chelsea, Real Madrid and Juventus striker Alvaro Morata is the latest high-profile player being targeted by the Saudi Pro League. The 30-year-old scored 13 La Liga goals for Atletico Madrid last season after spending two years on loan in Italy, and took over as captain of Spain's national team in March."
Steven Gerrard keen to bring Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho to Saudi Arabia,"Jul 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/steven-gerrard-jordan-henderson-philippe-coutinho-saudi-arabia,"New Al Ettifaq manager Steven Gerrard is interested in bringing former Liverpool teammates Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho to Saudi Arabia, 90min understands. Al Ettifaq confirmed the appointment of Gerrard on Monday after the former Rangers and Aston Villa boss originally rejected the club's proposal at the end of June. 90min understands that Gerrard was hoping to secure jobs with either Leicester City or Leeds United but agreed to join the Saudi Pro League club when it became apparent that he would not land either role in England. Gerrard has been promised 'huge' funds in order to rebuild an Al Ettifaq side which finished seventh last season - 30 points off Asian Champions League qualification and just nine points clear of the relegation zone - and the legendary midfielder has requested the club make offers for two of his former Liverpool teammates. Sources have confirmed to 90min that both current Liverpool captain Henderson and Aston Villa star Coutinho are on Gerrard's radar this summer. Henderson currently has two years left on his current contract at Anfield, having signed a four-year deal back in 2021. Despite his advancing years, the 33-year-old has remained a valuable squad player for Jurgen Klopp, making 41 appearances in all competitions last season.  The midfielder played alongside Gerrard during the first four years of his now 12-year career at Liverpool, winning the League Cup together in the 2011/12 season. feed 90min understands that despite Gerrard's eagerness to make a move for Henderson, it will be extremely difficult to convince him to make the move to Saudi Arabia this summer. Although a move for Henderson may not be possible, sources have confirmed that one for Coutinho is. The club believe that the Brazil international is interested in making the move to Al Ettifaq in order to link up with his former teammate and manager. Gerrard and Coutinho spent three seasons together in Liverpool's midfield, striking up a real partnership as the creative hub of the Reds' team at the time. Since then, Gerrard has also worked with Coutinho in a coaching capacity, signing the Brazilian during his short stint as Aston Villa manager. Coutinho has struggled for game time at Villa Park since Gerrard was sacked in October 2022, making just seven starts in the Premier League during the 2022/23 campaign, and his lack of minutes under Unai Emery could be a key factor in whether or not he leaves this summer.

Brighton are prepared to admit defeat and look at other left-sided centre-back targets, and 90min understands they have opened talks with Ajax over Nigeria international Bassey. The 23-year-old made the move to Amsterdam last summer after impressing in his first two senior seasons at Rangers, helping them to the 2022 Europa League final. feed But Bassey has failed to find his feet in the Netherlands and Ajax will consider offers for the defender, with Brighton hoping to agree terms on a Â£15m deal. Bassey is a long-term target of Brighton, who have been admirers since his days at Rangers. He would provide much-needed European experience as the Seagulls make their first venture into the Europa League next season.

Man Utd offered chance to sign Sofyan Amrabat,"Jul 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-offered-chance-to-sign-sofyan-amrabat,"Manchester United have been offered the chance to rival Atletico Madrid for Fiorentina midfielder Sofyan Amrabat, sources have told 90min. The 26-year-old shot to global fame as one of Morocco's best players in their run to the semi-finals at the 2022 World Cup.

The Reds have brought in two attacking midfielders so far this summer in Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai. Barcelona made an audacious loan offer for Amrabat midway through the 2022/23 season which was knocked back by Fiorentina, while Tottenham came close to signing him in January 2022 before bringing in Rodrigo Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski from Juventus instead. Fiorentina CEO Joe Barone confirmed earlier this week that the club will listen to offers for Amrabat, but have not yet received any. ""We have not received any bid or proposal for him at all. He's Fiorentina player now. If an offer comes, we will consider it,"" he said."

Arsenal set to confirm contract extensions for first team duo,"Jul 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-set-confirm-contract-extensions-first-team-duo,"Contract extensions for defender William Saliba and winger Reiss Nelson are set to be confirmed by Arsenal this week, 90min understands. The Gunners agreed a new four-year deal with French defender Saliba earlier in June. His previous contract was due to expire at the end of next season and elite sides throughout Europe had registered their interest. Saliba formed an excellent partnership with Gabriel Magalhaes in defence in his first proper campaign with Arsenal and was never pushing for a move away from the Emirates this summer. Recent contracts have recently been confirmed for Gabriel Martinelli, Bukayo Saka and Aaron Ramsdale and a new deal for Nelson is also close to being finalised. The 23-year-old had previously spent time on loan with Hoffenheim and Feyenoord and only played in six Arsenal games before the World Cup. feed He returned two goals and three assists in 11 substitute appearances in the Premier League last season in total, including a star turn from the bench in a 3-2 win over Bournemouth in March.

Having been something of a Gunners pariah at the start of Mikel Arteta's reign, the Switzerland international has enjoyed the best form of his spell in England during the past two seasons as his side came fifth and second in the Premier League. Arsenal had been impressed by Xhaka's attitude during the 2022/23 season and were keen to keep him but the midfielder backed away from talks over a new deal and was later told he could leave north London this summer. Xhaka had one year left on his Arsenal contract but will soon be confirmed as a new Bayer Leverkusen signing. The Bundesliga side, who came sixth in 2022/23, have put together a package totalling â¬25m to sign the 30-year-old who scored 23 goals in 297 appearances in all competitions for the Gunners.

Al Nassr confirm signing of Inter midfielder Marcelo Brozovic,"Jul 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/al-nassr-confirm-signing-inter-midfielder-marcelo-brozovic,"Al Nassr have completed the signing of Inter midfielder Marcelo Brozovic on a three-year contract. The 30-year-old is the latest high-profile player to move to the riches of the Middle East, where he'll link up with Cristiano Ronaldo. A number of Premier League players have already departed for Saudi Arabia - Kalidou Koulibaly, Edouard Mendy and N'Golo Kante headlining a mass exodus from Chelsea - while the league's biggest acquisition is perhaps Karim Benzema - he's joined champions Al Ittihad after opting to end an illustrious trophy-laden stint at Real Madrid. 90min revealed that Brozovic had been courted by Barcelona as they looked to replace Sergio Busquets in the anchor role, but the Croatian has been lured to Saudi Arabia on a big-money contract. ""When it comes to a player, many factors take over,"" Inter CEO Beppe Marotta told Sky Italia about a potential exit for Brozovic earlier in the week. ""Clearly the economic one is the most important one.  ""The situation is not closed and is not defined. Who decides is the player himself. We are not obligated to give him up. The biggest problem is the contractual relationship between him and the new club. ""If there is a solution we will close the issue, otherwise we will take him off the market."" manual Inter had been willing to part ways with Brozovic in a bid to raise money this summer, and further outgoings are expected at San Siro in a bid to balance the club's books. Lautaro Martinez has been interesting Real Madrid, Chelsea and Manchester United, while goalkeeper Andre Onana is of particular interest to the latter amid continued uncertainty over the future of David de Gea. The Nerazzurri are at least hopeful of concluding a deal for Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku, but their outgoings will need to significantly outweigh any incomings in a bid to be compliant with FFP rules. Al Nassr have also made an attempt to sign Crystal Palace talisman Wilfried Zaha, who is now out of contract, in addition to moving for Hakim Ziyech - his move is on hold though after issues arose in his medical, leading the Saudi side to change the terms of their original offer."
Wolves open to selling Max Kilman despite rejecting Napoli offer,"Jul 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/wolves-open-selling-max-kilman-rejecting-napoli-offer,"Wolves are open to selling defender Max Kilman this summer despite rejecting an offer from Serie A champions Napoli, 90min understands. Napoli could soon lose starting centre-back Kim Min-jae to Bayern Munich, with the late-blooming Kilman emerging on the radar at Estadio Diego Armando Maradona after becoming an important part of the Wolves back-line since breaking through in 2021. Sources have confirmed to 90min that a bid of â¬35m (Â£30m) was put forward by Napoli for the 26-year-old, who has never been capped at full international level but was formerly an England futsal player. Wolves turned it down, but they are still open to the idea of cashing in on a player they plucked from non-league football in 2018. Kilman himself is also not against the idea of leaving Molineux - Chris Smalling and Fikayo Tomori have set a strong precedent for English centre-backs doing well in Italy. Although â¬35m wasnât enough to prompt a sale, an improved â¬40m (Â£34m) offer could be. Wolves have already sold Ruben Neves for big money so far this summer, allowing the Portugal midfielder to join Al Hilal in Saudi Arabia for a fee in the region of Â£45m. feed The West Midlands club are having to contend with what manager Julen Lopetegui described shortly before the end of the Premier League season as âproblemsâ with Financial Fair Play. ""There are some Financial Fair Play problems I didn't know before,"" Lopetegui explained at the time following a meeting with chairman Jeff Shi. ""I hope we will solve this issue. It's very difficult to compete in the Premier League without investment. Despite the club investing this year it has been a very hard year so we have to learn the lesson and do our homework to try to improve the team."" Wolves recorded losses of more than Â£40m in their most recent set of accounts for 2021/22, with Premier League rules outlawing losses in excess of Â£105m over a three-year period. The club was profitable to the tune of Â£21m in 2020/21, but had posted sizeable losses over Â£36m for 2019/20. The 2022/23 figures are not publicly available, but more big losses in those accounts would mean counting the pennies carefully across the coming season to avoid exceeding the limit."

The Magpies are on the look out for squad depth as they prepare to return to the Champions League and are eyeing players with European experience, which has led them in Chelsea's direction. Chelsea have already agreed to over Â£200m worth of sales. But they are still looking to trim their squad further and sources have confirmed to 90min that Newcastle are keeping tabs on a number of players who could potentially be available. One of those on Newcastle's radar is midfielder Gallagher. The 23-year-old was a target back in January and remains high on the Magpies' wish list, with a loan their preferred move at this point. However, with so much interest in Gallagher from across Europe, there is an awareness that Chelsea are unlikely to agree to a temporary move and so Newcastle would be prepared to consider signing the midfielder permanently. Chelsea have not yet made a final decision on Gallagher's future, with club officials keen to give new manager Mauricio Pochettino the chance to work with the England international first. feed Chalobah has also emerged as a potential target for Newcastle, who are looking for a new right-sided centre-back and have registered an interest in the 23-year-old. Like Gallagher, there is plenty of interest in Chalobah. In the Premier League, the defender is on the radars of both Crystal Palace and West Ham, while Serie A giants Inter have also voiced an interest in Chalobah during the ongoing discussions between the two clubs over Romelu Lukaku's future. 90min understands that Chelsea are keen to keep Chalobah, who signed a new six-year contract in November. The academy graduate made 33 appearances in all competitions across 2022/23, providing reliable cover at both centre-back and right-back, although he started fewer than half of Chelsea's Premier League games and is believed to be looking for a greater role next season. With Thiago Silva turning 39 in September, there is also an awareness that the veteran Brazilian may be in his final year at Chelsea and selling Chalobah could leave the Blues short in the future."

Spurs are known to be keen to bolster at centre-back this summer and have explored deals for a handful of targets, most recently making contact with Wolfsburg over Dutchman Micky van de Ven. Another leading Bundesliga centre-back, Edmond Tapsoba of Bayer Leverkusen, is known to be on Spurs' radar - both targets operate on the left-side of a traditional centre-back pairing like Lenglet."

""First of all, I want to thank Newcastle United because they are giving me a huge opportunity for my career,"" Tonali said. ""I want to repay the trust on the pitch, giving it my all, as I always have.

Man Utd continue talks with Atalanta over Rasmus Hojlund transfer,"Jul 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-two-rasmus-hojlund-offers-rejected-atalanta,"Manchester United are looking to continue their transfer plans for the summer by striking a deal with Atalanta for Rasmus Hojlund, 90min understands. Manager Erik ten Hag has identified a new centre forward among his top priorities, with Tottenham's Harry Kane and Napoli's Victor Osimhen initially targeted. United were priced out of signing both players but have now turned their attention to Hojlund, who has also been on their radar for some time. Still only 20, Hojlund only joined Atalanta last August from Austrian outfit Sturm Graz. He hit nine goals in his debut Serie A season and has also made his senior international debut for Denmark over the last year, scoring five times in six caps to date. United's dream scenario for the summer was to add an experienced first choice striker as well as a younger prospect of Hojlund's ilk to fix the position for the long-term. But budgetary restrictions are making matters difficult for them in negotiations. The club's ownership situation has still not been resolved by the Glazer family, despite the process lasting eight months and counting. They also have a decision to make on the future of Mason Greenwood. feed Mason Mount is set to join United in the coming days after a deal worth Â£55m plus Â£5m in add-ons was struck with Chelsea, and the club are now pressing ahead with their next target.  Sources close to Atalanta indicate the Serie A outfit are asking for â¬75m-â¬80m (Â£64m-Â£69m) to consider selling at this stage. Previous reported demands of â¬100m were not deemed serious by United. 90min understands United are not prepared to be held to ransom and are willing to go to â¬60m (Â£51.5m) but not much further to sign the player before the new season. Hojlund's camp believe United's valuation is fair and the player wants to move to Old Trafford. Hojlund has previously admitted he is a United fan, saying earlier this year: ""I will not hide the fact that I am a huge Man Utd fan. So, personally, [playing for them] would be one of the biggest things for me."" Juventus and Napoli are also interested in signing Hojlund. As well as the deal for Mount, United are looking to address their goalkeeping situation this summer having seen David de Gea's contract expire last Friday. The Spaniard is still considering an offer to extend his stay, but there are doubts over his status as long-term number one. United have been interested in Inter's Andre Onana to replace him, while Feyenoord's Justin Bijlow has also been considered."

Teams in Germany, Spain and Turkey have all voiced an interest in the 24-year-old, but sources have confirmed to 90min that it is Milan and Lyon who have made the first formal moves. The two clubs are both keen to sign Pulisic on a permanent deal this summer and are now in talks with Chelsea, who are braced for a significant loss on the Â£58m they paid to sign the American from Borussia Dortmund in 2019. Interest from Milan has been more prominent in recent weeks and the Serie A side are understood to believe Pulisic would prioritise a move to San Siro this summer. feed For Milan, Pulisic is particularly valuable as his Croatian passport means he would not need to take up one of their limited non-EU player spots in their squad. Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who joined from Chelsea last week, has taken up their last available place. Pulisic has spoken openly this summer about his desire for a fresh start, recently confessing to ESPN that he is looking to rediscover his happiness on a football pitch. ""I need to figure out whatâs going to be best for my future and be somewhere where I can go and play and be trusted and feel good in what Iâm doing,"" he admitted. ""I want to find that joy at a club level again, for sure."" Since his expensive move from Dortmund, Pulisic has struggled with both injuries and form. He has managed 145 appearances for Chelsea, racking up 26 goals and 21 assists, and now appears set for a fresh start elsewhere."

RB Leipzig director confirms Josko Gvardiol request to join Man City,"Jul 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/rb-leipzig-director-josko-gvardiol-request-man-city,"RB Leipzig sporting director Max Eberl has confirmed Josko Gvardiol has requested to join Manchester City as talks between the clubs continue. Treble-winning City want reinforcements at the back and were told by the Bundesliga club late in June that a world record fee for a defender would be required for a sale to be facilitated. Interest from Pep Guardiola's side dates back to April. Leipzig have already lost key first team stars like Christopher Nkunku, Konrad Laimer and Dominik Szoboszlai this summer. The departure of Gvardiol, who started 24 league games as his side came third behind champions Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund, would be another hefty blow to the spine of last season's team. ""Gvardiol and his agents gave us their desire to move to Manchester City. We are in talks with City,"" Eberl told LVZ. feed ""Yes, for â¬100m plus bonuses, Gvardiol will end up in Pep's strong hands. The value of the deal would make Gvardiol the most expensiveÂ defender in history. But it might take a few more days."" That transfer fee would eclipse the Â£80m forked out by local rivals Manchester United to Leicester for Harry Maguire back in 2019. Gvardiol had previously been wanted by Chelsea last year but no agreement was ever reached before he signed a new contract with Leipzig.

Manor Solomon agrees Tottenham move but deal faces FIFA checks,"Jul 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/manor-solomon-agrees-tottenham-move-deal-faces-fifa-checks,"Tottenham have agreed personal terms with Israel international winger Manor Solomon but face checks from authorities before a free transfer from Shakhtar Donetsk can be finalised. Solomon spent last season on loan at Fulham, who had an option to purchase the forward whose contract in Ukraine is due to expire in December this year. 90min understands terms have been agreed between Spurs and the 23-year-old, but Shakhtar are pushing for the transfer not to be sanctioned. Annex 7 of the Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players under FIFA law allows players under contract with Ukrainian teams to suspend their deals and move elsewhere. Solomon will hope to sign for free in north London now, but Shakhtar chief executive Sergei Palkin has previously confirmed his club will take potential suitors to court over the transfer. He told ESPN: ""Finally, where he will go, I don't know. In any case, if you go to Tottenham, we will deal with Tottenham in court in this case. Everything comes to a simple situation: it sounds like unjust enrichment. ""Can you imagine, we pay big money for this player and finally Tottenham receives him for free? It is not fair in respect of our club. We will definitely go to court and we will fight for ourselves. feed ""I would like to send a message to those clubs who are trying to sign our players without paying a transfer fee: Shakhtar will file claims for unjust enrichment against players or clubs who have enriched themselves and benefitted by obtaining a financial advantage. ""We believe these clubs who enrich themselves at Shakhtar's expense will be obliged to pay restitutions. Those clubs should understand what they do when they decide to sign our players.""

Liverpool confirm Dominik Szoboszlai shirt number,"Jul 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-confirm-dominik-szoboszlai-shirt-number,"Liverpool signing Dominik Szoboszlai will wear the number eight shirt following his Â£60m arrival at the club from RB Leipzig. The Reds have made Szoboszlai their second signing of the summer after triggering the release clause in his contract. With personal terms already agreed and the Hungarian keen to make the switch to Anfield, he put pen to paper on his new contract in England. The 22-year-old will give Jurgen Klopp several options, capable of operating on either flank or as a 'number 10'. But the digit he will wear on his back is one made famous by Steven Gerrard. Ironically, he shares some other shirt number history with Gerrard, having worn 17 at Leipzig - the ex-Liverpool captain had that jersey at Anfield for four years from 2000. Liverpool fans will hope Szoboszlai will do the iconic number eight, worn by Gerrard for 11 seasons from 2004 until 2015, more proud than previous wearer Naby Keita. The Guinea international also arrived at Anfield from RB Leipzig in a big money transfer, only to see his five years at the club defined by frustrating injuries that limited his opportunities to play. Other Liverpool number eights in the Premier League era include Emile Heskey, Stan Collymore, Oyvind Leonhardsen and Jamie Redknapp. feed Szoboszlai has already highlighted his eagerness to play at Anfield following a previous visit as an away player with former club Red Bull Salzburg in 2019, a game in which Erling Haaland, Takumi Minamino and Hwang Hee-chan all scored for the Austrian club in a 4-3 defeat. ""This time made me feel bad because we lost 4-3! But of course, I've said it before, I've almost never been nervous before the game, I think this was the first time in my life,"" Szoboszlai told club media. ""Of course the stadium, the fans were unbelievable even [though] they were against us [Salzburg]. And we will see how it is when they are with me. ""I heard that it [Anfield] is going to be bigger. Of course counting the days back because it's a really proud time to get on the pitch in Anfield as a player for Liverpool."""
Jurgen Klopp highlights 'proper positives' in Dominik Szoboszlai,"Jul 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jurgen-klopp-highlights-proper-positives-dominik-szoboszlai,"Jurgen Klopp has admitted he is hugely excited to work with new Liverpool signing Dominik Szoboszlai. The Reds triggered Szoboszlai's â¬70m release clause on Friday and wasted little time getting the deal wrapped up, finalising the Hungary international's arrival at Anfield just two days later. Szoboszlai becomes Liverpool's third most expensive signing of all time, behind only Darwin Nunez and Virgil van Dijk, and Klopp is excited to get to work with such a high-profile talent. ""The first thing for me to say is welcome to Liverpool, Dominik,"" Klopp told club media. ""I know how excited he is to be here with us, so it is important that he understands that we are all just as excited to have him. ""We already have a little knowledge of Dominik as an opponent because we had a couple of really tough games against Red Bull Salzburg when he was a player there and I think everyone who saw those fixtures will have realised that even at that stage he was a really interesting prospect. ""I'm pretty sure he was still a teenager at that time and since then he has made some big strides â moving to Leipzig, doing really, really well in the Bundesliga, playing for the Hungary national team and then becoming captain of his national team at an incredibly young age. feed ""These are proper positives and this is even before we even think about his qualities as a footballer. I will not say too much about them at this stage except they are definitely the kind which will hopefully bring a lot of enjoyment and also help us to get results. ""There is no pressure, though. Dominik is still a very young player. He has so much development ahead of him and this means it makes sense for us all to be patient and to give him the time and space to allow his talent to come through within our team. ""The good thing is we have supporters who understand this process. I know the fans are as excited as we are but I am also aware, because I have seen it many times already, that they will be a massive help to us in terms of creating the conditions that will allow Dominik to thrive. ""From the clubs he has been at, the leagues he has played in and the family he is part of, it is very clear that he has already had an outstanding football education, so our responsibility now is to continue this education with him as part of the Liverpool family. ""Everything about this is good news and I am very grateful to everyone at the club who has contributed to making it happen. This is a signing for our present and also for our future and the work that has gone into it could not be more appreciated."""

Jurrien Timber absent from Ajax training as Arsenal transfer nears,"Jul 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jurrien-timber-absent-ajax-training-arsenal-transfer-nears,"Jurrien Timber was absent from Ajaxâs first outdoor training session of the summer under new coach Maurice Steijn as his proposed Â£40m transfer to Arsenal nears completion. The Gunners reached an agreement with the Dutch giants last week over an initial Â£36m (â¬42m) fee topped up by a further Â£4m (â¬5m) in add-ons. Timber had been working individually at Ajaxâs training facility when he returned from holiday towards the end of last month. But Dutch outlet AD has reported that he wasnât present on Saturday when Steijn hosted his first group session of pre-season on the outdoor pitches. The same report further adds that Steijn and Ajax donât expect to see Timber back, given that his transfer to Arsenal is so close. feed 90min reported last week that personal terms between Timber and the Gunners are already agreed, with formal completion considered to be imminent â Arsenal are also in the final stages of wrapping up a British record Â£105m transfer for Declan Rice, having already announced Kai Havertz. The versatile Timber, who is expected to become the new starting right-back and mirror the inverted style of Oleksandr Zincehnko on the opposite flank, will boost an Arsenal defence that struggled in the final two months of last seasonâs Premier League title race and contributed to their slip-up in the title race. Leaking 11 goals in the space of four win-less gams in April blew the door wide open for Manchester City, who were responsible for scoring four of those, to surge through. Arsenal will also need better strength in depth when it comes to the Champions League, competing in European footballâs elite tournament for the first time in six years."
Girona left angered by Barcelona's Oriol Romeu approach,"Jul 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/girona-angered-barcelona-oriol-romeu-approach,"Girona have been left frustrated by Barcelona manager Xavi's contact with midfielder Oriol Romeu. Barcelona are on the hunt for a new defensive midfielder this summer following the departure of Sergio Busquets and are set to miss out on key target Marcelo Brozovic, who is close to swapping Inter for Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia. Reports in Spain have named 31-year-old Romeu, a La Masia graduate, as a possible target for Xavi and have even gone as far as to claim the Barcelona boss has personally reached out to Romeu about a summer return to Camp Nou. This contact from Xavi has upset those in charge at Girona, who released a short statement to SPORT urging the Barcelona boss to play by the rules. ""We know that Xavi has called our player and Oriol Romeu is not free, he has a contract with Girona until 2025, so we say that this cannot be done,"" the statement read. feed Romeu's contract with Girona is understood to contain a release clause of under â¬10m which, though affordable, could still be problematic for a Barcelona side keen to limit their spending while they get their finances back under control. The 31-year-old joined Barcelona's academy in 2004 and made two appearances for the first team during the 2010/11 campaign, before being snapped up by Chelsea in 2011. Various loans and a permanent switch to Southampton followed, with Romeu landing back in Spain with Girona last summer. The veteran was one of the top performers in Michel's side, attracting plenty of praise for playing some sensational football as Girona finished tenth in La Liga in their first season back in the top flight. Romeu has played his way on to Barcelona's radar and represents a cheaper alternative to Real Sociedad starlet Martin Zubimendi, whose release clause sits at â¬60m."

Pedro Porro responds to Harry Kane links to Real Madrid,"Jul 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/pedro-porro-responds-harry-kane-links-real-madrid,"Tottenham Hotspur wing-back Pedro Porro believes Harry Kane has the ability to play for any team in world football. 90min understands that Kane's representatives are beginning plans to push for a summer exit, with Bayern Munich, PSG and Real Madrid interested in the striker. Bayern have already seen one bid rejected by Spurs, who have denied that they have even received an offer but would reject any that came in. Kane has one year left to run on his contract. Porro, who joined Tottenham at the back-end of the January transfer window, has struck up a great on-pitch relationship with Kane, with each of the Spaniard's three Premier League assists so far coming for the England captain. In an interview with AS, Porro said of Kane: ""He is a leader, captain and reference. He has been offering great performance for many years, he has charisma and here he is an idol for the fans."" feed When asked if Kane was one of the top three forwards in world football, Porro replied: ""Of course. I wouldn't doubt it for a second. Very few forwards offer the work and defensive commitment that Harry gives [a lot], apart from his enormous quality and his scoring. He is a 'crack'. ""I have been in the team for a short time but long enough to realise how close he is with his teammates. From what I have spoken with him and what I have seen, I can say that he is also very great off the pitch."" Porro was then specifically asked if Kane had the quality to play for Real Madrid, answering: ""Great players like him adapt well to any situation. He has shown that he is a phenomenon. Besides, he already has a lot of experience. There's a reason he's the [vice] captain of Tottenham and the England team. A footballer always wants to have teammates like him by his side."""
Midfielders Newcastle should target instead of James Maddison,"Jul 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/midfielders-newcastle-should-target-instead-of-james-maddison,"Newcastle's Â£40m bid for James Maddison last summer was openly mocked by Leicester City. Then-manager Brendan Rodgers could barely contain a snigger as he said: ""It's not for me to put valuations on the players, it's not my side, but that might just cover three-quarters of his left leg, that price."" A year on, with Rodgers out of the door and the Foxes in the Championship, Maddison was sold for Â£40m. However, it was Tottenham that nabbed the English playmaker rather than Newcastle. With the club's first season of Champions League football in two decades looming, Newcastle have to bolster a squad that finished fourth last term despite a wobble in Spring. Here are some of the alternative midfielders Newcastle could target after Maddison's snub. feed Age: 18Club: Fenerbahce If the sudden craze around Arda Guler this summer has caught you by surprise, don't feel too bad - the toast of the transfer rumour mill has only made 20 club starts in his entire senior career. Nevertheless, in the limited game time he has been afforded for Fenerbahce, the wriggly left-footer (his father trained him to favour his left side as soon as he could walk) has emerged as one of Europe's brightest talents. Barcelona are hopeful of securing a deal for the 'Turkish Messi' with Real Madrid also interested. A rumoured release clause of Â£15m ensures that money is no object but Newcastle could offer Guler first-team football straight away, slotting into Howe's three-man midfield where Maddison would have played or as an alternative for Miguel Almiron on the right. Age: 21Club: Celta Vigo Across Spain's top flight, Gabri Veiga was the only midfielder to hit double digits for non-penalty goals. If Newcastle are to push on from last season's fourth-place finish, they will need to sharpen their cutting edge; five clubs, including Maddison's new team Tottenham, outscored the Magpies last term. While fans should not expect Veiga to necessarily replicate his scoring feats (the midfielder's 11 goals came from an xG of 6.1) he will offer another presence in the attacking third. Newcastle face fierce competition from Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City for the signature of a hot prospect that has a â¬40m release clause. Age: 25Club: Atalanta As a strong advocate against forcing young kids into routines of professional footballers from a young age, Teun Koopmeiners may not look too kindly at the prodigious acceleration of Guler and Veiga. At 25, the Atalanta midfielder is an option that offers an extra layer of maturity and security. Koopmeiners' former national team manager Louis van Gaal succinctly outlined his strengths: ""overview, insight and a good kicking technique."" A regular Liverpool target, Koopmeiners can play in any midfield role and has thrived in the exhaustive pressing system Gian PIero Gasperini employs at Atalanta. This grounding could help Koopmeiner limit the adaptation process which Eddie Howe's signings have been forced to undergo. Age: 22Club: Nice While he improves his ability to halt opposition surges, Khepren Thuram launches far more of his own as he regularly embarks upon barrelling runs right through the middle of the pitch. The 6'3 midfielder, whose father Lilian won the 1998 World Cup and his brother Marcus played in last year's final, is comfortable across a range of roles. At his best under Didier Digard at Nice, Thuram thrived in a side that had space to counter-attack into. Howe's set-up on Tyneside would suit him; only Manchester United launched more forward thrusts in transition than Newcastle last season. Age: 25Club: PSV Eindhoven Newcastle's failure to capture Maddison could prove to be a blessing in disguise. With the impending arrival of Sandro Tonali, Newcastle have already snagged an extra option as a number eight in Howe's 4-3-3. However, if the Magpies could lure Ibrahim Sangare away from PSV Eindhoven this summer, they would be able to unshackle Bruno Guimaraes from his defensive berth at the base of midfield. The towering Ivory Coast international has spent three years dominating the Eredivisie and signed a new contract with PSV last year. However, Sangare was reportedly unimpressed with the unexpected resignation of manager Ruud van Nistelrooy in May and could join him in the departure lounge if Newcastle make a compelling offer."
Levi Colwill eyeing Mauricio Pochettino talks before Chelsea contract decision,"Jul 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/levi-colwill-mauricio-pochettino-talks-chelsea-contract-decision,"Levi Colwill will hold talks with new Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino when he returns from England Under-21 duty as he seeks clarity on his future, 90min understands. The 20-year-old enjoyed an excellent loan spell with Brighton last season and has been the subject of enquiries from both Liverpool and Manchester City this summer, while the Seagulls are keen to bring Colwill back on a permanent basis. Chelsea, however, are adamant that Colwill will not be sold this summer. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Blues officials see the defender as an integral part of the squad and they are not prepared to even entertain the idea of losing Colwill. Liverpool returned with another enquiry about his availability in recent weeks but were swiftly knocked back. The 20-year-old remains under contract until 2025, with an additional 12-month extension clause to be triggered after a certain number of senior appearances, and so Chelsea are incredibly relaxed about the situation. Club officials are prepared to open talks over a new deal but Colwill wants certain assurances before making a decision. For Colwill, the biggest priority is regular minutes next season. The centre-back will speak to Pochettino upon his return to Cobham in search of guarantees over his role, and he is expected to be assured of his status as a key player. feed Colwill was invited to train with the senior England squad last month and admitted he will only get the chance to stay there permanently with regular minutes at club level. ""Going up and training with [England] is one thing, but I've got to keep up my performances next season. I need to play. I need to do well,"" Colwill confessed. ""There are so many things that come into you going back there. I don't think it's a case of, 'I'm close now, I might go up on the next camp'. I've got to keep playing, and playing well. That will be a big thing for me next season."" Chelsea, like the vast majority of fans, hold Colwill in very high regard but the defender himself believes the best is yet to come. ""I'm getting loads of praise but I'm still making mistakes that not everyone sees because I'm getting so much praise,"" he explained. ""I know I can be much better and have so much more to come."""

How can Arsenal afford extravagant summer spend?,"Jul 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/how-can-arsenal-afford-extravagant-summer-spend,"""We don't buy superstars,"" Arsene Wenger once triumphantly declared as Arsenal manager, ""we make them."" Mikel Arteta has adhered to many of the lessons he learned from Wenger over the years but the idea of holding back in the transfer market - which was an idealised view of Arsenal's approach in Wenger's latter years anyway - has not been one of them. Before the end of June, Arsenal had already agreed to transfers worth more than the rest of the division's outlay combined. While Liverpool have had to count the pennies in recent windows and even Todd Boehly's free-spending Chelsea have focused on outgoings before adding to their pile of lucrative assets, how have Arsenal been able to carry on buying superstars? Player Agreed fee Signed from Declan Rice Â£105m West Ham Kai Havertz Â£65m Chelsea Jurrien Timber Â£40.5m Ajax Kai Havertz was the first name officially through the door at Arsenal this summer. The club hijacked Kepa Arrizabalaga's wedding to shoot the announcement video which revealed a move from Chelsea worth up to Â£65m. After two rejected bids, Arsenal have belatedly agreed to West Ham's valuation of Declan Rice for a British record fee of Â£105m. The last time Arsenal broke the British transfer record, Dennis Bergkamp arrived in north London for just Â£7.5m. Bergkamp's compatriot Jurrien Timber is the third prong in Arsenal's onslaught of the summer market. Ajax have settled upon a package that could rise to Â£40.5m, taking Arsenal's total outlay to Â£210.5m before July. There have even been whispers of a potential bid for Southampton youngster Romeo Lavia. On top of the new arrivals, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale and Bukayo Saka have all penned hefty contract extensions this calendar year. William Saliba has agreed to a new four-year deal in principle as well. Wenger was originally one of the strongest advocates for Financial Fair Play (FFP) but became disillusioned by the idea when he deemed that the new rules had ""not been respected"" back in 2017. As recently as this year, both Manchester City and Everton have been accused of breaching the updated stipulations. Whether Wenger holds with them or not, the latest Premier League regulations state that no club is permitted to lose more than Â£105m across three consecutive seasons.  Last term's second-place finish may have stung but it did ensure that Arsenal qualified for the Champions League for the first time in six years. UEFA, naturally, have their own set of economic guidelines; namely, clubs are limited to spending no more than 90% of their revenue on staff wages and agent fees. This proportion is set to shrink each year, promoting more sustainable models across Europe's elite. feed Arsenal posted a loss of Â£107.3m at the end of the 2020/21 season and were in a deficit of Â£45.5m last term. Theoretically, the Gunners should have to make a profit of Â£47.8m this year to fall in line with the regulations but it isn't so straightforward - where's the fun in that? The 2020/21 season still falls under the bracket of a COVID-impacted campaign (only three of Arsenal's home matches had any fans in attendance) and all losses caused by the pandemic are overlooked by the Premier League's bean counters. Furthermore, Arsenal can write off any costs relating to infrastructure, the academy or the women's team. Not only is Arsenal's financial position far rosier than the top line numbers suggest, but the latest available set of accounts do not take into consideration the windfall set to flood the club's coffers. Should this be Arsenal's midfield next season? ðª pic.twitter.com/d5xbnn53r7 On top of the increased rewards earned by jumping from fifth to second in the Premier League last season, Arsenal are now entitled to a share of the Champions League spoils. The Gunners bowed out in the Europa League round of 16 to Sporting CP in March, raking in around Â£30m. The club are expected to make just as much - if not considerably more - just by qualifying for Europe's premier competition, with the bonuses from sponsors and baseline competition prize money guaranteed. Arsenal may have been extravagant with transfer fees in recent windows, but that flair has not extended to the wage bill. The Gunners spend less than half as much as Manchester City on player salaries each season. According to Capology, Arsenal only had the sixth highest wage bill in the division last term, comparable to Aston Villa and less than London rivals Chelsea and Tottenham - both of which failed to qualify for European competition.  This pay-check parsimony ensures that Arsenal are flying well below UEFA's revenue/wages threshold."

The two clubs did business late last month as James Maddison moved to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for a fee of around Â£40m, and Winks has now sealed his move in the opposite direction. ""Iâm delighted,"" Winks said after joining Leicester. ""Iâm really excited for the challenge ahead. Itâs an amazing club with great history and the facilities are incredible. Iâm just so happy to be here and ready to get going. ""Iâm looking forward to getting started, to have a full pre-season with the team and come here early to get ready for the games coming up. Itâs going to be an important few weeks to get everyone ready and to push myself getting fit.  ""Iâm also looking forward to a new challenge and to challenge myself. Coming to a club like Leicester is the perfect chance to do that."" feed A boyhood Tottenham fan, Winks came through the club's academy and went on to make 203 appearances for Spurs, chipping in with five goals and six assists. The 27-year-old even managed ten caps for England between 2017 and 2020 but lost his place in the international setup as he fell out of favour at club level. Winks started just nine Premier League games in the 2021/22 campaign and would join Serie A side Sampdoria on loan last summer. An ankle injury delayed his start in Italy but Winks became a core part of the Italian side's midfield. His loan to Sampdoria did include an option to buy which was not triggered after their relegation to Serie B, and now Winks has accepted a drop down to the Championship with Leicester."

They have now completed the signing of two 18-year-olds, midfielder Matos from Norwich and winger Moreira from Benfica. 90min reported in April that Moreira, a former target for Paris Saint-Germain, was closing in on a move to Chelsea and, following the expiry of his contract in Portugal, the teenage winger has now inked a deal at Cobham. feed Moreira, a Portugal Under-21 international, managed two appearances for the Benfica first team and has previously shone in the UEFA Youth League, notably bagging two assists in the 2021/22 final victory over Red Bull Salzburg. He is expected to join the Blues' academy setup alongside Matos, who began his career as a forward but gradually transitioned into a central midfielder towards the end of his time at Norwich. Chelsea had hoped to make a real statement with a move for Arsenal's Ethan Nwaneri, whose schoolboy deal with the Gunners expired at the end of June. An offer was made to the Premier League's youngest-ever player but Nwaneri has instead inked an extension with Arsenal."
Wilfried Zaha considering options after Crystal Palace contract expires,"Jul 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/wilfried-zaha-considering-options-crystal-palace-contract-expires,"Wilfried Zaha's Crystal Palace contract has now formally expired and the Ivorian is yet to decide on his next move, 90min understands. The 30-year-old, who came through the Palace academy and has spent all but 12 months of his career representing the Eagles, is now a free agent and has attracted interest from across the globe. Palace made an offer to Zaha in May which would see the Ivory Coast winger become the highest-paid player in their history and, although unsigned, 90min understands the proposal remains on the table. The Eagles are keen to retain Zaha, who has previously stressed his desire to play Champions League football. He does have the opportunity to play in Europe's top competition next season. Marseille and Lazio, of Ligue 1 and Serie A respectively, have both lodged offers to Zaha and can offer the European football he craves. feed However, Zaha has also been offered the chance to collect an enormous wage in Saudi Arabia. Thus far, Zaha has dismissed the advances from the Middle East but, like the contract from Palace, the offer has not yet been formally rejected or withdrawn and remains an option for the 30-year-old forward. There has previously been interest in Zaha from a number of the sides towards the top of the Premier League - Chelsea and Arsenal are known to have tracked the Ivorian in the past - but none have come forward with offers this summer. Zaha's decision to allow his Palace contract to expire will have a knock-on effect on former employers Manchester United, who negotiated a 25% sell-on clause when they sold the winger back in 2015."

The Reds had been keen to avoid triggering the clause, which must be paid in one lump sum, but informed Leipzig of their willingness to do so on Friday evening, just hours before it expired. With a deal now formally agreed between the two clubs, Liverpool are ready to put Szoboszlai through a medical this weekend with a view to making the Hungary international their second signing of the summer. Personal terms have already been agreed with the 22-year-old, who informed Leipzig of his desire to join Liverpool before the bid arrived. Sources close to Liverpool believe that, should all go according to plan, Szoboszlai's move to Anfield could be wrapped up in the coming days. feed Newcastle had been interested in signing Szoboszlai earlier in the window but instead turned their focus to Italian midfielder Sandro Tonali, who is set to move to St James' Park from AC Milan in a deal worth around Â£60m.

Inter send warning to Chelsea over Romelu Lukaku asking price,"Jul 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/inter-send-warning-chelsea-romelu-lukaku-asking-price,"Inter CEO Beppe Marotta has warned Chelsea that the Blues cannot demand a significant fee to part ways with striker Romelu Lukaku. Lukaku has just returned to Chelsea after his loan with Inter expired and all three parties are looking to strike an agreement which will see the Belgian remain with the Nerazzurri next year and beyond. Chelsea have rejected an offer of a straight loan from Inter and are instead pushing for a permanent sale this summer, although a compromise could be reached over a loan bid with an obligation for Inter to purchase Lukaku in 2024. Whatever happens, Chelsea are braced to take a huge loss on Lukaku, who cost Â£97.5m when he joined in 2021. ""For Lukaku, Chelsea will have to assess whether he is functional to their project: if he is not, their strategies change,"" Marotta told Sky Italia. ""It is clear that they cannot imagine putting him on the market and receiving significant offers. feed ""It is no coincidence that the possible sale to Saudi Arabia was around â¬50M. That can be a target that is very far from the â¬115M we asked for, and got, to sell him two years ago."" Lukaku managed 44 appearances for Chelsea during his first season back at Stamford Bridge, but contributed just 15 goals and made a bigger impact off the pitch as his unauthorised interview with Italian media, in which he professed his desire to return to Inter just months after leaving, saw Chelsea fans turn on the striker. He spent the past season on loan with Inter and Chelsea are ready to cut ties permanently this summer. The Blues tried to sell Lukaku to Saudi Arabia but he rejected an offer, stressing his desire to return to Inter. That stance has only increased Inter's desire to reunite with Lukaku but the Nerazzurri's financial concerns have complicated talks thus far. However, with everyone working towards the same goal, a compromise is expected to be reached soon."

Milner spent eight years at the club and racked up a cool 332 appearances, and he won't have to wait long for a reunion with Liverpool after inking a deal to join Brighton. Like Milner, Keita has also found himself a new club already. The Guinea international has returned to the Bundesliga with Werder Bremen, five years after leaving Germany for Anfield. feed Perhaps the most emotional departure of all is that of striker Roberto Firmino. Liverpool have already paid tribute to the Brazilian, who racked up 111 goals and 79 assists in 362 games for the Reds before embarking on a new adventure this summer. Nothing has been signed just yet but Firmino is a significant target for the Saudi Pro League and is expected to make the move to the Middle East. The Liverpool academy has also seen the departures of seven talents: Jack Bearne, Fidel O'Rourke, Iwan Roberts, Liam Hughes, Oscar Kelly, Charlie Hayes-Green and Oludare Olufunwa. Bearne is the only one of the group to have made an appearance for the senior side, coming off the bench in the FA Cup quarter-final against Aston Villa in 2019."

Chelsea close to Romelu Lukaku agreement with Inter as talks continue,"Jun 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-close-to-romelu-lukaku-agreement-inter-talks-continue,"Chelsea and Inter are approaching an agreement over striker Romelu Lukaku, 90min understands. Lukaku has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia and is adamant that he only wants to play for Inter next season - a stance which has only endeared him further to the Serie A side. Chelsea are happy to part ways with Lukaku this summer but have rejected Inter's attempts to secure another loan deal, with the Blues pushing for a commitment from Inter to purchase the striker outright. The stumbling block, however, has been Inter's precarious financial situation. The Nerazzurri do not currently have the money to fund a permanent transfer but are instead looking at a loan deal which would include an obligation to sign Lukaku next summer.

Jackson, 22, has joined Chelsea for a fee of around â¬37m and 90min understands the Blues have not yet ruled out adding another big-name striker, with Victor Osimhen of Napoli at the top of the wish list.

Liverpool agree deal to sign RB Leipzig midfielder Dominik Szoboszlai,"Jun 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-agree-deal-sign-rb-leipzig-midfielder-dominik-szoboszlai,"Liverpool have agreed a deal with RB Leipzig to sign Hungarian midfielder Dominik Szoboszlai, 90min understands. The Reds have been looking to bolster their midfield this summer and wasted little time in recruiting Alexis Mac Allister from Brighton, and now Szoboszlai appears set to follow him through the door. Szoboszlai's contract with Leipzig includes a release clause worth â¬70m (Â£60m) which expires at the end of June and sources have confirmed to 90min that, despite initial reluctance to do so, Liverpool have confirmed their intention to trigger that clause.

Talks over Szoboszlai have been kept separate to those involving Fabio Carvalho, who joined Leipzig on a season-long loan without an option to buy earlier on Friday. feed Szoboszlai enjoyed an excellent campaign for Leipzig last season, racking up ten goals and 13 assists   in all competitions. An attacking midfielder by trade, Szoboszlai spent the majority of the season playing on the wing for Leipzig, with most of his minutes coming on the right side of the team's attack. He is expected to return to a midfield role under Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, who was previously described by Szoboszlai as the 'best manager in the world'.

The academy graduate, who joined Chelsea at the age of eight, spent 19 years on the books at Stamford Bridge and managed a total of 155 appearances for the Blues in all competitions. A serious Achilles injury towards the end of the 2018/19 campaign derailed his long-awaited breakout season and, after a loan to Fulham in 2020/21, Loftus-Cheek would be restricted to a squad role for the remainder of his Chelsea career.

Why would Liverpool want Dominik Szoboszlai?,"Jun 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/why-would-liverpool-want-dominik-szoboszlai,"It is a summer of overhaul for Liverpool's midfield with a host of players departing the club and a whole lot of new ones needing to come in. James Milner, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Naby Keita and Fabio Carvalho will not be at the club next season, leaving the ageing trio of Fabinho, Jordan Henderson and Thiago Alcantara together with the youthful prospects Stefan Bajcetic and Harvey Elliott. Consequently, Liverpool have been linked with almost every single half-decent midfielder in Europe. They got the Alexis Mac Allister deal over the line very early and an agreement for RB Leipzig's Dominik Szoboszlai has gathered pace. Here's why Liverpool are so keen on plugging one of their holes in midfield with Szoboszlai. While there is a big desire to bring in a defensive midfielder, Liverpool clearly want to score a lot of goals from midfield next season. Mac Allister is attack-minded with a track record of finding the net and the same can be said for Szoboszlai. Szoboszlai scored ten goals from midfield for RB Leipzig in the 2022/23 season after making 48 appearances, showing both how important he is to the Bundesliga side and also how prolific he can be from the midfield. He also chipped in with 13 assists across all competitions.  The Red Bull graduate is incredibly technically gifted and he stands at a commanding 1.87 metres (6'1). He has the physical profile of a player who can transfer to the Premier League well and can be of use in both boxes. His passing range is excellent and even with a big fee, it could be a very smart piece of business. Across his whole career, Szoboszlai's output has been impressive; in just 226 games he has scored 64 times and provided 73 assists. Another major point in his favour is his incredible versatility, proving to be as comfortable on either flank as he is in the middle of the pitch. Club Appearances Goals Assists AKA Red Bull Salzburg U18 4 1 0 Red Bull Salzburg UEFA U19 6 1 6 FC Liefering 42 16 11 Red Bull Salzburg 83 26 34 RB Leipzig 91 20 22 feed 90min revealed Liverpool have entered advanced talks to sign Szoboszlai at the end of June. There was competition from Newcastle for the 22-year-old midfielder but that seems to have dissipated and he is the Reds' to lose at this stage.  In terms of the transfer fee, the release clause in Szoboszlai's contract means Liverpool will have to pay Â£60m. There are conflicting reports about whether that has expired, but regardless it shows the Merseysiders will have to part with a lot of money to ensure they get the Hungarian. 90min understands the club are confident they can haggle Leipzig down to Â£50m. The deal is separate from the negotiations that will see Carvalho spend a year on loan at Leipzig and the interest in the likes of Southampton's Romeo Lavia and Nice's Khephren Thuram is not expected to go away even if this deal is completed. Jurgen Klopp's side are also still looking at Celta Vigo's Gabri Veiga."
Man City determined to keep Riyad Mahrez despite Saudi Arabia offer,"Jun 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/riyad-mahrez-weighing-up-45m-a-year-offer-saudi-arabia,"Riyad Mahrez is considering a lucrative offer to join the Saudi Pro League, though Manchester City are prepared to block his exit this summer while they address the future of Bernardo Silva, 90min understands. The Algeria winger enjoyed spells as a key starter for City during their treble-winning 2022/23 season, but was scarcely used during the run-in. Sources have told 90min that Mahrez was left dejected and unhappy that he did not play a single minute during the FA Cup or Champions League finals. Silva completed both sets of 90 minutes in Mahrez's place, and the duo's futures are interconnected. 90min reported earlier in June that Silva had asked to leave City in search of a new challenge and the club will not stand in his way if an offer in the region of Â£75m comes in. PSG are believed to be preparing an offer for Silva, while he has his own suitors in Saudi Arabia. Due to Silva's likely exit, City are currently unwilling to sell Mahrez too, even though he does have an offer on the table. feed 90min understands that Saudi side Al Ahli have offered the 32-year-old a contract which would be worth Â£45m-a-year. Mahrez will make a firm decision on if he wants to leave City for Al Ahli in the coming days, aware that engineering an exit from the Etihad Stadium could be tricky this window. City have already lost club captain Ilkay Gundogan on a free transfer to Barcelona, while they are set to miss out on Declan Rice to Arsenal. Mateo Kovacic became their first signing of the summer on Tuesday, joining from Chelsea for a Â£25m fee."

Man City chief explains decision to withdraw from Declan Rice race,"Jun 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-city-chief-explains-decision-withdraw-declan-rice-race,"Manchester City chief executive Ferran Soriano has insisted the treble winners can afford to take their time in search of the right reinforcements and do not need to rush into deals like the signing of West Ham's Declan Rice. City saw a Â£90m bid rejected earlier this month and, with West Ham holding out for over Â£100m, subsequently withdrew from the race to sign Rice. With no competition left, Arsenal struck an agreement with West Ham to sign Rice in a Â£105m deal, eventually striking a compromise on a payment structure which satisfied the Europa Conference League winners. During the launch of a partnership with cryptocurrency exchange organisation OKX, Soriano insisted City are no longer at a point where they need to throw huge sums of money around. ""If you look at what we did at the start of this project, there was a need for a lot of changes and investment - but not anymore,"" the City chief said. ""If you look at what we have done in the last five years, our level of investment in new players is well thought out. feed ""We are not the top net-spenders of last year or the last three or five years. We have a platform where we know what to do and we can do it with time and intelligence. When we don't like a deal, we walk away and we don't panic. ""We are in a stable position at the top of the industry and where we need to stay. We've done this in the last ten years, why can't we do it in the next ten? Why not? That's our objective. To do that, we will continue to be humble and work very hard and try to have the best people and talent in our industry working for Manchester City."" With City declining to match Arsenal's proposal, Rice is now expected to head to the Emirates Stadium as part of a summer transfer spree which is set to exceed Â£200m. Kai Havertz has already sealed a Â£65m move from Chelsea and Arsenal have also agreed a fee of Â£40.5m for Ajax defender Jurrien Timber."
Ferran Torres resisting transfer talks with Aston Villa,"Jun 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ferran-torres-resisting-transfer-talks-aston-villa,"Barcelona winger Ferran Torres is not currently interested in a summer move to Aston Villa, sources have told 90min. Villa are looking to bolster their squad ahead of their return to European footballing having qualified for next season's Conference League. They are on the verge of completing a deal for centre-back Pau Torres, who worked under Unai Emery at Villarreal and was part of their Europa League-winning side of 2021. 90min reported earlier this week that Villa are set to miss out on Nico Williams, however, as he will sign a new contract at Athletic Club. They have since switched their attentions to former Manchester City wide-man Torres, with BarÃ§a open to a sale. 90min understands that Villa's talks with Barcelona have been productive and have progressed throughout the week, but the major stumbling block is Torres' reluctance to head to the West Midlands. Ansu Fati has similarly been linked with a move to England but is also resisting a transfer away from Catalonia. Reports in Spain suggest Barcelona are frustrated with the duo's unwillingness to leave. feed Speaking to Spanish media this week, Torres insisted he was focusing on his holidays ahead of returning to BarÃ§a for pre-season. ""Today, I am at BarÃ§a, but football takes many turns. I have the phone on airplane mode, on July 10 [the start of pre-season], I will open it,"" he said. ""I'm just focused on what's mine, training, taking advantage of the pre-season that I couldn't do last year [due to injury] and from here on, showing that I'm a great footballer. In the next few days you will have news."" Torres has failed to nail down a starting spot at Barcelona since signing from Manchester City back in January 2022. In 71 games for La Blaugrana, he's scored 14 goals and registered nine assists."
Luis Enrique to launch Bernardo Silva bid after PSG appointment,"Jun 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/luis-enrique-bernardo-silva-bid-after-psg-appointment,"Paris Saint-Germain are closing in on the appointment of Luis Enrique as their new manager, 90min understands, and the former Spain boss will make bidding for Manchester City's Bernardo Silva his first order of business. Current manager Christophe Galtier is expected to be dismissed imminently and a deal for Enrique, who was on the radars of both Chelsea and Tottenham earlier this summer, is close to being finalised. During Enrique's negotiations with the club, PSG's long-standing interest in Silva was discussed and sources have confirmed to 90min that the Spaniard has given the green light to a bid being launched for the City midfielder. Silva, who is understood to have a close relationship with PSG advisor Luis Campos from the pair's mutual time in Monaco, has confirmed to City that he wants to leave the club this summer and has attracted no shortage of interest. Barcelona have long been keen on Silva but are unlikely to be able to afford to meet City's Â£75m asking price, while an Â£80m-a-year offer has been made to the 28-year-old from Saudi Arabia. feed PSG are ready to launch a bid for Silva, who they see as an ideal replacement for Lionel Messi. Campos has already spoken with the City midfielder's entourage but it was made clear that Silva would not approve a move to Paris until a replacement for Galtier was in place. Now that Enrique is ready to take over, PSG will accelerate their pursuit of Silva, who already has 101 Ligue 1 appearances to his name and was part of the Monaco side that famously pipped PSG to the title in 2016/17. The offer from Saudi Arabia remains on the table for Silva but 90min understands he is not interested in leaving Europe at this point in his career. City will not stand in the way of an exit for Silva this summer, as is their stance with every wantaway player, but want fair compensation for an elite midfielder whose contract still has two years left to run."
Is Man City target Josko Gvardiol worth â¬100m?,"Jun 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/is-man-city-target-josko-gvardiol-worth-100m,"Josko Gvardiol is not an individual that can be easily shifted. Lionel Messi found a way of doing it but generally, the Croatian centre-back is in full control on and off the pitch. After breaking into Dinamo Zagreb's first team, Marcelo Bielsa's Leeds United launched a hefty bid for the precocious teenager in 2020. Gvardiol was under pressure from his own club to join the Yorkshire outfit but felt it was too soon in his development. Instead, he agreed a deal with RB Leipzig and stayed in Croatia for another season on loan. Chelsea reportedly tabled a â¬90m bid for Gvardiol last summer which the defender countered by signing a contract extension at Leipzig. However, Gvardiol has decided that this is the year to join the Premier League.  90min understands personal terms have been agreed with Manchester City but RB Leipzig are demanding a record-breaking â¬100m fee. Gvardiol knows his worth better than anyone but should City cough up such an eye-watering sum? Player Transfer fee Year signed Selling club Buying club Harry Maguire â¬87m 2019 Leicester Man Utd Matthijs de Ligt â¬85.5m 2019 Ajax Juventus Virgil van Dijk â¬84.7m 2018 Southampton Liverpool Wesley Fofana â¬80.4m 2022 Leicester Chelsea Lucas Hernandez â¬80m 2019 Atletico Madrid Bayern Munich Ruben Dias â¬71.6m 2020 Benfica Man City Achraf Hakimi â¬68m 2021 Inter PSG Matthijs de Ligt â¬67m 2022 Juventus Bayern Munich Marc Cucurella â¬65.3m 2022 Brighton Chelsea Joao Cancelo â¬65m 2019 Juventus Man City Data via Transfermarkt While their city neighbours hold the current record with the purchase of Harry Maguire in 2019, Manchester City are no strangers to splashing the cash on a defender. Of the 20 most expensive defensive transfers in history, City have signed six of them under Pep Guardiola. Aymeric Laporte and Joao Cancelo are expected to move on this summer while Benjamin Mendy's contract has expired and Kyle Walker has drawn admiring glances from Bayern Munich. Of City's dear half-dozen, only John Stones and Ruben Dias are sure of a spot in next season's squad. Virgil van Dijk briefly held the record of the world's most expensive defender before United were fleeced by Leicester City. Gvardiol idolised the Liverpool centre-back as a teenager and may well line up opposite him in the Premier League after the summer. Gvardiol emerged as City's top central defensive transfer target as early as April. In the wake of a hugely impressive World Cup - notwithstanding the runaround he was given by Messi in the semi-final - the initial asking price for the Croatia international was floated at around â¬87m.  However, that figure has since ballooned to â¬100m. City are adamant they will not crack nine digits and have already shown their willingness to walk away from negotiations this summer. Unlike the Declan Rice saga, where Arsenal's long-standing interest and eagerness made them favourites, City are the front runners in the race for Gvardiol. Chelsea haven't entirely given up hope of nabbing the 21-year-old and Real Madrid are also interested but Gvardiol is not the priority for either side. City are confident they can finalise a deal this summer, with the final fee likely to exceed Maguire's record sum but come in at under â¬100m. feed Laporte's impending Etihad exit is one of the reasons why City are so keen on signing Gvardiol, who would serve as a perfect replacement. Following the arrival of Laporte for a club-record Â£57m in 2018, Guardiola explained how a naturally left-footed centre-back opens up a raft of new passing angles out from the back. ""When you receive to go to the right, you have to go inside, because you want to go to the right foot,"" the manager outlined. ""In the left, you go to that side, so it helps us to create this build-up [to the left, and to the right with a diagonal pass]. With the right foot, it is a little bit more complicated."" Gvardiol's status ""as a left-footer"" was also flagged as a bonus upon his arrival at RB Leipzig by the then-sporting director Markus Krosche. What Gvardiol does to the ball with that trusty left foot is just as important. Playing for a transition-based RB Leipzig team for the past two years, Gvardiol explained: ""When I win the ball, my first objective is to look ahead and play the most vertical pass possible."" Even with this direct approach, Gvardiol still posted a creditable 89% pass accuracy last season. An innate sense of control helps Gvardiol keep his head amid the fury of a football match. ""I guess that calmness and composure I have on the pitch is something I was born with,"" he said. ""It comes naturally to me."" Gvardiol's coach at RB Leipzig concurred. ""Heâs incredibly mature for his age,"" Marco Rose reported, ""both on and off the ball."" To underline the range of skills at Gvardiol's disposal just four years after his senior debut, his former neighbour and youth team coach Vedran Peric argued: ""It's his heading that makes him special."" There is another debate entirely as to whether any footballer should ever be worth as much as â¬100m. However, based on the precedent set by previous transfers, that price tag would be value for money if Gvardiol rises above the rest of his peers. According to his national team manager Zlatko Dalic, he already has. ""The way he plays, with the grace he controls the ball, it's amazing,"" Dalic lauded last year. ""Gvardiol is the best central defender in the world."""
West Ham advancing talks to sign Harvey Barnes from Leicester,"Jun 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-advancing-talks-sign-harvey-barnes-leicester,"West Ham United are advancing talks with Leicester City over the signing of winger Harvey Barnes, 90min understands. The Hammers are looking to strengthen their squad after qualifying for this season's Europa League, courtesy of their first trophy success in 43 years. Declan Rice's imminent Â£105m move to Arsenal, which is only being held up by the finer details of how quickly the money will be paid, is expected to fund significant activity transfer in the window, with West Ham also looking for recruits in defence, midfield and attack. Sources have told 90min that West Ham's plans potentially include signing two wingers - the first of whom could be Barnes from recently relegated Leicester. The 25-year-old scored a career-best 13 Premier League goals last season but was unable to prevent Leicester from dropping into the second tier, just seven years after they famously lifted the title. Newcastle, Aston Villa and Tottenham have shown interest in Barnes but 90min understands that West Ham are advancing negotiations with Leicester over a move to London Stadium. Barnes' arrival would provide quality depth for David Moyes as he bids to improve on West Ham's disappointing Premier League performance last season - their victory in Europe was overshadowed by losing 20 of their 38 games en route to a 14th place finish. feed Leicester have already sold James Maddison to Tottenham Hotspur in a deal that could eventually be worth Â£45m, though West Ham will hope a move for Barnes, who has a single England international cap to his name, can be pushed through for less. The Hammers' other transfer targets could be determined by incoming technical director Tim Steidten, whose last role was in a similar capacity at Bayer Leverkusen. Currently, West Ham are showing an active interest in Ajax's Edson Alvarez - his move to Borussia Dortmund appears to be off after hitting a snag - but they are also tracking Joao Palhinha, Kalvin Phillips, Denis Zakaria and Amadou Onana as they ponder how to best replace Rice. In terms of outgoings, Roma are still hoping to push through a move for Italian striker Gianluca Scamacca after his difficult first season in England, but West Ham may be reluctant to sanction a move of any kind unless they are able to bring in further competition for Michail Antonio. Arsenal's Folarin Balogun is a player West Ham have made contact over, but he has significant interest in his services from a number of other Premier League teams, as well as from abroad."
Liverpool in advanced talks to sign Dominik Szoboszlai,"Jun 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-advanced-talks-sign-dominik-szoboszlai,"Liverpool are progressing in talks to sign Dominik Szoboszlai from RB Leipzig, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Reds are continuing their search for new midfielders this transfer window following a disappointing 2022/23 season. They have already signed Alexis Mac Allister from Brighton & Hove Albion and remain interested in Bayern Munich's Ryan Gravenberch. 90min reported earlier this week Liverpool had touched base with the representatives of Szoboszlai over a summer move. There was initial hesitance that a deal could be agreed with RB Leipzig due to his Â£60m release clause, but 90min understands talks have reached an advanced stage and Liverpool are hopeful of agreeing a fee closer to the Â£50m mark. feed Liverpool have a great relationship with clubs in the Red Bull network having completed various transfers in the past, including Naby Keita and Ibrahima Konate from Leipzig as well as Takumi Minamino from Salzburg. Fabio Carvalho's season-long loan move to RB Leipzig was confirmed on Friday. Discussions for this deal have been kept separate to those regarding Szoboszlai. Newcastle United had also expressed an interest in signing Szoboszlai after missing out on the signing of James Maddison, who has joined Tottenham Hotspur instead."
Hakim Ziyech's move to Saudi Arabia at risk of collapse,"Jun 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/hakim-ziyech-move-saudi-arabia-risk-of-collapse,"Hakim Ziyech's move to Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr is in danger due to a contractual issue, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Moroccan has been deemed surplus to requirements at Stamford Bridge for some time. He came close to joining PSG on an initial loan at the back-end of the January transfer window but the move fell through as the French champions didn't register him by the Ligue 1 deadline. 90min reported earlier in June that Ziyech had agreed terms on a three-year contract at Al Nassr, where he would become a teammate of Cristiano Ronaldo. However, after travelling to Saudi Arabia to finalise the deal, an issue arose during the winger's medical and Al Nassr tried to alter their contract offer. feed The two parties could not come to a new agreement, though 90min understands that Chelsea hope the issue can be resolved and are willing to lower their Â£8m asking price in order to push the deal through. Ziyech was set to be the third Chelsea player sold to the Saudi Pro League in the last week. Kalidou Koulibaly left for Al Hilal on Sunday, while Edouard Mendy's move to Al Ahli was confirmed on Wednesday. N'Golo Kante will officially join champions Al Ittihad when his contract expires on Saturday, with Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Mason Mount also nearing the Stamford Bridge exit door to join AC Milan and Manchester United respectively."
Joan Laporta confirms Barcelona looking to complete deal for Turkish wonderkid,"Jun 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/joan-laporta-barcelona-looking-complete-deal-turkish-wonderkid-arda-guler,"Barcelona president Joan Laporta has confirmed the club is looking to complete a deal for young Fenerbahce prospect Arda Guler. Dubbed the 'Turkish Messi', 18-year-old Guler grabbed four goals and three assists in 20 Super Lig appearances in 2022/23 as Fenerbahce finished second. He is said to have a â¬17.5m release clause and has been tracked by BarÃ§a's Clasico rivals Real Madrid as well as Arsenal and Newcastle. New sporting director Deco recently flew to Turkey for talks with Fenerbahce and Laporta has now revealed the deal should be given the sign-off from La Liga. He said to Esport3: ""Deco was in Istanbul, he says that [Guler] is a great talent. feed ""Now, La Liga allow us to carry out the operations that do not count for this year. Our scouting department was following him. We are trying to complete the deal."" Guler broke into Fenerbahce's first team set-up last season with three goals and three assists in the league and made his senior bow for Turkey in November 2022. He also netted his first international goal in a 2-0 Euro 2024 qualifier victory over Wales. BarÃ§a's prospects in the transfer market have been affected by off-field scandals and financial mismanagement in recent years. Laporta recently hit out at a 'campaign against BarÃ§a' over the Negreira case which lead to a ban from the Champions League. The arrival of Ilkay Gundogan has been confirmed after the midfielder's starring role in Manchester City's treble-winning campaign of 2022/23 while stalwarts Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba have departed."

Veiga, who turned 21 at the end of May, announced himself as one of Europe's top up-and-coming talents during the 2022/23 season, scoring 11 goals and adding four assists to help lead Celta to a mid-table La Liga finish. That form has attracted the attention of some of Europe's top clubs. 90min has long reported he is of interest to Barcelona and Real Madrid, while representatives of Premier League teams have watched him extensively in recent months. Veiga's contract contains a â¬40m release clause and Celta Vigo have been adamant that this needs to be triggered if the midfielder is to leave Balaidos this summer. 90min understands that Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Newcastle United have all indicated that they would be willing to meet this sum up front or pay a little extra if paid in instalments. The quartet have recently held talks with agent Zahavi regarding Veiga's future, while Marseille and Serie A holders Napoli have also registered an interest. feed Chelsea are on the lookout for a Mason Mount replacement having agreed to sell their academy graduate to Manchester United for an initial Â£55m. Liverpool have placed an emphasis on strengthening their midfield this summer, already recruiting Alexis Mac Allister from Brighton & Hove Albion, while Manchester City have brought in Mateo Kovacic but lost Ilkay Gundogan to Barcelona. After James Maddison prioritised a move to Tottenham, Newcastle are also in the transfer market for an attacking midfielder. The Magpies will soon wrap up the record signing of Sandro Tonali from Milan. Veiga is currently at the European Under-21 Championships with Spain.

Sources have now confirmed to 90min that a deal has been agreed for Torres, who also drew interest from Juventus and Bayern Munich, and he is set to ink a five-year contract to join his former manager at Villa Park.

Should all go to plan, he'll become Villa's second signing of the summer after Youri Tielemans joined on a free transfer from recently relegated Leicester City. feed The incomings are unlikely to stop there. 90min understands that Emery will be given an expansive budget this summer, with the former Arsenal and PSG boss having overseen a remarkable turnaround since taking charge at the club - Villa veered away from a relegation battle to qualify for the Conference League after finishing 7th in the Premier League. ""The club is working to improve also and to take all we need to improve and to do our way,"" Emery said last month.

He is expected to sign a five-year contract with an option for a further year. United had previously made three bids for Mount, all of which were rejected by Chelsea. The Blues countered United's last offer totalling Â£55m with a proposal for a deal worth Â£65m, and United had indicated at that point they were not willing to go above that offer. 90min however reported on Monday that Chelsea were willing to reduce their asking price to a fee which would total Â£60m, in order to facilitate the transfer. United have now met Chelsea's compromised meet-in-the-middle offer and the deal will move forward. manual Mount, about to enter the final year of his contract, has made clear to Chelsea he is not willing to extend his deal at Stamford Bridge, and that United are the club he wants to join. The likes of Arsenal and Liverpool were interested in signing the England international before his choice became clear. Erik ten Hag has been pushing for United to sign Mount for the entire summer so far, and the 24-year-old has been United's first choice midfield target. Chelsea, meanwhile, have had a prolific week of sales - offloading Kai Havertz to Arsenal on Wednesday and Mateo Kovacic to Manchester City on Tuesday, while they have also sold, or are in process of selling, a number of players to the Saudi Pro League. Ruben Loftus-Cheek is also close to joining Milan."
Most expensive English forwards ever,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/most-expensive-english-forwards-ever,"Here they are: the goal-getters, the match-winners and the masterful technicians down the flanks. While contemporary elite teams must press aggressively, build-up from the back efficiently, control contests and sustain attacks at will, the primitive aims of football have remained the same since its inception: you've got to score more goals than the other team to win. Many will argue there's no position in the game more important than the centre forward. While our concept of the position has become more abstract over time, this player's primary goal is to help his team put the ball in the back of the net as much as possible. These players hold a ton of value, with teams paying huge fees to ensure they snag reliability in front of goal. Here are the ten most expensive English forwards of all time - wingers included. Was there ever any doubt that Rooney would blossom into a superstar? No, absolutely not.After embarking on one of the biggest breakout campaigns at Euro 2004 that announced Wazza to the world stage, Rooney earned a move to English behemoths Manchester United for Â£27m.Upon his arrival, Sir Alex Ferguson described the bullish forward as the ""best young player this country has seen in the past 30 years"". Despite all the pressure and expectations, Rooney cemented himself as a Red Devil icon and he's regarded as one of the best forwards England has ever produced. Madueke somewhat got lost amid Todd Boehly's unprecedented cash influx during his first year of ownership. Chelsea prised the former Tottenham academy star away from PSV for Â£29m midway through the 2022/23 season.The Blues' woeful squad balance rendered Madueke's start to life at the Bridge tough, but he did impress on occasions and may well head into the Mauricio Pochettino era as a starter down Chelsea's right.However, many wonder just how high the young winger's ceiling actually is. Aston Villa smashed their transfer record to sign Watkins from Brentford after the striker came ever so close to guiding the Bees into the Premier League.Watkins has endured lean spells in the top flight but also enjoys runs where he looks like the most prolific forward in the division. After struggling towards the end of Steven Gerrard's tenure, Watkins was emboldened by Unai Emery's arrival and subsequently scored 11 goals in 12 league games.His purple patches are majestic. Convinced by Jose Mourinho to switch London for Rome, Tammy's overseas gamble immediately paid off as he enjoyed a stellar debut season in the Eternal City.The athletic forward swiftly established himself as a fan favourite among Romanisti after joining for Â£34m in 2021. He scored the most goals by an Englishman in a single season in 2021/22 as well as the most strikes by any Roma player during their debut campaign.The striker's second season didn't prove quite as fruitful, but he's still very much revered on Italian shores. One of the all-time Premier League flops.Carroll was brought in alongside some fella from Ajax called Luis Suarez and tasked with rejuvenating Liverpool's front line following the departure of Fernando Torres to Chelsea.The towering Geordie, however, had just one big night for the Reds as he scored six Premier League goals before departing after 18 torrid months. This was certainly a sizeable fee given Gordon's modest Premier League record, but cash is quite literally an object for the Newcastle owners and Gordon undoubtedly flashed some impressive talent during his time at Everton.He only played a bit-part role for the Magpies during his first few months at the club, but his minutes are expected to increase with the club poised to compete on both domestic and continental fronts. After evolving into a relentless output machine under Pep Guardiola, Sterling opted for pastures new in 2022 and signed for Thomas Tuchel's Chelsea.However, the situation in west London proved to be far more unstable than Sterling could've ever imagined and he ended up playing under four managers during his debut season. While we rarely saw the England international at his very best, he was one of Chelsea's better performers as he notched nine Premier League goal contributions.Brighter times lie ahead for Sterling under Pochettino. Him again.Sterling played a stellar supporting role for Liverpool in 2013/14 as 'SAS' took the division by storm. Daniel Sturridge and especially Luis Suarez took all the headlines during the club's title tilt while young Sterling was quietly making a name for himself.He joined Manchester City in 2015 much to the dismay of Liverpool supporters and after a difficult start in Manchester, Sterling came into his own under Pep Guardiola and will be remembered as one of the Premier League's all-time great wingers. A transfer saga that bored us all to death over several windows eventually culminated in Sancho joining United for just shy of Â£73m to much fanfare.After dazzling in the Bundesliga with Borussia Dortmund and establishing himself as an England international, Sancho was regarded as a talent who could take Man Utd to the next level.Unfortunately, though, that hasn't yet been the case. There have been glimpses, sure, but nowhere near enough. Although, many will claim he hasn't been put in the best position (literally at times) to thrive. His United record thus far is bitterly disappointing: 12 goals and six assists in 79 games."
West Ham handed Edson Alvarez boost after Borussia Dortmund twist,"Jun 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-handed-edson-alvarez-boost-borussia-dortmund-twist,"West Ham United have been handed an unexpected boost in their bid to sign Edson Alvarez after Borussia Dortmund's move for the Ajax defensive midfielder stalled, 90min understands. The 25-year-old had looked to be heading to the Bundesliga giants in a deal worth Â£30m - a fraction of the amount of money Dortmund agreed to sell Jude Bellingham to Real Madrid for earlier in June. The Mexican had expressed his interest in moving to Germany and went on the record to say that ""...this is what could make it the right time to take the next step in my career. But everything has to be perfect. I have to improve, but so do Ajax."" However, 90min understands that Dortmund's move for Alvarez has hit a snag and they are now making alternative transfer plans. Indeed, former Liverpool midfielder Emre Can is set to be offered a new contract and a move for Wolfsburg's Felix Nmecha is being lined up. That's opened the door for West Ham to re-enter the race for Alvarez, at a time when they are beginning to prepare for life after captain Declan Rice. Arsenal have agreed the structure of a Â£105m deal for the 24-year-old - a record transfer fee for a British player - and are now ironing out the finer details before a medical takes place. feed Alvarez, a defensive midfielder who can also play at centre-back, has long been admired by West Ham - he's also courted interest from Chelsea and Manchester United in the past - and there was previously an expectation that a bid would be put in by the Hammers to test Ajax's Â£40m valuation. West Ham are imminently set to welcome Tim Steidten as their new technical director, with his appointment likely to influence the club's transfer policy this summer Joao Palhinha and Kalvin Phillips are two players the club have near the top of their current target list, 90min understands, while interest is also held in Denis Zakaria, who spent last season on loan at Chelsea, and Amadou Onana. All four are viewed as attainable targets despite their varying market values. There's also an appetite to strengthen West Ham's Europa Conference League-winning squad with a new centre-back and wide forward - a number of players have been shortlisted both at home and abroad."

Arsenal wonderkid chooses contract extension over Chelsea or Man City move,"Jun 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-wonderkid-chooses-contract-extension-chelsea-man-city-move,"Ethan Nwaneri has rejected the advances of Chelsea to commit his long-term future to Arsenal, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 16-year-old is widely regarded as one of the finest young prospects in the country, with his first appearance for the Gunners - against Brentford in September last year - making him the youngest player in Premier League history at 15 years and 181 days old 90min reported in March that Chelsea were pushing hard to take Nwaneri to Stamford Bridge, as talks over a professional contract between the player and Arsenal hadn't yielded much progress. Manchester City and Manchester United were also monitoring developments from afar, though it was believed at the time that Chelsea were leading the race for his signature. However, sources have told 90min that negotiations between Arsenal and Nwaneri have progressed to the extent that an agreement is now in place. The teenager will sign scholarship terms at the Emirates Stadium, before putting pen to paper on a professional contract in March 2024, when he turns 17. feed His new deal is another boost for Arsenal, who are enjoying an exciting summer transfer window after finishing as runners-up to Manchester City in the Premier League last season.

Juventus & Dortmund join Premier League clubs interested in Daniel Jebbison,"Jun 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/juventus-dortmund-join-premier-league-clubs-interested-daniel-jebbison,"Some of Europeâs biggest clubs are ready to battle for theÂ signature Sheffield United starlet Daniel Jebbison, who is entering the final 12-months of his current deal, 90min understands. Juventus, Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen have been following Jebbison for some time and are now gearing up making a move for the 19-year-old forward. It is understood a number of clubs were watching him closely during the recent Under-20 World Cup, where he featured in three of Englandâs four games. There is also huge interest within the Premier League too, with Newcastle, Tottenham, Everton and Aston Villa also keeping close tabs on the situation. feed Jebbison is one a number of key players at Bramall Lane who have just a year left on their current deal. The clubâs issues in finding a new owner are hampering their plans to tie down players with Sander Berge and Iliman NâDiaye are also drawing major interest. Now, the Blades are set to face a huge battle to hang onto Jebbison, who could sign a pre-contract with an oversea club in little over six months' time. The teenage striker has come through Sheffield United's youth system after his family emigrated from Canada when he was 13.Â It wasn't long before Jebbison was soon making an impact at first-team level and became the youngest player in the Premier League history to score on his full debut, netting against Everton aged just 17 and 309 days."
Most expensive English goalkeepers ever,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/most-expensive-english-goalkeepers-ever,"Gordon Banks, Peter Shilton, David Seaman...England have had their fair share of stellar number ones over the years. Despite the apparent simplicity of the function, there might not be a position that's changed so drastically in recent years in terms of what's expected of a goalkeeper. The capacity to stop the ball from hitting the back of the net is no longer enough. Contemporary shot-stoppers, thanks to several revolutionaries, must be more than adept with their feet and act like a sweeper behind their defensive line. It's a tough job and England haven't been blessed with an array of world-leading goalkeepers in recent years. That's reflected by the modest transfer fees that constitute the ten most expensive English goalkeepers in history. The Man Utd academy graduate enjoyed a whopping ten loan spells over seven years before moving to West Brom for Â£5m in 2018.Johnstone had impressed on loan at Aston Villa in the second tier, but his stout form didn't quite permeate into his time at the Hawthorns. His first two seasons were mixed as the Baggies enjoyed success, returning to the Premier League in 2020.Fans questioned whether Johnstone should be the club's number one heading into their return campaign in the top flight, but the club retained their faith in the Englishman and he enjoyed an excellent season which saw him earn a call-up to Gareth Southgate's Euro 2020 squad. Before becoming everybody's favourite YouTuber and Ryan Reynolds' best mate, Foster was a consistently steady Premier League shot-stopper.His big break came at Man Utd, but it was with Watford where he first garnered plenty of plaudits. Foster earned a Â£6m move to Birmingham in 2010, but he'd spend just one year at the club following their relegation to the second tier. An excellent 2000/01 season with Coventry convinced Liverpool to make a 20-year-old Kirkland the most expensive British goalkeeper ever at the time.The Reds sent Â£6m Coventry's way, but Kirkland largely spent his debut season as Jerzy Dudek's understudy. He eventually broke into the team during his second season before injuries started to take their toll on the young shot-stopper.In the end, Kirkland spent five years at Liverpool (including two loan spells elsewhere) and made just 45 appearances for the club before departing for Wigan in 2006. Wright enjoyed a prosperous six-year spell at Ipswich and upon his arrival at Arsenal in 2001, Arsene Wenger believed he had signed David Seaman's long-term successor.However, Wenger's initial outlook couldn't have been more erroneous.Injuries to Seaman meant Wright was given ample opportunity to shine during his debut season, but frequent errors rendered his position at the club untenable and he left Highbury after just one year. Heaton was capable of producing some otherworldly performances during his impressive stint at Burnley's number one.The traditional and fundamentally sound shot-stopper earned an Â£8m move to the historically significant Aston Villa but he enjoyed just one campaign as the club's number one following Emiliano Martinez's arrival in 2020. You might not like the short sleeves, but such a unique (and wrong) aesthetic is yet to hinder Pope's competence between the sticks, especially at Newcastle.After succeeding Heaton at Burnley, Pope enjoyed several stout seasons at Turf Moor before joining an incredibly exciting project at St James' Park. The England international's debut season on Tyneside was excellent as he finished the campaign with the second-most clean sheets in the Premier League, while Newcastle boasted the joint-best defensive record in the division.Bargain. Forster forged a lofty reputation for his work at Celtic, earning a Â£10m move to Southampton.The towering keeper spent eight years on the south coast and made 134 Premier League appearances for the Saints. After starring initially, Forster endured several rough patches during his stint with the club and was usurped by Alex McCarthy as their number one towards the end of his tenure. Young Ramsdale impressed for Bournemouth during their miserable 2019/20 campaign and Sheffield United spent what was then the second-highest fee paid for any British goalkeeper in history to bring him home.Ramsdale had spent the latter stages of his youth career with the Blades, but his homecoming wasn't a prosperous one. While the keeper impressed on an individual level, his side were dismal and finished rock bottom in the Premier League table. While many laughed at Arsenal for paying Â£30m for a goalkeeper who had just suffered back-to-back relegations, Mikel Arteta certainly knew what he was doing.It didn't take long for Ramsdale to usurp Bernd Leno as Arsenal's number one given his profiency in possession and he's since emerged as one of the Premier League's very best goalkeepers. While he's not yet the finished project, Ramsdale has cemented himself as a fan favourite in north London and is a cornerstone of Arteta's project."
Where should Harry Kane go this summer?,"Jun 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/where-should-harry-kane-go-this-summer,"The Harry Kane transfer saga could have a few surprising twists and turns this summer. Tottenham Hotspur had informed their star striker that he would not be allowed to leave this window. Europe's top clubs initially expected Spurs to keep hold of him. But Bayern Munich have started to test the waters, submitting a â¬70m bid for Kane earlier this week. Tottenham denied that it even came in, but if it did it would be rejected out of hand. 90min understands Kane's camp have made Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain aware of developments. Spurs might not get the quiet summer they had been hoping for. So where should Kane go if he's afforded an exit this summer? Should he even leave at all? Let's assess his options. feed Pros: Can reunite with Mauricio PochettinoCons: Chelsea finished 12th and are a mess? Did everyone forget this? Chelsea's hiring of Tottenham legend Pochettino could throw the cat among the pigeons. 90min reported in April that Spurs were braced for the Blues to show an interest in Kane due to this appointment. But Pochettino took the Chelsea job because he couldn't stay unemployed forever. Kane won't have such a narrow choice of options if he decides to leave Tottenham and is aware of the implications it would have on his legacy. Pros: The existence of the EurostarCons: Moving here would be an admission that the trophy jibes get to him PSG are coming to the needed end of their superstar cycle. If any club is in need of a rebuild, it's them. Does it make sense for Kane to join such a project at this time, even if it came with the promise of winning a LEGACY ALTERING AND DEFINING Ligue 1 title? No. It probably makes even less sense on PSG's side. Pros: This is Manchester United Football Club we're talking aboutCons: This is Manchester United Football Club we're talking about The expectation among Spurs fans towards the start of Kane's rise was that if he were to leave, he would join the biggest club in the country. Man Utd are indeed interested in Kane and their fans chanted 'we'll see you in June' to the striker during their 2-2 draw at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium near the end of the 2022/23 season. But Daniel Levy's stance will likely make such a move impossible - he would prefer not to sell domestically and Man Utd would prefer simply not to talk to him. Pros: Guaranteed Bundesliga titlesCons: What are they really worth in modern-day currency? Bayern Munich have courted Kane for a year in belief they can convince him to join. It seems they have turned his head and part of the pitch is leading them to Champions League glory. That scans considering they've won 11 Bundesliga titles in a row and are probably using those famous spherical trophies to serve entrees at parties. But Bayern Munich are still Bayern Munich - it's a privilege alone to be their star player and starting striker. Pros: The biggest club in world footballCons: The looming presence of Kylian Mbappe Real Madrid have always admired Kane, and the sudden departure of Karim Benzema could see them advance their interest. The problem for Los Blancos is the possibility of signing Kylian Mbappe either this summer or next - can they really afford both if they're not free transfers? If heading to the Santiago Bernabeu is an option, then Kane should take it without hesitation. He may have to wait for that opening, however. Pros: Master of his own fateCons: A year's worth of intense media scrutiny If Kane is still in north London come September, it's likely the primary reason will be that Tottenham remained stern in their approach to bids. That should suit him. From January onwards, Kane would be in control of his destiny. He could speak to foreign clubs freely, get a little auction started, see if any other big-hitters make a play. Kane still has his sights set on breaking Alan Shearer's Premier League goal record later in his career. Staying at Spurs for one more season would help him chip away at that tally and take the pressure off returning to England in his prime, give him another opportunity to end the club's trophy drought without needing to focus on European competition. It's time for one last dance."
Most expensive English defenders ever,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/most-expensive-english-defenders-ever,"England may not be the relentless producers of supreme defensive talent that Italy once was, but they've had their fair share of stellar defenders. With almost every elite-level side incessant on playing out from the back and deploying aggressive defensive lines, the acquisition of defenders capable of performing such tasks has become a necessity. The modern-day demands combined with inflation has seen transfer fees for defenders sky rocket in recent years. Here are the ten most expensive English defenders ever. After shining on loan, Milan completed the Â£30m purchase of Tomori in the summer of 2021 before he embarked on the best season of his career during the Rossoneri's Scudetto win.Tomori's exceptional season made his permanent arrival worthwhile and the lack of interest from the national team has been curious.The former Chelsea man will be looking to rebound after enduring a down year in 2022/23. Keane was a sturdy figure for Sean Dyche's Burnley, and his form, which also resulted in 12 England caps, convinced Everton to spend Â£30m to bring him to Goodison Park.His steady form initially continued with the Toffees before declining after he penned a five-year extension in 2020. His belter against Tottenham during the backend of 2022/23 is his undisputed highlight in Everton colours. Man Utd broke the English transfer record to sign Leeds hotshot Ferdinand in 2002.United's Â£30m purchase meant the Englishman became the most expensive defender in history for the second time after losing his first title to Lillian Thuram in 2001.Sir Alex Ferguson had no doubts that Ferdinand would blossom into a superstar at Old Trafford, and the archetypal modern-day defender certainly didn't disappoint. Shaw has enjoyed quite the rollercoaster at Man Utd after joining the club as a precocious teenager from Southampton in 2014.The left-back has battled serious injuries and felt the wrath of Jose Mourinho during his time at the club, but he's emerged from the dark clouds and developed into one of the Premier League's best in his position.He's played a starring role for the national team in recent years, while the stellar form he's displayed for the Red Devils garnered him a new contract at the end of the 2022/23 season. Injuries have plagued his time at Chelsea, but there's no denying Chilwell's status as one of the most dynamic full-backs in the Premier League.He joined the Blues after breaking through at Leicester in the wake of their Premier League title triumph. Chelsea spent Â£45m to bring him to Stamford Bridge, where he's since lifted the Champions League.It's been a frustrating period for the England international, but he's set to become a pivotal figure under Mauricio Pochettino after extending his contract in April. Mauricio Pochettino converted the raw Walker into the most coveted full-back in the land and he made a Â£45m move to City after Tottenham's stellar 2016/17 season during which he starred as an up-and-down wing-back.Walker's evolution has been pretty remarkable under Pep Guardiola in Manchester and he'll be remembered as perhaps one of most under-appreciated full-backs of his generation.The Sheffield-born defender has won the lot at the Etihad. The 'Barnsley Beckenbauer' has come into his own after several difficult years at City, and he was instrumental in the club's treble triumph.Injuries and inconsistency for a long time undermined his time in Manchester, but he's emerged as one of Europe's very best defenders in recent years, excelling with the national team, too.Guardiola's utilisation of Stones in an utterly unique centre-back hybrid role kick-started their magical end to 2022/23. United's purchase of Crystal Palace defender Wan-Bissaka certainly raised a few eyebrows at the time and the concerns of many quickly manifested.While the right-back is arguably the best one-on-one defender in the game, his limitations on the ball are distinct (although he's certainly improved in this regard) and he hasn't lived up to his pretty hefty price tag.Wan-Bissaka has drifted in and out of the United starting XI since his arrival, with managers often deploying him as a specialist tasked with shutting down a particular opponent. White's rise from Newport County loanee to Â£50m man was swift. The confident defender shone in aggressive, proactive systems under Marcelo Bielsa at Leeds and Graham Potter at Brighton before Arsenal made their move ahead of the 2021/22 season.Athletic and technically proficient, White starred in north London during his first two seasons, with Mikel Arteta successfully converting him into a two-way full-back."
Mason Mount: Chelsea & Man Utd schedule further talks over transfer,"Jun 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/mason-mount-chelsea-man-utd-schedule-further-talks-transfer,"Chelsea and Manchester United will continue talks this week with a view to resolving the future of midfielder Mason Mount, 90min understands. United have already failed with three bids for the England international, the last of which was worth Â£55m, and they had threatened to walk away from the negotiating table if that offer was rejected. However, United left that offer on the table for Chelsea, who were originally demanding Â£70m to sell Mount. The Blues suggested a counter-proposal worth Â£65m but 90min understands a fee of Â£60m would get the job done. Further talks between the two clubs will be held imminently with a view to a compromise, with United still determined to lure Mount to Old Trafford this summer. United have made it clear that they will not bow to Chelsea's demands and predicted a drop in Mount's asking price, which has decreased Â£10m since talks were opened, but whether they will increase their third offer is unclear. feed United are concerned about paying over the odds for a player who is in the final year of his contract and believe their third proposal of Â£55m is more than fair considering Mount can leave for free in 12 months. Selling Mount before the end of the month would be significant for Chelsea, who have enjoyed an explosive start to the transfer window which has yielded well over Â£100m in sales already. The Blues are looking to balance the books ahead of the end of the current financial year after spending close to Â£600m on transfers over the past two windows. Kai Havertz has joined Arsenal for Â£65m and Mateo Kovacic's move to Manchester City has also earned Chelsea Â£25m, which Kalidou Koulibaly and Edouard Mendy have brought in around Â£30m with their moves to Saudi Arabia. Hakim Ziyech is expected to follow to the Middle East for under Â£10m, while Ruben Loftus-Cheek is close to joining AC Milan for Â£15m. That stream of income has strengthened Chelsea's stance in negotiations with United but there is hope from both sides that a compromise will be reached to send Mount to Old Trafford."
Real Madrid star's agent explains why Kylian Mbappe won't join this summer,"Jun 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/real-madrid-star-agent-why-kylian-mbappe-won-t-join-this-summer,"The agent of Real Madrid left-back Ferland Mendy believes that the club won't be able to add Kylian Mbappe to their squad this summer for financial reasons. 90min understands that Mbappe has told Paris Saint-Germain he will not sign a new contract beyond 2024, and the French champions do not intend to lose him for free next summer. PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has held talks with Mbappe's agent and mother, Fayza Lamari, regarding the club's transfer stance. In an interview with After Foot, the agent of France teammate Mendy, Yvan Le Mee, believes that Mbappe's refusal to appoint a representative from outside his family has cost him a move to Real Madrid. ""It's not her job, she doesn't have the ability to act. I wanted to start a restaurant but I don't know how to cook, so I didn't. For a moment, you just have to be in reality and do what you know how to do. To make arrangements for your son and other players, you should have a license,"" he said. ""I am convinced that if he had had an agent at the time of the negotiations with Real Madrid two years ago, he would have gone to Real Madrid. ""When you don't have the codes, when you don't have the uses and customs, when you talk to the leader of a historic club as if you were talking to someone you've known for a long time, maybe it doesn't work. You may not know how to handle the situation to get there. He's still in Paris and he obviously doesn't seem happy to be there."" feed Real Madrid retain their long-term interest in signing Mbappe, but Le Mee does not expect a move to go through this summer. ""It's a club that currently doesn't have the money for a transfer,"" he said of Real Madrid. ""Real Madrid cannot afford his salary, which is â¬40m net per year, plus the famous bonus of â¬30m net per year. He earns between â¬70m and â¬75m net, while Karim Benzema earned â¬13m."" Real Madrid's only natural number nine is now loanee Joselu. Harry Kane is also of interest to Los Blancos, but if they are unable to bring in another striker before the end of the window, reports in Spain claim that Carlo Ancelotti will use Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo as inverted forwards to compensate."

Should all add-ons be hit, the total fee could reach Â£45m â the recently relegated Foxes had been holding out for as much as Â£60m. Newcastle had also been in the race, but Maddison was keen on north London. Despite Leicesterâs struggles that culminated in a shock drop down to the Championship, Maddison impressed throughout the 2022/23 season. He recorded 10 Premier League goals and nine assists in 30 appearances and offers a skillset unmatched by any of his new Spurs teammates. feed The 26-year-old also played his way into the England squad, starting wins over Ukraine and Malta in March and June respectively, having previously made his debut back in 2019.

The Gunners had already seen two bids for Rice turned down, before submitting a third offer that totalled Â£105m. That blew a Â£90m package from Manchester City out of the water and saw the reigning Premier League and European champions pull out of the race. Although it hit their valuation of Rice, West Ham were not initially prepared to accept Arsenalâs bid as a result of the proposed payment structure â the Gunners were offering a guaranteed Â£100m spread over more than three years, but the Hammers wanted it in two. The total sum being offered was not the problem and it paved the way for negotiations to continue. manual However, 90min now understands that the structure of the transfer has been agreed. The exact payment dates must still be ironed out, but an agreement there is also very close. Arsenal, who finished second in the Premier League title race to Manchester City â having led the way for most of the season, has remained Riceâs preferred destination and personal terms have already been all but agreed for him to complete a move to the Emirates Stadium.

Barcelona actually have a first option that could be used, but they are set to not exercise their right to match Chelsea's offer. feed The 18-year-old, who is already a regular in the Santos squad with over 120 appearances to his name, is a Brazil international at Under-20 level. He can play across the front-line, but his normal position is as a right-sided forward. It is understood that Angelo will report to Chelsea for pre-season training, at which point it will be decided whether he is loaned out next season, or not. Chelsea have undertaken a process since the Todd Boehly led takeover to not just overhaul the first-team but also bring a glut of the world's best young talent to Stamford Bridge.

Jorginho & agent respond to Arsenal exit rumours,"Jun 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jorginho-agent-respond-arsenal-exit-rumours,"Arsenal midfielder Jorginho has insisted he remains 'very happy' with the Gunners amid rumours linking the Italy international with a summer move to Lazio. Jorginho joined Arsenal in January when he traded west for north London in a Â£12m transfer from Chelsea and quickly became an important squad player. The 31-year-old still has another season left on his contract, plus the option of a further 12 months until 2025. There is set to be increased competition should the Gunners wrap up a British record transfer for Declan Rice, but uncertainty surrounding both Thomas Partey and Granit Xhaka ensures an ongoing need for experience and options in the middle of the pitch.

Man Utd make contact with Brighton over Moises Caicedo transfer,"Jun 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-contact-brighton-moises-caicedo-transfer,"Manchester United and Brighton and Hove Albion have made contact over a potential transfer of Moises Caicedo to Old Trafford, sources close to both clubs have confirmed to 90min. Brighton's current asking price is understood to be Â£100m - similar in number to Declan Rice, who is close to joining Arsenal for Â£105m - though it's understood that is considered an overall figure rather than an up front payment. The asking price has risen recently as Brighton feel Caicedo is worthy of similar market value to the West Ham captain, given his Premier League proven quality and age. Caicedo is still only 21. United have been targeting a new central midfielder throughout the summer window so far, and have seen three bids rejected from Chelsea for Mason Mount. United made their latest bid last Friday totalling Â£55m, which Chelsea rejected. The two clubs are expected to speak again this week to decide whether to find a middle ground and complete the transfer. Erik ten Hag's side have so far indicated no willingness to improve on their last offer. feed Caicedo, who United had the option to sign for around Â£4m in January 2021 from his native Ecuador, is seen as an alternative to Mount, even while his cost would be far higher. Chelsea themselves have been considered as leading contenders to sign Caicedo for a number of weeks and hope to complete a deal for the player. Whether or not United are prepared to stump up the money required for Caicedo remains to be seen. Ten Hag would also like to sign a new centre-back in an ideal world, as well as a new striker to take the goalscoring burden away from Marcus Rashford. There's also a huge focus on who will be in goal for United next season, with David de Gea's future at Old Trafford looking increasingly uncertain. 90min revealed on Tuesday that a contract extension had previously been agreed with the Spaniard, only for the club to renege on their offer.  The 32-year-old could end up leaving for free to be replaced by Inter's Andre Onana, who previously worked under Ten Hag at Ajax before moving to Milan."
Barcelona & Real Madrid handed transfer boosts by La Liga,"Jun 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-real-madrid-handed-transfer-boosts-la-liga,"La Liga will ease transfer restrictions on Spanish clubs in the summer market, allowing teams to spend a little more freely this window. Strict financial regulations have been enforced over the last few years and La Liga clubs have been unable to make as many lavish signings as other sides across Europe. Barcelona were notably hit hard by these restrictions when they were forced to let Lionel Messi leave on a free transfer in 2021 as they could not register his new contract under new guidelines. However, MARCA report that La Liga are ready to ease these restrictions this summer. La Liga sides must ensure that the total cost of their squad does not exceed 70% of the club's total income. Teams currently over that salary limit are currently only allowed to spend 40% of money saved or accrued in player sales, but this figure will rise to 50%. This will then increase to 60% if the player accounts for 5% of the total value of the first-team squad. feed While this should allow the likes of Barcelona, who have been seriously hampered by financial woes recently, a little more room for manoeuvre in the transfer market, these rule changes are unlikely to help them immediately and they must still sell players in order to seriously benefit from them. Other sides such as Real Betis and Almeria - who 90min understands could sell star striker El Bilal Toure to Atalanta - have been hit hardest by La Liga's regulations of late and like Barcelona still need to bring in funds through player trading. Real Madrid, meanwhile, have still been able to spend lavish sums on players, recently signing Jude Bellingham from Borussia Dortmund for an initial â¬103m."

Spurs are on the hunt for at least one new centre-back this transfer window, ideally looking to bring in a player comfortable with playing on the left of defence. 90min revealed earlier in June that Manchester United's Harry Maguire, Manchester City's Aymeric Laporte and Wolves' Max Kilman were among their domestic targets. Their search has now spread to mainland Europe and Germany in particular, with sources telling 90min that they have opened talks with Wolfsburg regarding 22-year-old Van de Ven. He is currently away at the European Under-21 Championship with the Netherlands. Van de Ven has not been capped at senior level though made the preliminary squad for the 2022 World Cup. Van de Ven is a towering centre-back standing at 6'4 but has played at left-back during his two years at Wolfsburg. Liverpool also made enquiries about him earlier this year and maintain an interest. feed Tottenham are also still in discussions with fellow Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen regarding Edmond Tapsoba. 90min reported last week that Spurs were growing concerned with rival interest in the Burkina Faso international, with Liverpool, Manchester United and Newcastle United all keeping an eye on his situation. Spurs have made a busy start to the window having already completed the signing of Dejan Kulusevski on a permanent transfer and brought in Empoli goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario. 90min reported on Wednesday that they are close to wrapping up a deal for James Maddison after agreeing a fee with Leicester City.

Declan Rice potential shirt numbers at Arsenal,"Jun 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/declan-rice-potential-shirt-numbers-arsenal,"Arsenal fans rejoice! Declan Rice is getting closer to north London. The West Ham skipper has been a major summer target for several months and only the structure of a proposed British record deal following a Â£105m bid from the Gunners needs ironing out. Manchester City's withdrawal from the race was also a crucial domino to fall. It's a potentially transformative addition that'll undoubtedly raise expectations, and here's what shirt numbers Rice could wear for Arsenal once he joins the club. feed Declan Rice has exclusively worn the 41 shirt since he broke into the West Ham first-team. The digits have become so iconic for the Hammers in recent seasons that emerging youngster Keira Flannery wears the same shirt for the women's team because of him. Explaining why he's continued to stick with this number throughout his Hammers career, Rice told Gary Neville on The Overlap: ""When you're in the U23s, you've obviously got the first-team squad numbers and then it starts to get to the higher numbers when you're in the U23s. ""I was given 41, I remember when I went to Seattle on my first trip with the first team, I just got given 41 and you know what, it's stayed with me since."" For England, though, he's primarily worn the 4 shirt. Although, he's also donned 7, 16, 5, 17, 18, and 16 - the rules regarding shirt numbers at the international level are much more strict, especially at major tournaments.  While it is an unconventional number, Rice could stick with 41 at Arsenal. During that same interview with Neville, the 24-year-old said: ""To be honest with you, I've been having this conversation with my Dad, regardless of what happens in my career, I think I might stay with the 41."" The number was taken by Mauro Bandeira, an academy graduate, last season. Rice shouldn't have any trouble convincing the youngster to give it up."
Liverpool make contact with Dominik Szoboszlai over summer transfer,"Jun 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-make-contact-dominik-szoboszlai-rb-leipzig-summer-transfer,"Liverpool have initiated contact with the representatives of RB Leipzig's Dominik Szoboszlai regarding a summer transfer, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Reds have been scouring the market for midfielders after missing out on top target Jude Bellingham to Real Madrid. Aurelien Tchouameni had also been a target in 2022. They have already brought in Alexis Mac Allister from Brighton this window, with plans in place to bring in one or two more midfielders. Liverpool's search has led them to Szoboszlai. 90min understands they have touched base with the Hungarian's camp over a move and he has a mutual interest in completing a switch to Merseyside. Newcastle United have also registered an interest - they are set to lose out on another key midfield target in James Maddison to Tottenham Hotspur - while other top sides from across Europe are monitoring the 22-year-old's situation. feed The major stumbling block for any club looking to buy Szoboszlai is RB Leipzig's asking price, currently demanding that his release clause of â¬70m is paid in full. They are in no rush to sell one of their star assets. Interestingly, Liverpool have already agreed to send fellow number ten Fabio Carvalho on loan to RB Leipzig for the 2023/24 season. The 20-year-old failed to make a major impact in his first year at Liverpool after arriving from Fulham."
Man Utd coach confirms Erik ten Hag's interest in midfield target,"Jun 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-coach-confirms-erik-ten-hag-interest-midfield-target,"Manchester United coach Benni McCarthy has confirmed Erik ten Hag is interested in a midfield target currently playing in the Dutch Eredivisie. The Red Devils are on the hunt for reinforcements in the summer transfer window, though are yet to make a signing ahead of the 2023/24 season. 90min understands Man Utd have had three bids rejected by Chelsea for Mason Mount and are currently unwilling to meet their Â£60m asking price. They also retain an interest in Barcelona's Frenkie de Jong, who is now also being courted by Bayern Munich. While these sagas continue to rumble on, McCarthy has seemed to confirm reports that Man Utd have kept tabs on USA international Taylor Booth, who is currently at FC Utrecht in the Netherlands. feed In an interview with 947 Joburg in his native South Africa, McCarthy said Ten Hag asked his agent about Booth before bringing the former striker onto his coaching staff for the 2022/23 season. ""Erik ten Hag, the manager, came in and he spoke to my agent Rob Moore about one of the players that was playing in Holland. He asked Rob about an American player [Booth] that Rob also managed,"" he said. ""They were just speaking about that and once the conversation had ended, he asked him: 'By the way, how's Benni doing? Is he still working in South Africa?' ""He told him he's back in Scotland, said to Rob for me to give him a call and possibly if I could possibly come see him in Manchester. ""When Rob told me the manager wanted to come and see him, there was a massive lump in my throat. I called him, I spoke to him and he asked me to come down and deliver a training session."" Booth, who recently turned 22, has been capped twice by the USMNT and came through the ranks at Bayern Munich."
West Ham negotiating structure of Arsenal's Â£105m Declan Rice offer,"Jun 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-negotiating-structure-arsenal-105m-declan-rice-offer,"West Ham are not prepared to accept Arsenal's British record Â£105m bid for Declan Rice as it stands, sources have told 90min, but Manchester City will not bid again. Rice has been at the centre of a tug-of-war involving Premier League champions City, who announced the signing of Croatian midfielder Mateo Kovacic from Chelsea for an initial Â£25m fee on Tuesday. City had a Â£90m offer for Rice turned down by West Ham on Tuesday morning, comprised of Â£80m in guaranteed money plus Â£10m in add-ons, while Arsenal have already seen two bids rejected by the Hammers. 90min reported on Arsenal's third offer late on Tuesday night, which is a total package worth Â£105m to West Ham. That's a figure that would not only represent a club-record purchase but would be a new British transfer record, surpassing the Â£100m City paid Aston Villa for Jack Grealish in 2021. The deal would also make Rice the joint-fifth most expensive player of all time. But despite getting far closer to West Ham's valuation, 90min understands that the Europa Conference League winners do not believe the structure of the deal is right.  Arsenal are currently proposing to pay the Â£100m guaranteed over a period of more than three years,  whereas West Ham are expecting to receive all of the money by 2025. The amount itself isn't regarded as a problem, making an agreement possible if the Gunners are willing to move their timeframes forward. manual The good news for Arsenal is that Manchester City, who West Ham were expecting to return with an improved offer, have decided to back away from negotiations. They will now focus their efforts on replacing Ilkay Gundogan elsewhere - he joined Barcelona on a free transfer at the beginning of the week - and could resurrect their interest in long-standing target Gabri Veiga - he has a release clause at Celta Vigo worth around Â£35m. Manchester United had been lingering in the background for Rice, though it would have taken something extraordinary from the Red Devils to be able to stump up a viable financial package, and Chelsea have also shown strong interest before focusing on Brighton's Moises Caicedo. 90min understands that Arsenal has remained Rice's preferred destination, with personal terms all but agreed on a contract at the Emirates Stadium. Manager Mikel Arteta is also closing in on two other high-profile signings, Kai Havertz and Jurrien Timber, which will take the club's total summer spending north of Â£200m."

Arsenal make British record bid worth Â£105m for Declan Rice,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-make-british-record-bid-worth-105m-declan-rice,"Arsenal have made a third bid for West Ham United captain Declan Rice, sources have confirmed to 90min, worth a total of Â£105m. The deal, if accepted, would not only smash Arsenal's all-time transfer record, but become the British transfer record - surpassing what Manchester City paid Aston Villa for Jack Grealish in 2021. The Gunners have been leading the chase for Rice all summer, but have seen two bids rejected with the last worth up to Â£90m. West Ham have been demanding more than Â£100m for the duration of negotiations. Manchester City also lodged an offer worth Â£90m earlier on Tuesday, which was also rejected by West Ham. ThougH Arsenal have returned with a third offer and 90min understands they are hopeful that West Ham will accept. The offer on the table is worth Â£105m in total, with Â£100m guaranteed and an additional Â£5m in add-ons. Arsenal are working quickly to give Mikel Arteta the squad he needs to mount another title challenge in 2024 and they already close to securing deals for Chelsea's Kai Havertz and Ajax's Jurrien Timber, who between them are likely to cost over Â£100m. That figure could soon become north of Â£200m in a matter of days if West Ham accept the offer for Rice. Rice has already agreed personal terms with Arsenal, having made it clear to all parties that a move to the Emirates was his preferred move this summer."

Paris Saint-Germain confirm transfer stance to Kylian Mbappe,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/paris-saint-germain-confirm-transfer-stance-kylian-mbappe,"Paris Saint-Germain have made it clear to Kylian Mbappe that they do not want him to leave for nothing next summer, sources have told 90min. Mbappe confirmed to PSG earlier this month that the option of another year on his contract, which needs to be activated by July 31, will not be utilised, meaning he will be free to leave the club next summer on a free transfer. PSG were caught off-guard by Mbappe's declaration as their belief was that even if the player was to move, he would sign an extension and that would enable them to sell in 2024. However, PSG are now in a precarious position and realise that Mbappe could sign a pre-contract with another club in January. 90min understands that talks have taken place in recent days between PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi and Fayza Lamari - Mbappe's mother and agent. During the meeting, it is understood that Al-Khelaifi made clear the club's stance. If Mbappe is not prepared to sign a new deal, they will look to sell him this summer. feed PSG officials told Lamari that they do not want the issue to turn into a saga and they would like the situation resolved sooner rather than later, indicating their preference for a quick sale. Al-Khelaifi is anxious to avoid a toxic parting of ways and insists PSG will respect the decision of Mbappe, but they do not want to see him walking away for nothing. Lamari delieved the message to her son and now PSG are awaiting the response, but sources have told 90min that they are already drawing up the package they would demand to sell Mbappe - understood to be worth around â¬200m. It remains to be seen if anyone would be willing to part with that sort of fee for Mbappe, especially given he is a free agent in 12 months. Real Madrid, who unsuccessfully tried to sign Mbappe in 2021, remain interested and they do have a hole in their squad to fill after Karim Benzema's decision to move to Saudi Arabia.  However, with Harry Kane now agitating for a move away from Tottenham, officials are exploring all possible options this summer. They have also looked closely at Inter's Lauturo Martinez and Napoli's Victor Osimhen."
Diogo Costa offered to Chelsea & Man Utd amid Porto's FFP concerns,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/diogo-costa-chelsea-man-utd-porto-ffp-concerns,"Porto goalkeeper Diogo Costa has been offered to a number of suitors across the Premier League, 90min understands, with Chelsea and Manchester United among those contacted. Costa is seen as one of the game's top young goalkeepers and has long been watched by Europe's elite, many of whom are considering stepping up their pursuit this summer. Chelsea and United are both in the market for goalkeepers this summer - the Blues have agreed to sell Edouard Mendy to Al Ahli and are now looking for an alternative to Kepa Arrizabalaga, while the Red Devils are considering moving on from David de Gea, who is out of contract at the end of June, after months of negotiating a new deal. 90min revealed on Tuesday that United had reneged on a previous agreement with De Gea, which included a dramatic reduction in the Spaniard's wages, and there's now every chance that he'll leave Old Trafford once his current deal ends. Costa is a player admired by Chelsea and United and sources have confirmed to 90min that Porto have offered the 23-year-old to both amid continued uncertainty over their ability to comply with Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations. feed 90min revealed in March that Porto were aware of their financial difficulties - it's estimated that they need to raise Â£45m by June 30 - and the easiest way to receive significant funds would be to cash in on Costa. The Portugal international's contract contains a release clause worth around Â£65m, but Porto's need to do a deal could be scuppered by Chelsea and United having alternative targets. Chelsea have a long-standing interest in Inter goalkeeper Andre Onana, although they have concerns over his price tag, while AC Milan's Mike Maignan is another similarly expensive target. Valencia's Giorgi Mamardashvil has admirers at Stamford Bridge too, and would likely represent better value for money should the Blues choose to act. United are also in the mix for Onana and have held talks with Inter, while Brentford's David Raya is seen as a cheaper alternative despite Brentford's insistance that a deal for the 27-year-old will cost Â£40m. Onana appears to be Erik ten Hag's preferred choice at this time, however - the pair worked together at Ajax and the United boss has previously labelled him as a ""masterful goalkeeper""."
Ryan Gravenberch discusses Bayern Munich future amid Liverpool interest,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ryan-gravenberch-bayern-munich-future-liverpool-interest,"Ryan Gravenberch has revealed he expects to be at Bayern Munich for the 2023/24 season despite interest from the Premier League. The midfielder made the move from Ajax to the Allianz Arena last summer for a fee that could rise to â¬23m. Gravenberch was also the subject of interest from Manchester United, who are managed by his former manager from his time in Amsterdam, Erik ten Hag. But the 21-year-old struggled for regular minutes in his first season in Bavaria, making just three starts in the Bundesliga. 90min reported back in April that Gravenberch was unhappy with his situation at Bayern and had asked the club to consider letting him go if offers of first-team football came in. Liverpool are interested in signing Gravenberch and view him as a viable alternative to long-term target Jude Bellingham, who instead chose to sign for Real Madrid this summer. feed But speaking to Algemeen Dagblad, Gravenberch seemed resigned to staying at Bayern and insisted he now wants to make the move work. ""I assume that I will still play at Bayern next season. That's really how I feel about it. I am with a top three club in the world. I think that's beautiful and special. I'm not giving up easily. My goal is still to succeed at Bayern,"" he said. ""I have become more masculine and I think there is even more scope for that. It is incredible to see how players literally give everything here. Certainly other teams when they play against Bayern, as I was used to at Ajax. Players make much more ground here than in the Eredivisie."" Gravenberch is currently on duty with Netherlands at the European Under-21 Championship. Bayern, meanwhile, are interested in adding Harry Kane to their ranks this summer, though Tottenham have denied reports that they have received a bid for the striker."
"Harry Kane camp push for Spurs exit amid Bayern, Real Madrid & PSG interest","Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/harry-kane-spurs-exit-bayern-real-madrid-psg-interest,"Harry Kane's camp are agitating for a move away from Tottenham Hotspur, 90min understands, with Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain closely monitoring Bayern Munich's attempts to agree a fee for the England captain. The 29-year-old has just one year left to run on his contract in north London, though Spurs remain confident he can be persuaded to sign a new deal despite showing little inclination to do so. 90min previously reported that the general view from across Europe was that Kane, now the all-time record scorer for club and country, would stay put this summer due to Tottenham's point-blank refusal to do business. Bayern Munich have long identified Kane as one of their primary transfer targets, as they finally look to replace the guaranteed goals of Robert Lewandowski, while Real Madrid and PSG have been keeping a close eye on developments. Manchester United also have a long-standing interest in Kane but they haven't seen eye-to-eye with Spurs over their valuation, even though Erik ten Hag is desperate to bring a quality number nine in at Old Trafford. News broke on Tuesday of Bayern deciding to test the waters with a bid of around Â£60m for Kane, though sources close to Spurs told 90min that they had received no such offer. Even if a bid had been received, one in that range would be rejected out of hand anyway. Kane's representatives are understood to have stepped up talks with Bayern this month, and those discussions have given the Bundesliga champions a strong belief that they can pull off a move this summer. Indeed, 90min understands that Kane is again at the point where he's actively pushing for movement on his future, piquing the attention of both Real Madrid and PSG. feed Real Madrid particularly are taking an interest in Kane's situation having been rocked by the sudden departure of Ballon d'Or holder Karim Benzema to Saudi champions Al Ittihad. The Frenchman's exit has left Joselu, a recent loan signing from Espanyol, as Real's only recognised striker, causing somewhat of a split in the Santiago Bernabeu's corridors of power. Some key personnel want Real Madrid to pursue a move for Kane this summer and then move for Kylian Mbappe on a free next year, while others only want to bring in one of them. PSG, for context, are keen to sell Mbappe this summer to avoid losing him on a free transfer in 2024 - he has already confirmed he won't be extending his contract in the French capital. Agreeing personal terms would not be a problem for any of the aforementioned parties, with Kane accepting that a move abroad is unlikely to see his wages hit the heights of what top Premier League teams are able to offer. Whether Bayern are able to persuade Kane that a move to Germany is in his best interests remains to be seen, but they have backed away from other targets such as Randal Kolo Muani and Kai Havertz in a bid to provide Thomas Tuchel with the elite-level striker he craves."
Man Utd withdraw contract proposal for David de Gea & offer further reduced deal,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-withdraw-contract-proposal-david-de-gea-offer-further-reduced-deal,"David de Gea signed a new contract with Manchester United only for the club withdraw the offer before signing it themselves, 90min has learned. The Spanish goalkeeper, who has been at United for 12 seasons, has entered the final week of his existing deal with the club, and doubts have shrouded his long-term future for several months - with a drop off in form and a number of mistakes holding United back in numerous fixtures over the second half of last season. United issued De Gea with an offer worth around Â£200,000 per week - this a huge reduction from the Â£375,000 a week he is earning on his existing deal - and it's understood that De Gea chose to sign that contract. However, United removed that offer following De Gea signing his side of the terms, only to then issue an even further reduced contract proposal. Erik ten Hag is keen to make a series of upgrades to his squad over the course of this summer and next, with centre half, central midfield and centre forward all priorities to strengthen dependent on how many players United can move on in those positions. Goalkeeper is also a priority - though the profile of the player they sign in that position is dependent on De Gea's decision. Ten Hag is looking for a goalkeeper with appropriate distribution and passing abilities - areas De Gea evidently lacks - and sources believe he is pushing for a new first choice to be signed whether De Gea stays or not. feed 90min understands De Gea is still mulling over the new terms offered to him - they are not described as bad in any sense - and while there is still a chance he chooses to sign, the player is upset at the way the process has been handled. No decision has been made yet and while his contract expires on Friday, he does not need to rush a decision through regardless if he is still contracted or not. De Gea does have other offers, however, namely from Saudi Arabia - as 90min reported earlier in June. The 32-year-old was expected at the time to reject proposals from a league making a massive play to sign high-profile names, but United's withdrawal of their first offer and subsequent reduced follow-up has made the situation unclear. Karim Benzema, N'Golo Kante, Ruben Neves, Kalidou Koulibaly and Hakim Ziyech are all names who have joined Cristiano Ronaldo in moving to Saudi Arabia over the last few months. Many more are expected, with greater money on offer to these names than from anywhere else in Europe. De Gea would stand to make more than even his existing contract terms at United if he decides to move to Saudi Arabia, but no decisions have been made by the player at this point. Porto need to raise â¬50m before June 30 and could potentially sell Diogo Costa to close that figure this week - United and Premier League rivals Chelsea have shown interest in the past though his departure is not as advanced as reported in Portugal at present. Inter's Andre Onana is, however, the leading candidate to become the club's next number one should they sign one, 90min understands, and United have held talks about his signing. Onana worked with Ten Hag at Ajax and received wide praise for his performance in Inter's Champions League final defeat against Manchester City, and he is regarded to be one of the best players in the world in his position at playing out of his goal, distributing the ball and starting attacks. Ten Hag previously described the 27-year-old as a ""masterful goalkeeper""."
Man City confirm signing of Mateo Kovacic from Chelsea,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-city-confirm-signing-of-mateo-kovacic-from-chelsea-01h3ywhwjyq2,"Manchester City have confirmed the signing of midfielder Mateo Kovacic from Chelsea. Kovacic had just one year remaining on his contract at Stamford Bridge and was free to leave this summer, with City taking advantage and securing a deal which will cost the treble winners an initial Â£25m, with a further Â£5m in add-ons. The 29-year-old has signed a four-year contract at the Etihad and becomes City's first signing of the summer. ""This is a brilliant move for me, and I cannot wait to get started with City,"" said Kovacic, who will wear the number 8 shirt in Manchester. ""Anyone who has watched this team under Pep knows how good they are â for me, they are the best in the world.

Spurs made signing a new goalkeeper one of their top priorities for the summer transfer window and have moved quickly to bring in Vicario after a move for Brentford's David Raya stalled. Personal terms had been agreed with Raya but Spurs were unable to find an agreement with Brentford over their Â£40m asking price. Attention then shifted to Vicario, who was a target for Serie A sides Inter, Juventus and Roma, while Brighton and Manchester United also watched him during the 2022/23 season. Tottenham confirmed on Tuesday that Vicario's transfer is now complete, signing a five-year contract. feed ""We are delighted to announce the signing of Guglielmo Vicario from Empoli, subject to international clearance and a work permit,"" Spurs said in a statement.

Bayern Munich enquire about Frenkie de Jong - Man Utd retain interest,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-enquire-frenkie-de-jong-man-utd-interest,"Bayern Munich have enquired about Frenkie de Jong's availability as Barcelona's financial difficulties continue, 90min understands. The German champions are in the market for a new midfielder and have targeted West Ham's Declan Rice in recent weeks, though the player favours staying in the Premier League. Manchester City and Arsenal are currently in a bidding process for the player. Bayern have held interest in De Jong for some time and have touched base to assess the potential of a deal, with the Dutch midfielder a strong alternative. De Jong was also wanted by Chelsea last summer - when current Bayern coach Thomas Tuchel was in the Stamford Bridge hot seat. De Jong has been a long-term target for Erik ten Hag's Manchester United, who themselves are hoping to sign up to two midfielders for next season, and it's understood that they would be prepared to enter the mix to sign him dependent on availability - having targeted the 26-year-old through the entirety of last summer. United reached an agreement with Barcelona for the transfer to take place worth an overall â¬85m, but couldn't complete the deal due to an issue over millions of euros in deferred wages, which Barcelona owed to De Jong after he took a pay cut during the pandemic. 90min understands this problem has not yet been solved between the player's camp and the club. De Jong has always maintained publicly that he wanted to stay at Barcelona, and it remains the case that they are his dream club to play for. He established himself as a key player under Xavi last season as Barcelona won La Liga and is now established as one of the team's leaders. However, the departure of Sergio Busquets, and the replacement they choose to bring in, could still yet affect De Jong's future at some point in the summer. Barcelona are looking at signing Dani Parejo from Villarreal among other cheaper options, though Martin Zubimendi is a younger candidate and a natural fit for the pivot role that could be targeted dependent on player sales. feed Barcelona would need to raise cash to press forward with a deal for the Real Sociedad midfielder, and are looking to shift the likes of Franck Kessie, Ansu Fati and other unwanted players to raise money and give them room to maneouvre in the market. Should they not receive suitable bids for players they wish to sell, however, the club would likely consider substantial offers for established names - as evidenced with their acceptance of United's bid for De Jong last summer. 90min understands De Jong is a little worried about his playing time as Barcelona's search for a new holding midfielder to replace Busquets is live and fluid. They are expected to sign a cheaper and more experienced option to fill a gap in the squad but could yet sign a first choice dependent on circumstances. Alongside Zubimendi, Marcelo Brozovic of Inter has been targeted - though is considering an offer from Saudi Arabia - while Bayern's Joshua Kimmich's future is not yet decided amid public interest from Barcelona. Kimmich is well-liked by Xavi, who told Mundo Deportivo earlier in June that ""if there is an open door, there will be a negotiation with Bayern"" for a player he once called ""one of the best in the world"". ""What is clear is that we need a player of a very high level in that position, otherwise, it will be very difficult to compete next year,"" Xavi added on the position to Mundo. The potential arrival of Kimmich could spell difficulty for De Jong in terms of minutes at Barcelona, and would leave another hole in Bayern's midfield that they would look to fill. Ten Hag and United, dependent on De Jong's availability, are not expected to be far away from any deal for De Jong if a potential departure becomes a reality. Sources have indicated to 90min recently that the former Ajax midfield remains a player that Ten Hag ""adores"" and in an ideal world, he would still be the perfect midfielder for his project at Old Trafford. United have made three offers to Chelsea for Mason Mount and have pressed ahead with other players having failed in their attempts to sign De Jong last year. The club's takeover process - which has lasted seven months and counting - is not yet resolved, and has unquestionably hampered United's transfer activity so far this summer, much to the frustration of Ten Hag behind the scenes."

Adrien Rabiot confirms decision on Juventus future amid Man Utd interest,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/adrien-rabiot-confirms-decision-juventus-future-man-utd-interest,"Adrien Rabiot has signed a new one-year contract at Juventus, ending Manchester United's hopes of luring him to Old Trafford on a free transfer. The France international was first courted by the Red Devils last summer, but they could not reach an agreement on personal terms and he ended up staying at the Allianz Stadium. Rabiot then had his best season in a Bianconeri shirt to date, proving to be one of their more reliable performers in a campaign which was rocked by allegations of the club's financial mismanagement. His contract was due to expire at the end of June and Man Utd's interest was still lingering, with Juve in the dark until recently over his decision. feed But Rabiot has now put pen to paper on a new one-year contract in Turin. In a statement, Juventus said: ""Adrien renews until 30 June 2024 and is ready to experience more emotions with the black and white shirt. 177 appearances, 17 goals scored and three trophies won (a Scudetto, an Italian Cup and an Italian Super Cup): this is the loot accumulated up to now, destined to be enriched again. ""The story is not finished, we still have roads to go side by side and we are ready to continue running together towards our goals. Congratulations, Adrien!"""
West Ham could face battle to keep Lucas Paqueta,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-could-face-battle-to-keep-lucas-paqueta,"West Ham United may face a battle to keep Lucas Paqueta at London Stadium this summer amid emerging interest from Paris Saint-Germain, 90min understands. The 25-year-old was named in UEFA's Europa Conference League team of the tournament after helping to end West Ham's 43-year wait for a major trophy in early June. The Brazilian set up Jarrod Bowen's stoppage-time winner against Fiorentina, sparking wild celebrations in Prague as the Hammers won the game 2-1. Paqueta became West Ham's record signing last summer, moving to the club from Lyon in a deal worth Â£50m with additional add-ons, and has established himself as a firm fans' favourite after growing in stature during the 2022/23 season. The Brazilian needed some time to adjust to pace of the Premier League but turned in a number of impressive performance during the second half of the campaign, playing a pivotal role as West Ham not only warded off the threat of relegation but also steamrolled to unexpected European success. West Ham will play in next season's Europa League as a result, though their preparations for the new season have been rocked by Arsenal and Manchester City's very public pursuit of Declan Rice. The 24-year-old is expected to leave London Stadium this summer to further his career ambitions, but the club's Â£100m asking price is yet to be met despite a number of bids being made. And West Ham may have another problem on their hands if Ligue 1 giants PSG decide to follow up on their interest in Paqueta. Sources have confirmed to 90min that the former Champions League finalists are keeping tabs on his situation, knowing the player has recently changed representatives. feed 90min has learned that Paqueta wasn't overly enthused by West Ham's performances in the Premier League last season, which saw the club lose 20 of the 38 games they played to finish 14th. There are also concerns within Paqueta's camp over whether David Moyes' style suits his game and plays to his strengths - the Scot often asks his defensive line to sit deep and absorb pressure before looking to hit opposition teams on the counter. Paqueta's change of agent doesn't necessarily point to a desire to leave the club, but certainly raises eyebrows over whether he's considering his long-term future in east London. He remains a regular starter in the Brazil national team and was previously a target for Arsenal and Newcastle prior to joining West Ham. West Ham are unlikely to entertain any bids that come in for Paqueta, with their focus firmly on replacing Rice in the centre of midfield. Fulham's Joao Palhinha and Manchester City's Kalvin Phillips are two players firmly on the club's radar, while there's also interest in former Chelsea loanee Denis Zakaria and a long-term admiration for Everton's Amadou Onana. A number of other midfield options both at home and abroad are also being considered."
Sadio Mane makes decision on Saudi Pro League transfer,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/sadio-mane-decision-saudi-pro-league-transfer,"Bayern Munich forward Sadio Mane has made a decision on his future following interest from the Saudi Pro League, 90min understands. Mane traded Liverpool for Bayern last summer and endured a troubling campaign as he struggled for form and ended up getting suspended by the club in April after a bust-up with Leroy Sane. The Senegal international was often used in a central role to compensate for the sale of Robert Lewandowski to Barcelona, but managed only seven Bundesliga goals, missed a chunk of the season with a leg injury and didn't start any of the final three league games as Bayern snatched the title. Mane could be forgiven for wanting a swift exit and a fresh start elsewhere, but he won't be following Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and former Liverpool teammate Roberto Firmino to Saudi Arabia. feed The 31-year-old had been a target for the Saudi Pro League as it seeks to rival European football's established elite by poaching high profile names - albeit predominantly ageing ones. However, 90min understands that Mane is not even engaging with proposed talks and has no ambition to move to Saudi Arabia at this time. Bayern are hoping to recruit at the top end of the pitch going into 2023/24. The 11-time back-to-back Bundesliga champions have shown interest in France international Randal Kolo Muani, but have made an offer totalling â¬70m for Tottenham striker Harry Kane - although Spurs have denied receiving it and are adamant that such a bid would be rejected anyway. Landing a new 'number nine' could actually be a boost for Mane if it means being able to more consistently play in his favoured position wide on the left."
Roberto Firmino agrees Saudi Pro League deal,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/roberto-firmino-agrees-saudi-pro-league-deal,"Ex-Liverpool forward Roberto Firmino is on the cusp of joining his next club after becoming the latest player to agree a deal to move to Saudi Arabia, 90min understands. Firmino departed Liverpool after eight years and six major trophies at the end of the 2022/23 season, with his contract due to expire this month. The Brazilian, who scored 111 goals in 362 appearances and has been hailed for his impact by both Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane in recent days, explained his decision to move on was motivated by the âcycleâ coming to an end and it feeling the right time to do so. Jurgen Klopp had wanted Firmino to stay at Anfield, declaring in January: ""I want to keep him"". The Liverpool boss later admitted his 'surprise' when the forward communicated he was ready to leave. 90min understands that Firmino will now be one of the next big names to take his career to the Saudi Pro League, following in the footsteps of Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and NâGolo Kante. feed The 31-year-old has agreed terms on a three-year contract that will take him to within a few months of his 35th birthday in 2026. He is set to join Al-Ahli, one of the league's four leading clubs controlled by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), who also own a controlling stake in Newcastle."
Tottenham deny receiving Harry Kane bid from Bayern Munich,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-opening-bid-harry-kane,"Tottenham have denied receiving an opening bid from Bayern Munich for striker Harry Kane and have no intention of selling this summer, sources have told 90min. Bayern ended up not directly replacing Robert Lewandowski last summer when he was sold to Barcelona and have continued to keep tabs on Kane, who is about to enter the 12 months of the six-year contract he signed back in June 2018. 90min understands that Real Madrid are keeping an eye on Kaneâs situation, having seen Karim Benzema opt to join Al Ittihad in the Saudi Pro League. Manchester United are also interested in the striker but have backed away from anything formal in the belief that Spurs will refuse to sell. Paris Saint-Germain have additionally shown interest, with Spurs also expecting attention to come from big-spending fierce London rivals Chelsea. feed Bayern are the first club to put forward a bid for Kane, who turns 30 next month. 90min understands it is a Â£60m (â¬70m) package that includes add-ons, although Spurs have denied receiving a bid and are adamant any such offer would be rejected anyway. Crucially, from their perspective, chairman Daniel Levy does not want to sell and remains convinced he can persuade Kane to stay. Indeed, the belief across Europe in recent months has been that Kane wonât be sold this summer, although Bayern are at least testing the waters with regard to that theory. Kane has been informed that Spurs arenât prepared to entertain bids, despite being no closer to agreeing a new contract. But there remains a belief at the club that he could sign a fresh deal. Kane was back to his best for Tottenham in 2022/23, scoring 30 Premier League goals to equal his best ever league haul, with only a record-breaking campaign from Manchester Cityâs Erling Haaland denying the England captain a record-equalling fourth Golden Boot."
Arsenal close to Jurrien Timber deal after Ajax lower asking price,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-close-jurrien-timber-deal-ajax-lower-asking-price,"Arsenal are edging closer to the signing of Jurrien Timber from Ajax, sources have told 90min. The Gunners have made the Netherlands international one of their top targets for the summer transfer window. They view Timber, a right-footed centre-back that has played all across the backline and in midfield in the past, as a potential parallel to Oleksandr Zinchenko, who begins matches at left-back but tucks in centrally higher up the pitch. 90min reported last week that Arsenal had made an opening â¬35m offer for Timber, but this fell well short of Ajax's â¬60m asking price. Despite this large gap in valuations, the Gunners remained confident that they would come to an agreement with Ajax. And 90min understands that the Dutch side have dropped their asking price down to â¬50m, which is close to Arsenal's new bid worth â¬48m. feed Personal terms have already been agreed with Timber and there is growing expectation that a transfer could be finalised before the weekend. He was previously a target for Manchester United, who are managed by former Ajax boss Erik ten Hag. The Red Devils pursued a transfer for the defender last summer but couldn't get a deal over the line, instead focusing on the signing of Lisandro Martinez. Timber is in line to become Arsenal's second signing of the summer, following on from Kai Havertz, whose move across London from Chelsea is imminent. Arsenal are also expected to make a new offer for Declan Rice after West Ham knocked back their first two bids. Manchester City have similarly had an approach turned down."
Why a Takesufa Kubo transfer could be worth â¬30m to Real Madrid,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/takesufa-kubo-transfer-could-be-worth-30m-real-madrid,"Real Madrid sold Takefusa Kubo to Real Sociedad last year for just â¬7.5m, but they could still end up with a huge pay day for the Japan international if he is sold on in a big money deal. Los Blancos looked to have pulled off the ultimate coup when they brought Kubo back to Spain in 2019, four years after he had been forced to leave Barcelonaâs youth ranks over a breach of FIFAâs regulations on signing minors. Yet a string of loans to Mallorca, Villarreal, Getafe and Mallorca again failed to translate into a first-team opportunity with Real, having also fallen foul of La Ligaâs cap on non-EU players, and he left in 2022 without making a senior appearance. Real Sociedad were the beneficiaries of that, showing face in Kubo and watching him flourish. He was a regular starter for the club in both La Liga and the Europa League, finishing the season with 44 appearances in all competitions, nine goals â all of which came in La Liga, and nine assists. feed As a team, La Real had an outstanding season and finished fourth in the final standings to book a place in the Champions League for the first time in 10 years. It was first-hand evidence that Kubo could play an important role in a competitive team near the top of the table. His performances for La Real have unsurprisingly led to rumours of a possible transfer. Napoli are one such club reported by Italian media to be interested, having already experienced success in recent years with wingers like Hirving Lozano and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. When Kubo joined La Real, the mandatory release clause in his contract was set at â¬60m. SPORT has reported that the Basque club do not intend to settle for anything less should offers come in, the reason being that Real Madrid hold a sell-on clause worth 50%. Given that half of they could receive in a Kubo transfer contractually has to be passed on, it is logical for La Real to demand the highest possible price. But if they do manage to sell for the full â¬60m, it could be a big boost for those in Madrid, with â¬30m a substantial boost to the budget after losing Karim Benzema, Marco Asensio and Mariano Diaz as free agents, and releasing Eden Hazard."
Ange Postecoglou pushing for Tottenham to complete James Maddison deal,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ange-postecoglou-pushing-tottenham-complete-james-maddison-deal,"Tottenham Hotspur head coach Ange Postecoglou is desperate for James Maddison to join the club this summer, sources have told 90min. Spurs are hoping to bring in several new players this transfer window. Dejan Kulusevski has completed a permanent move from Juventus following his initial loan spell, while goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario is on the verge of joining from Empoli. Next up on their agenda is Maddison, who has one year left to run on his contract at Leicester City. The Foxes were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 2022/23 season and had set a Â£60m price tag on the England international. However, 90min understands that Leicester are willing to slightly lower this figure, while Tottenham are set to make a firm offer of Â£40m plus add-ons. feed Spurs' squad is currently without a player of Maddison's creative and technical profile, which is a problem they are trying to address given new head coach Postecoglou's desire to play a possession-based brand of football. Sources have confirmed to 90min that the Australian had hoped Maddison was going to be their first signing of the summer, with Tottenham working hard to now find an agreement with Leicester and personal terms expected to be thrashed out with relative ease. Maddison has been a long-term target for Tottenham, dating back to his days as a Coventry City player in the mid-2010s. Newcastle United are also interested in Maddison but as of yet have not made a concrete bid of their own. The Magpies are closing in on the blockbuster signing of Sandro Tonali, while they are in talks with Southampton over full-back Tino Livramento."

West Ham reject Manchester City bid for Declan Rice,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-reject-manchester-city-bid-declan-rice,"West Ham United have rejected Manchester City's offer worth Â£90m for Declan Rice, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Premier League champions formalised their interest in the 24-year-old with a bid on Monday night, comprised of Â£80m in guaranteed money and Â£10m in achievable performance related add-ons. City's bid was the same value as Arsenal's second offer for Rice which was rejected by West Ham last week. The Gunners had offered Â£75m up front and Â£15m in add-ons but had proposed to structure the payments over a number of years. West Ham have been steadfast in their Â£100m valuation of Rice, who they have accepted wants to move on and compete in the Champions League, and 90min understands that City's bid was swiftly rejected. The Hammers also hope the offer will now spark a bidding war between interested parties. feed Arsenal are expected to return to the negotiating with a third offer and are acutely aware that West Ham have been left frustrated by the bids they have received so far. Nevertheless, Rice remains their number one transfer target and is known to have a friendly relationship with manager Mikel Arteta. Manchester United also hold a significant interest in Rice and are considering whether or not to make a bid. Neighbourhood rivals City, meanwhile, likely see the West Ham captain as a quality replacement for Ilkay Gundogan, who joined Barcelona on a free transfer on Monday after seven hugely successful seasons at the Etihad Stadium, and could return with an improved offer. The treble winners are also close to signing Mateo Kovacic from Premier League rivals Chelsea, in a deal that will be worth around Â£30m."
Newcastle hold talks with Southampton over Tino Livramento,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/newcastle-hold-talks-southampton-tino-livramento,"Newcastle United have started working on deals to sign defenders this summer and are looking to land a full-back and centre-half, 90min understands. Newcastle are wasted little time in pursuing midfield and attacking options this transfer window, with Milan's Sandro Tonali set to sign and talks ongoing with Leicester over James Maddison. But defensive reinforcements have always been high on their agenda. They want a new right-sided centre-half to compete with Fabian Schar, while another full-back is wanted as well. A left-back was ideally the target but Newcastle are now looking at players who can fill in on either side. 90min understands that has led them to Southampton, where talks have taken place over both Kyle Walker-Peters and Tino Livramento. Both are on the market following the Saints' relegation from the Premier League, but it is understood that Newcastle are pushing harder for 20-year-old Livramento. Newcastle are believed to have entered talks valuing him at around Â£15m, but sources have told 90min that Southampton are looking at closer to Â£30m for the former Chelsea man. feed In terms of centre-backs, 90min understandsÂ that Newcastle are looking closely at Crystal Palace pair MarcÂ Guehi and Joachim Andersen. England international Guehi has shone for Palace since joining from Chelsea, although an asking price of over Â£50m means a deal this summer for Newcastle looks tough given the number of positions they are looking to improve upon. Andersenâs price tag is more likely to be less than Â£30m and it is believed he is a more realistic target for Newcastle at this stage, although the Magpies are still looking at numerous options."
Manchester City table bid for West Ham captain Declan Rice,"Jun 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/manchester-city-bid-west-ham-captain-declan-rice,"Manchester City have made their first official bid for West Ham United captain Declan Rice, 90min understands. The Premier League champions have been preparing to rival Arsenal for Rice, who recently followed in the footsteps of West Ham legends Bobby Moore and Billy Bonds to end the club's 43-year wait for a major trophy. Arsenal have already had two bids rejected by West Ham - the latter a bid of Â£75m in guaranteed money plus Â£15m in add-ons - and there's an expectation a third offer will be lodged imminently after lengthy talks between the two clubs. But City have now looked to steal a march on Arsenal by making a formal offer of their own, 90min understands, worth Â£80m in guaranteed money plus Â£10m in potential add-ons. West Ham's majority owner David Sullivan has publicly admitted that Rice is likely to leave the club this summer - the 24-year-old has spoken of his desire to play in the Champions League and regularly compete for trophies - but 90min has extensively reported that a transfer will not take place unless a club is prepared to pay upwards of Â£100m. feed City's bid falls short of that figure but is believed to offer West Ham a more significant amount of money up front, in contrast to Arsenal's offer which was structured to deliver payments over a number of years. Rice effectively has two years remaining on his contract because West Ham hold an option to extend his deal beyond the summer of 2024, and he has become one of European football's most in-demand players. Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Chelsea the three other heavyweight clubs to show interest in a player released by the latter's academy aged 14. West Ham are yet to respond to City's offer, which sources have confirmed to 90min does not include Kalvin Phillips in any way. The England international has struggled to command regular minutes at the Etihad Stadium following his Â£42m move from Leeds United, and is one of a number of players being eyed to potentially replace Rice. The Hammers also hold an interest in Fulham's Joao Palhinha, who impressed in his maiden Premier League season after opting to leave Portuguese giants Sporting CP."
Transfer notebook: Roy Hodgson agrees Crystal Palace stay,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/transfer-notebook-roy-hodgson-agrees-crystal-palace-stay,"Roy Hodgson has agreed terms with Crystal Palace to stay in charge as manager for another season, 90min understands. Hodgson, who took charge of 162 games in his first spell as Palace manager from 2017 to 2021, returned to Selhurst Park in March after Patrick Vieira was dismissed from his post. The veteran coach won five of his ten games in charge at the backend of the 2022/23 term - including three in a row to begin his second stint - to banish fears of relegation and an agreement with chairman Steve Parish has been reached for Hodgson to remain in role for another year. The deal is not yet signed but Palace are planning on the former England boss leading them into the 2023/24 campaign, having mulled the decision over since May. Juventus are now confident Adrien Rabiot will reject from clubs including Manchester United to sign a new contract in Italy. La Vecchia Signora have been waiting on a decision from the France international over the past week or so but expect him to extend his stay in Turin by signing a new contract. His current deal expires this summer. Manchester United had offered a larger salary to the midfielder, but Rabiot has decided to stay with Juve after scoring eight goals in 32 Serie A appearances last season. Inter remain keen to bring Romelu Lukaku back to San Siro and the Belgium international is expected to seal an exit from Chelsea this summer. All three parties remain keen to conclude a deal, with Inter infatuated by Lukaku's commitment and passion for the club. However, the Blues are keen to negotiate a permanent exit for the striker. Elsewhere at Inter, Al Nassr have focused their energy on signing Marcelo Brozovic - a target for Barcelona - after wrapping up a move for Hakim Ziyech. West Ham have spoken with with Serie A side Torino about defender Perr Schuurs, who impressed in his first season in Italy after a move from Ajax. There will be natural contact between the clubs as a decision is still needed on the future of Nikola Vlasic. The Croatian scored five goals in 34 Serie A games on loan from the Hammers and Il Toro are yet to take up their option to buy. feed Several Premier League clubs could try to take advantage if Sheffield United are left needing to sell leading midfielders Sander Berge and Iliman Ndiaye this summer. Owner Prince Abdullah is seeking a sale but the situation looks set to hamper the clubâs preparations for the season ahead until the process is concluded. Berge and Ndiaye both have contracts which expire in 2024 and 90min understands United could look to sell the duo this summer to ensure incoming transfer fees. Berge has long been on Fulham's radar, who tried to sign him in January and and could move again if Joao Palhinha departs. West Ham, Newcastle, Wolves and Everton have all shown previous interest in the Norway international. Everton are also among the sides interested in Ndiaye. The Toffees were unsuccessful with a January approach but are continued admirers. There is significant competition from France, however, with Marseille and Lens both alert as they each seek to strengthen ahead of next season's Champions League. Fulham and Wolves have both made opening enquiries for Sevilla winger Lucas Ocampos. The Argentine was sent back to the Spanish side after a botched loan spell with Ajax and helped them to the Europa League title, scoring in the final's penalty shootout. âï¸ Welcome to #BrentfordFC, Ji-soo Kim!The young defender signs from Seongnam on a four-year contract with a club option of an additional yearFull story â¡ï¸ https://t.co/KkS9QEwt7V#BrentfordFC pic.twitter.com/2DZO3XVFQM Brentford fended off competition from a number of European clubs to wrap up the signing of South Korea youth international Kim Ji-soo on a four-year contract.

The figure Chelsea are prepared to accept from Man Utd for Mason Mount,"Jun 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-prepared-to-accept-man-utd-mason-mount,"Manchester United are still in the market to sign Mason Mount from Premier League rivals Chelsea despite their decision not to follow up on a rejected third offer for the England international. United lodged an offer totalling Â£55m including add-ons on Friday, though the Blues knocked back the bid for a third time and instead proposed a deal worth a total of Â£65m - Â£58m of which was guaranteed plus Â£7m in add-ons. 90min understands and has reported that United are not prepared to meet that price and are exploring alternative targets. However, 90min has also learned that there may be a middle ground between the existing proposals for the two parties to strike a deal, despite the current Â£10m gap in valuations. Chelsea would be expected to close the transfer if United hit a figure of Â£60m with a new offer, 90min understands, which is below their latest counter proposal and just Â£5m above United's most recent bid. It's understood that if United are to hit that figure, the Blues are likely to close the transfer. Mount has indicated his preferred destination is United if he leaves Chelsea. United have however shown no willingness at this point to increase their offer, insisting that their rejected Â£55m bid was their final approach as it was made. United have cited that they feel Chelsea are adding a ""United tax"" to the deal, as the club have shown a habit in the past of caving in to sellers for a number of players they've signed. Chelsea bought Raheem Sterling last summer for around Â£47.5m and are on the verge of selling Mateo Kovacic for Â£25m plus Â£5m in add-ons to Manchester City. Both players were in the final year of their respective contracts on moving and United feel Chelsea's current valuation of Mount in context is unreasonable, given his deal is up in a year's time. manual Mount's age (24) and homegrown status however, combined with Chelsea's sales of Kovacic, Kai Havertz to Arsenal and a number of squad players to teams in Saudi Arabia has alleviated their position in respect to Financial Fair Play. Chelsea are keen to raise money by Friday this week to attach to their books from this season. They are, however, willing sellers given Mount's request to leave, and feel a deal totalling Â£60m would be acceptable if United come back to the table. Despite the impasse in negotiations at the moment, the feeling is that the deal will eventually be concluded. If it isn't, Mount could be reintegrated into the Chelsea first team fold under new manager Mauricio Pochettino and the Blues are expected to continue attempting to secure a contract extension. United's interest in Moises Caicedo has been made known but 90min understands a deal will be challenging at best, as Brighton value him in a similar bracket to Declan Rice - who could leave West Ham in the coming weeks for a fee of Â£100m or more. Caicedo is contracted until 2028 and younger than Rice, who United also hold interest in but are unable to stretch to do a deal for without adding players in exchange. United have issues with their current budget, but are also looking to sign a new first choice striker and may need to sign a new goalkeeper to replace David de Gea, who is out of contract on Friday. The uncertainty over the club's ownership is only adding to the early difficulty with their summer transfer plans. A contract has been offered by United to Juventus' Adrien Rabiot, who also sees his deal expire on June 30. The Frenchman is currently weighing up an offer from the Italian side but United have made their interest known over a number of months. The player will make a decision on his next move in the coming days."
Brighton hold talks with representatives of Man Utd target,"Jun 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/brighton-hold-talks-man-utd-target,"Brighton are the latest club to show interest in Ajax star Mohammed Kudus, 90min understands, with Manchester United already exploring a possible deal in recent months. Kudu scored three goals in the Champions League group stage, including against Liverpool, during the first half of 2022/23 and then went on to impress at the 2022 World Cup with Ghana. During the tournament, 90min reported that Arsenal, Tottenham and Newcastle all made enquiries, with Liverpool already aware of his ability and Everton retaining interest after failing to get a proposed Â£15m deal over the line last summer. Borussia Dortmund, PSG, Lyon, Napoli and Atletico Madrid were also keeping tabs on the playerâs progress in Qatar. United began exploring a possible transfer for the versatile attacking player in January when they were trying to source a replacement for Cristiano Ronaldo. Ultimately, however, the Old Trafford preferred a cheaper option at that time and recruited Wout Weghorst on loan. feed But Erik ten Hag remains keen on a new forward and has already worked extensively with Kudus, who has operated as a number 10, number nine and on the right flank for Ajax this past season, owing to two years already spent together in Amsterdam. 90min understands that United remain keen on Kudus now and donât view the 22-year-old as an alternative to Mason Mount, for whom three bids have been rejected by Chelsea, given that their interest in the Ghanaian dates back a number of months already. But there will be increased competition for his signature. Brighton are not only interested, but have also established contact with the playerâs representatives and held early talks."
Arsenal tell Folarin Balogun to step up search for new club,"Jun 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-tell-folarin-balogun-search-new-club,"Arsenal have told Folarin Balogun's representatives to work on finding a new club after he again rejected the chance to discuss a new deal, 90min understands. The 21-year-old, who recently switched his international allegiance from England to the United States of America, spent the 2022/23 season on loan at Stade Reims, and enjoyed a fruitful spell as he scored 21 goals in 37 Ligue 1 appearances. Only Kylian Mbappe, Alexandre Lacazette and Jonathan David had a better scoring record in France's top flight than Balogun last season, so there were high hopes for the younster returning to Arsenal and getting a chance to impress under Mikel Arteta. ""What I can say is that I definitely won't go on loan again,"" Balogun recently stressed about his future. ""I'm not sure [about] the discussions that are going to take place, I'm not sure what's going to happen."" But rather than Balogun being given a route into Arsenal's first team, a permanent departure from the Emirates Stadium appears to be the most likely scenario at present. feed Sources have confirmed to 90min that Balogun has again rejected the opportunity to renew his contract at Arsenal, while reiterating that he has no intention to be farmed out on loan - something the club had been considering given they have Gabriel Jesus and Eddie Nketiah ahead of him in the pecking order, as well as Kai Havertz also on his way in from Chelsea. Arsenal have told Balogun's representatives to begin work on finding a new club, with an alternative resolution not looking likely at this stage. Crystal Palace, West Ham, Brentford, Fulham and Everton are among the clubs to have made contact, 90min further understands, and several sides on the continent have also expressed an interest in a player Arsenal value at over Â£30m. Lille, another Ligue 1 outfit, are understood to be monitoring Balogun's situation while the future of star striker Jonathan David remains unclear, while RB Leipzig are also considering their options should a move for Lens' Lois Openda not progress as hoped."
RB Leipzig make Josko Gvardiol transfer fee demand clear to Man City,"Jun 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/rb-leipzig-josko-gvardiol-transfer-fee-demand-man-city,"RB Leipzig have made it clear to Manchester City they expect a world record fee for a defender to sell Josko Gvardiol, 90min understands. City have long regarded Gvardiol as one of their top summer targets - already revealed by 90min in April - and now they are pushing on with talks for the Croatian star. Sources have confirmed to 90min talks between Gvardiol's representatives and City have gone well and personal terms are agreed 'in principle' leading to confidence that a deal will soon happen. Negotiations between the two clubs are now ongoing, with Leipzig seeking a sum that surpasses the Â£80m that Manchester United paid Leicester for Harry Maguire in 2019 - the current world record transfer for a defender. feed Although City are keen not to go as high as the â¬100m (Â£85.5m) Leipzig are looking for, they do recognise that a world record bid is likely required to get the deal done. With a deal already in place for Chelsea midfielder Mateo Kovacic, City are hoping to make Gvardiol their second Croatian signing of the summer as they unite the international colleagues. The Premier League and newly crowned European champions are looking to make room for Gvardiol in their squad next season with the sale of Spain international Aymeric Laporte, who is attracting interest from a number of the Premier League clubs including Aston Villa and Tottenham."
Barcelona complete signing of Man City captain Ilkay Gundogan,"Jun 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-complete-signing-man-city-ilkay-gundogan,"Barcelona have completed the signing of Manchester City captain Ilkay Gundogan on a two-year contract. The 32-year-old's deal at Camp Nou includes the option to extend for a further 12 months, bringing to an end a hugely successful seven-year stay at the Etihad Stadium. Gundogan was a hugely influential figure last season as City ended their long wait for a first Champions League crown, and he also played a significant role as the club overhauled long-time leaders Arsenal in the Premier League title race. The German's influence didn't stop there, with a brace of goals at Wembley helping City overcome neighbourhood rivals Manchester United 2-1 to win the FA Cup  - the first goal a superb volley from outside the area in what was the fastest ever goal in a final. Gundogan was out of contract at the Etihad this summer and despite Pep Guardiola's desire for him to stay, he has opted to head to La Liga for a new challenge. âFor me it has been a total privilege and pleasure to be part of Manchester City for the last seven years,âÂ Gundogan told City's official website upon confirmation of his exit. âManchester has been my home and I have felt part of a very special family at City. âI have been lucky to have experienced so many unforgettable moments in my time here and to have been captain for this extra special season has been the greatest experience of my career. manual âFirst, I would like to thank Pep. To have been able to play under and learn from him for so long has been something I will never forget. I would also like to thank all my team-mates â past and present â who have all played such a special part in making my time here so amazing. âFinally, I would like to thank the incredible City fans. They have supported me from the moment I arrived, and I owe them all so much for their support. âThis club made me realise all my dreams and I will forever be thankful for this opportunity. âI will carry City always in my heart. Once a blue, always a blue.â Gundogan made 304 appearances for City in all competitions, scoring 60 goals from midfield. He won the Premier League title five times, the FA Cup twice, the Carabao Cup four times, the Community Shield twice and, perhaps most importantly, the Champions League. He'll now slot into a Barcelona midfield that includes the likes of Pedri, Frenkie de Jong and Gavi, with Xavi's side now primed to push for Champions League glory after romping to last season's La Liga title ahead of rivals Real Madrid."

Jorginho teases Kai Havertz's imminent move to Arsenal on social media,"Jun 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jorginho-teases-kai-havertz-imminent-move-arsenal-social-media,"Arsenal midfielder Jorginho has dropped a massive hint that his former Chelsea teammate Kai Havertz will soon complete a move to the Gunners. 90min understands that the two rivals have agreed a fee that will see the Germany forward move from west London to north London. The transfer is expected to be finalised in the next few days, and Jorginho - who made the same journey from Stamford Bridge to the Emirates Stadium back in January - has stirred the pot with a cryptic post on social media. Jorginho and Havertz are among a number of Chelsea players past and present who are at the wedding of Kepa Arrizabalaga, with the likes of Manchester City-bound Mateo Kovacic and Barcelona's Andreas Christensen also guests. But Jorginho notably took the time to take a selfie with Havertz alone, posting it to his Instagram story alongside laughing face and eye emojis. â³ðð¸ (@jorginhofrello/IG) pic.twitter.com/hnWbOta0F5 90min reported earlier this summer that Havertz was a target for Real Madrid following Karim Benzema's sudden departure to Al Ittihad, but they were ultimately put off by Chelsea's asking price.

Havertz will leave Chelsea best remembered for scoring the winner in the 2021 UEFA Champions League final, but underwhelming for the most part across his three-year spell."
How Chelsea could line up with Nicolas Jackson,"Jun 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/how-chelsea-could-line-up-with-nicolas-jackson,"Chelsea have a rather cursed history with big-name striker signings. Andriy Shevchenko. Fernando Torres. Romelu Lukaku. Alvaro Morata. Gonzalo Higuain. Timo Werner. Romelu Lukaku again. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Perhaps the relative obscurity of Nicolas Jackson, coming off the back of a fine breakout season at Villarreal, could help lower expectations upon arrival at Stamford Bridge. Hey, Chelsea don't have a lot left to lose at this point. So while the rest of the world tries to come up with chants to the tune of Ms Jackson by Outkast, we've devised some ways in which Mauricio Pochettino could use his new striker. feed Chelsea's striking options heading into the new season are looking a little thin, even though they're paradoxically numerous. Kai Havertz is joining Arsenal. Lukaku wants to go back to Inter. Aubameyang could very well leave. Armando Broja is coming off a serious injury. Christopher Nkunku isn't really a number nine. David Datro Fofana is likely to leave on loan. There's a good chance for Jackson to come straight into pre-season and impress Pochettino, to stake an early claim to start up front alone in the Argentine's preferred 4-2-3-1 formation. Madueke - Nkunku - Sterling - Jackson Madueke - Nkunku - Mudryk - Jackson Nkunku - Mount - Sterling - Jackson Though Pochettino is likely to play a 4-2-3-1 - both because that's how best to utilise his pressing tactics and Chelsea's squad lends itself nicely to the system - he has deviated from his norm to play two strikers together. In his later days at Tottenham, he pushed Son Heung-min up alongside Harry Kane to essentially do his pressing and running for him, while Spurs also switched to a 3-5-2 when starting as a 3-4-3 on occasion. If Pochettino is able to put his arm around the likes of Aubameyang and Lukaku to get them to buy into Chelsea's new project, they could make ideal partners for Jackson. Aubameyang - Jackson Lukaku - Jackson Broja - Jackson We've already mentioned Nkunku as a number ten behind Jackson and the possibility of the Senegal international playing with a partner, but this is an option which deserves a standalone category. Nkunku is the perfect modern-day shadow striker, and Pochettino famously oversaw the development of Dele Alli when he was more befitting of that title at a young age. Could Nkunku and Jackson be the new Dele and Kane? Probably not, but they could make a fine tribute act."
Kalidou Koulibaly completes move to Al Hilal from Chelsea,"Jun 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/kalidou-koulibaly-completes-move-to-al-hilal-from-chelsea,"Kalidou Koulibaly has joined Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal after just one season at Chelsea. The Senegal defender has put pen to paper on a lucrative deal in the Middle East, bringing the curtain down on a short stay in England. He becomes Al Hilal's second high-profile signing this month after they added Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves to their ranks. Al Hilal had hoped to bring in Lionel Messi but he has instead opted to head to MLS side Inter Miami. Koulibaly signed for Chelsea during the summer 2022 transfer window, widely seen as their successor to Antonio Rudiger after he joined Real Madrid. He quickly endeared himself to fans with a superb volley to open the scoring in a 2-2 draw with rivals Tottenham on the second weekend of the 2022/23 season. Injuries limited Koulibaly to only 23 Premier League games in his only campaign in England. manual In a statement, Chelsea said: ""We would like to thank Kalidou for his contributions on and off the pitch during his time at Stamford Bridge and wish him well for the next stage of his career."" Koulibaly is the first of at least three Chelsea players heading to Saudi Arabia this summer.

Mikel Arteta speaks out on Arsenal's interest in Declan Rice & Kai Havertz,"Jun 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/mikel-arteta-speaks-arsenal-interest-declan-rice-kai-havertz,"Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has conceded 'talent comes at a price' as the Gunners push to complete the expensive signings of both West Ham's Declan Rice and Chelsea's Kai Havertz. West Ham have already knocked back two bids from Arsenal for Rice, who they value at over Â£100m. The Gunners' latest offer, a package worth Â£90m, was rejected and Arsenal now face pressure from Manchester City to get a deal done. Speaking to Marca, Arteta was first asked about Rice and, given the current status of Arsenal's pursuit of the midfielder, remained predictably tight-lipped. ""I can't talk about players who are not in the club. I prefer not to say anything,"" he said. Arsenal's pursuit of Havertz is far calmer, however, with a fee of Â£65m agreed to lure the Germany international over from Chelsea, and that was reflected in the freedom with which Arteta discussed this second move. feed ""Talent comes at a price, and at Arsenal we are always interested in youngsters with experience,"" Arteta continued.  ""I repeat, I'm not talking about players from other clubs, but in the case of Kai he has already shown a lot, including [winning] a Champions League. He is a talented player, versatile and only 24 years old."" Spending money to rejuvenate the squad has been key for Arteta, who has overseen the drastic lowering of Arsenal's average age. ""We have already regenerated the squad, with a very young average and to generate performance and value,"" he explained. ""We have some owners aligned with us: build a winning team that is sustained over time, without so much investment.  ""But the demand is increasing and you have to go to the market to find what we don't have to continue improving."""

Diaz has excelled in Uruguay with Liverpool Montevideo and recently played a starring role in his country's run to glory at the Under-20 World Cup, with his performances attracting plenty of interest from across Europe. Barcelona have been touted as potential suitors as Xavi is on the lookout for another midfielder to replace Sergio Busquets, with Diaz seen as a potential star of both the present and future. If BarÃ§a are to pursue a deal for Diaz, they will need to meet the â¬8m asking price which was laid out by Liverpool Montevideo president Jose Luis Palma. ""[Diaz's] price is â¬8m,"" Palma revealed. ""It is likely that he will be sold in August."" feed Having seen their feasibility plan approved by La Liga, Barcelona have begun chasing their transfer targets and have already struck an agreement to land Ilkay Gundogan on a free transfer after his Manchester City contract expired. Gundogan will likely play in a more advanced role, however, leaving Xavi needing a new face to replace Busquets. 90min understands there is interest in Inter midfielder Marcelo Brozovic but Barcelona are facing serious pressure from Saudi Arabia's Al Nassr, who are capable of offering the sort of money no longer available at Camp Nou. Barcelona have asked Brozovic's representatives for more time to put together a formal offer, whereas Al Nassr are pushing to complete a move immediately."
Man Utd remain in Mason Mount talks despite third rejected bid,"Jun 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-remain-mason-mount-talks-third-rejected-bid,"Manchester United have not walked away from the negotiating table over Mason Mount despite seeing a third bid rejected for the Chelsea midfielder, 90min understands. United saw their latest offer of Â£50m plus Â£5m in add-ons rejected by Chelsea on Friday and had previously threatened to walk away if their bid was not accepted, with club officials thought to be wary of another prolonged transfer saga. However, sources have confirmed to 90min lines of communication remain open between the two sides, whose valuations of Mount are close but, crucially, fall on opposite sides of the Â£60m mark. United are adamant they will not pay over the odds for Mount and believe Chelsea's demands are unreasonable for a player who has just one year remaining on his contract. On the other side of the table, Chelsea have dropped their Â£70m asking price and countered United's offer with a proposal of Â£58m plus a further Â£7m - a Â£65m package in total. feed The two sides are currently Â£10m apart in valuation and neither is currently showing signs of budging, but United believe a deal can still be agreed and have not yet turned away. However, with an agreement far from certain at this point, United are exploring possible alternatives and are known admirers of Juventus' Adrien Rabiot. The Frenchman is available on a free transfer this summer but could still end up staying in Turin, although a number of sides are thought to be keen to lure him away. Chelsea are prepared to cash in on Mount, whose sale would clearly go a long way to help balance their books, but only for the right price. The Blues have seen their finances strengthened already this month after agreeing deals to part ways with a number of first-team players. Kai Havertz is on the cusp of a Â£65m move to Arsenal and Mateo Kovacic will soon join Manchester City for up to Â£30m, while Kalidou Koulibaly, Edouard Mendy and Hakim Ziyech will all move to Saudi Arabia in the coming days for around Â£40m combined."

Every PIF signing in the 2023 summer transfer window,"Jul 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/every-pif-signing-2023-summer-transfer-window,"In the summer of 2023, the Saudi Pro League is determined to make a giant splash worldwide. Elite level football has historically had its roots in Europe thanks to the dominance of the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A, but Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund means unrivalled sums of cash are being used to prise players away from Europe like Major League Soccer and the Chinese Super League did before. PIF is also the majority owner at Newcastle. The sovereign wealth fund is now pumping money into Al Ahli, Al Ittihad, Al Hilal and Al Nassr with the aim of attracting more star names to make the move and subsequently boost the international stature of the league. Given how quickly these clubs are moving, here's a look at the players who have already made the move to the Saudi Pro League following PIF's new control of Al Ahli, Al Ittihad, Al Hilal and Al Nassr. Certainly the biggest name to head to Saudi Arabia so far this summer, Karim Benzema is the profile of player you would expect to make this move. Now 35 years old, the former France international is within his rights to welcome a change of pace even if he still scored 31 goals in all competitions for Real Madrid last season. With his contract expiring, Benzema chose to join Al Ittihad on a three-year deal. The Frenchman is expected to earn a frightening Â£172m per year, whereas his Real terms netted him only Â£14.5m a year. Another big name who will be at Al Ittihad next season is N'Golo Kante. The French midfielder will join compatriot Benzema after leaving Chelsea. After speculation over his future, Kante chose Al Ittihad despite only being 31 and seemingly having more to achieve in Europe. Through the course of his four-year deal with the Saudi Pro League team Kante is expected to earn Â£21.5m per season. It's not exactly Benzema's level, but it's a big raise on the rough Â£15m Chelsea were paying him each year. If you're not a fan of these deals taking place, this is the most 'concerning' one.  Ruben Neves joined Al Hilal for a fee of around Â£45m and is comfortably in his prime at only 26 years old. Reports suggest Neves is set to be paid Â£300,000 a week in Saudi Arabia, which will not be taxed. An English side would need to pay him Â£600,000 if they were to match his take-home pay. There have been reports suggesting Neves could be loaned to Newcastle in the future, which would add more than a degree of seediness to the whole affair. Of course, 'PIF signings' does not just mean teams from the Saudi Pro League. Newcastle have swiped one of the best young midfielders in the world away from AC Milan after their bid of around â¬70m was accepted pretty quickly. There was a general feeling Tonali could have spent the rest of his career at Milan, but that will not be the case. His move suggests Newcastle are able to pluck players from anywhere now, even clubs with the history and stature of Milan. Once revered as one of the best defenders in Europe, Kalidou Koulibaly jumped ship from Napoli for his big-money move to Chelsea at the wrong time. Napoli won the Serie A title while the Blues came 12th in the Premier League. Al Hilal have swooped in, adding to their ranks with the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations winner. Edouard Mendy looked like one of the bargains of the century when he played a starring role in Chelsea's 2021 Champions League success. That triumph more than compensates for his dramatic loss of form since, with error-prone Kepa Arrizabalaga seen as the more secure bet for Mauricio Pochettino. Mendy has completed a move to Al Ahli. Marcelo Brozovic's last game for Inter ended up being the Champions League final defeat to Manchester City. The Croatia international has achieved plenty in the game, winning Serie A alongside some domestic trophies. Al Nassr have bolstered their squad which finished second last season by welcoming Brozovic to Riyadh. Roberto Firmino stuck it out during the tough early spells of his Liverpool career to become an all-time legend at Anfield. The Brazilian formed a wonderful partnership with Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane but was a victim of the Reds' need for a rebuild, not getting an extension on his contract. Al Ahli subsequently picked the forward up on a free transfer. Jota was name-dropped by Cristiano Ronaldo recently as an example of the Saudi Pro League's appeal due to his and compatriot Ruben Neves' relative youth. The former Portugal youth international spent two successful seasons with Celtic, often turning up on the biggest occasions, and will hope for more grandstand moments over in the Middle East. Lens finished second in Ligue 1 last season to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 2002/03, when they came third in a group containing AC Milan, Deportivo La Coruna and Bayern Munich. It wasn't enough to keep club captain Seko Fofana around, the midfielder departing for Al Nassr, though Lens have taken the step of making Fofana a stakeholder at the club in a show of respect. Perennially linked with Europe's top clubs - most frequently and laboriously Manchester United - Sergej Milinkovic-Savic has everything a dynamic midfielder needs to succeed at one of the biggest teams in the world."
Best signings of the 2023/24 Premier League summer transfer window - ranked,"Jul 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/best-signings-2023-24-premier-league-ranked,"Latter-day Maurizio Sarri has evolved into the grumpy idealogue of the footballing world. ""All this transfer talk does my head in, there's nothing more dull than that,"" the former Napoli and Chelsea manager sniffed while in charge of Lazio. But based on the unrelenting churn of the rumour mill, it appears sulky Sarri is in the minority. The excitement of endless possibilities conjured during the transfer window outstrips the underwhelming reality of the regular season for many fans - only a handful of clubs harbour any realistic hopes of winning a trophy, and even fewer actually lift any silverware. However, every club has the chance to make a clever addition in the off-season. Here are some of the best snapped up by Premier League sides this summer. Kovacic won't bring anything Manchester City haven't seen before but with the departure of Ilkay Gundogan to Manchester City, Pep Guardiola needed a solid all-rounder to come in.City took advantage of Chelsea's summer fire sale by picking up Croatia international Kovacic, who won his fourth Champions League with the Blues having previously won three with Real Madrid.His injury record is a worry but Kovacic shouldn't have any issues gelling with the squad at the Etihad. Unai Emery has grand aspirations for Aston Villa and has been reunited with defender Pau Torres, who played under the former Arsenal manager at Villarreal.Torres joins Tyrone Mings, Ezri Konsa and Diego Carlos as centre back options for Villa but the Spain international's Â£31.5m arrival suggests he's nailed on for a starting berth.Torres knows what it takes to win in Europe as a Europa League winner in 2021 and will be targeting more continental success as Villa compete in the Europa Conference League. A few viral clips of Sandro Tonali visiting St James' Park and looking glum certainly shone a light at Newcastle's new-found pulling power over clubs like AC Milan.The Magpies' evolution is a little ahead of schedule with Champions League football on the menu for the first time since 2002/03 but with Italy international Tonali's arrival they have added another level of depth to midfield.He's not the finished article yet but his role in the Rossoneri's Serie A title win of 2021/22 shows Tonali may well live up to some early Andrea Pirlo comparisons. Mikel Arteta needed to add greater quality in depth to his Arsenal backline this summer and has done exactly that in drafting in former Ajax defender Jurrien Timber.The Netherlands international is capable of slotting in across the back four and won't get caught out by any high pressing thanks to his ease in possession.Timber was part of the Dutch squads for Euro 2020 and the 2022 World Cup and arrives with two Eredivisie titles in his cabinet. In what was the worst kept secret of the summer window so far - if there are any secrets these days - Mason Mount left boyhood club Chelsea for Premier League rivals Manchester United.The England international was a frequent presence in the starting XI when the Blues won the Champions League but became somewhat of a divisive figure at Stamford Bridge. He was a frequent goal threat, totting up 33 strikes in 195 competitive appearances.For a guaranteed Â£55m with Â£5m in potential add-ons, Man Utd have acquired a hard-working midfield who should be able to gel well with Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford. Fans throughout Europe have long tracked the progress of Dominik Szoboszlai, who first popped up as a youth prospect with Salzburg.Rubbing shoulders with the likes of Erling Haaland and Takumi Minamino in Austria and Christopher Nkunku, Emil Forsberg and Dani Olmo later at RB Leipzig, Szoboszlai enjoyed prolific partnerships in attack at both franchise clubs before Liverpool met his Â£60m release clause.The Hungary international has all the desirable characteristics of a Jurgen Klopp midfielder and all eyes are glued to see how well he settles at Anfield. James Maddison was one of the players plucked from the bargain bucket of relegated clubs, joining Tottenham from Leicester in a Â£40m deal.The attacking midfielder has the exact profile of playmaking Spurs have been lacking in recent seasons, bringing a threat from set pieces and a creative mindset not previously encouraged in north London.He may have to figure out how he and Harry Kane co-exist - if the striker remains at Tottenham - but the potential link-up play with Dejan Kulusevski and Son Heung-min is dreamy. Chelsea have been burned before when signing a Bundesliga forward on the back of a goal-laden season with a lofty reputation.However, Christopher Nkunku possesses a more well-rounded game than the speed-merchant Timo Werner and - at Â£51m - doesn't represent the same tier of financial investment as Kai Havertz. After the last game of Brighton's season, Roberto De Zerbi hailed Alexis Mac Allister as one of the team's 'big, big players' capable of playing 'in a big, big European team'. Liverpool snapped up the 24-year-old early in the window, ensuring that Mac Allister will have a full pre-season to get embedded into Klopp's team.With the experience of working under De Zerbi and Graham Potter on the south coast, Mac Allister is no stranger to demanding tactical briefs. The World Cup winner offers versatility, energy and end product.At an initial fee of just Â£35m, potentially rising to Â£55m in time, Mac Allister could even prove to be the bargain of the summer."

Hakimi joined Borussia Dortmund on a two-year loan in 2018 before signing for Inter on a permanent transfer. He established himself as one of the best attacking full-backs in the world, but then left for Paris Saint-Germain after just one season at San Siro due to the Nerazzurri's financial issues.

Investment in Saudi Arabia's top flight has gone through the roof in recent months. It started with Cristiano Ronaldo joining Al-Nassr at the start of January but has picked up considerably since the end of the 2022/23 season. Karim Benzema joined newly crowned Al-Ittihad from Real Madrid, followed by N'Golo Kante from Chelsea.

Cesar Azpilicueta closing in on Inter move,"Jun 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/cesar-azpilicueta-closing-in-inter-move,"Chelsea defender Cesar Azpilicueta is closing in on a move to Serie A side Inter, 90min understands.

European Under-21 Championship stars and the clubs they could join this summer,"Jun 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/european-under-21-championship-stars-clubs-they-could-join,"For those who do not treat youth tournaments as their primary point of interest in football, competitions such as the Under-20 World Cup or the European Under-21 Championship can appear out of nowhere. They are always thrilling to watch as viewers get an early look at some of the stars of the future. Given how quickly many players are able to burst onto the scene these days, there will be a lot of very recognisable names at the Under-21 Euros in Romania and Georgia which got underway on June 21 and run until the final on July 8. More importantly, there will be a lot of players in action who are already being linked with moves to some very big clubs. 90min has the lowdown on every player on this list of 2023 U21 Euros stars to keep an eye on as the transfer market gets into full swing. manual Belgian attacker Lois Openda was one of the best players in Ligue 1 last season and came close to leading RC Lens to a shock league title at the expense of Paris Saint-Germain. Had the Parisien side had one more wobble, it could have been a different story. Openda got 21 league goals and four assists last season which is why the 23-year-old is being linked with a big move to either AC Milan or RB Leipzig. Premier League sides like Manchester United, Liverpool, Newcastle and more have all been to see him in action recently. Lens are demanding â¬50m given he has another four years left on his contract. He only joined them last summer from Club Brugge and will be one of the most confident players at the tournament. Certainly one of the biggest names in the summer transfer window so far, it will be amazing if Khephren Thuram is still a Nice player next season. The young French defensive midfielder has already shown he has so many elements of midfield play in his locker. One of them is stamina; he played an incredible 48 games this season for Nice across all competitions. The team he seems to be the most heavily linked with is Liverpool, which is a theme for midfielders on this list. The Premier League side have been in talks with Nice but he is one of many targets Jurgen Klopp has in midfield. Another midfield name that seems to be a serious target for Liverpool, Gabri Veiga was the shining light for Celta Vigo in 2022/23 in a really tough campaign. He's an exciting attacking midfielder who grabbed 11 La Liga goals and four assists despite being in a poor side. Chelsea and Barcelona have also been linked with Veiga and it seems very likely that there will be a lot of eyes on him at the U21 Euros. Almost every big club in Europe has been watching Veiga in the second half of the season. Levi Colwill could be one of the big movers in the Premier League this season. Many Chelsea fans have been baffled by the refusal to use him in the past, but they made the right call in loaning him to Brighton. He has flourished into one of the best ball-playing defenders in the Premier League. Brighton are now prepared to try and break their transfer record for the Chelsea man. Tottenham have also been linked with Colwill, who has told Chelsea he would like to leave if he is not going to be a firm part of the first team next season. OK, this is the final Liverpool-linked midfielder on the list. Ryan Gravenberch was in a similar position last year while still an Ajax player before moving to Bayern Munich. That seemed like the end of it, but he has not managed to find his form in Bavaria and has told the club he wants to leave if he does not get more game time. Liverpool were heavily linked last year, but they now feel they could get a cut-price deal for the Dutchman. That could be a loan with an optional fee, but either way, they will be watching him closely at the U21 Euros this summer. Arguably the player closest to actually making a move on this list, Sandro Tonali suddenly looks as though he will not be an AC Milan player next season. He took less money to join the team he supports, but it seems he and Milan cannot turn down the riches of Newcastle United. The two clubs have now come to an agreement for his sale and while Tonali is really key to Milan, he is not irreplaceable. The sad truth for Serie A is no club in the league can turn down a â¬70m bid for a player like Tonali, especially when there are cheaper replacements available.  There's a very good generation of players coming through in Georgia right now. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia is the headline maker, but Giorgi Mamardashvili has been superb in goal for Valencia and is part of the reason they avoided a shock relegation to the Segunda Division."

The players with the highest combined transfer fees,"Jun 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/players-highest-combined-transfer-fees,"We all know transfer fees have been going through the roof over the last decade. In fact, there seems to be no limit as to how high transfer fees can soar. It's one thing to shine brightly enough to be bought for tens of millions of pounds, but it is arguably more impressive to consistently command eye-watering sums of money across multiple moves. We're going to look at the players who have had the most spent on them in transfer fees during their career. manual Obviously. Zlatan Ibrahimovic had to feature here and just three or four years ago he would be ranked much higher. The Swedish star, who recently retired, has played for many of the biggest clubs in the world. Naturally, that means he has moved more than average and the fees have been larger than average. Money has been paid for Ibrahimovic's services on seven different occasions, with the biggest fee being the â¬69.5m (plus Samuel Eto'o) Barcelona paid Inter for him in 2009. Transfer Date Fee Malmo to Ajax July 1, 2001 â¬7.8m Ajax to Juventus August 31, 2004 â¬16m Juventus to Inter August 10, 2006 â¬24.8m Inter to Barcelona July 27, 2009 â¬69.5m Barcelona to AC Milan August 28, 2010 â¬6m (loan fee) Barcelona to AC Milan July 1, 2011 â¬24m AC Milan to PSG July 18, 2012 â¬21m There was a time when it seemed Ousmane Dembele would light up European football for many years. Things have not quite panned out that way, mainly due to injuries, but he has still had some superb moments and there are plenty of years ahead of him.  Only two fees have ever been paid for Ousmane Dembele and one of them was absolutely massive. He joined Barcelona in 2017 for what was the second-biggest transfer fee ever paid at the time. Transfer Date Fee Stade Rennes to Borussia Dortmund July 1, 2016 â¬35m Borussia Dortmund to Barcelona August 25, 2017 â¬135m It is not quite to the same extent as Ibrahimovic, but Angel Di Maria has played for some very big clubs during his career. He has moved for a fee four times in his career, and three of them were very big at the time. Transfer Date Fee Rosario to Benfica July 27, 2007 â¬8m Benfica to Real Madrid July 1, 2010 â¬33m Real Madrid to Manchester United August 26, 2014 â¬75m Manchester United to PSG August 6, 2015 â¬63m This is a name that could well rise up the list in the future, although the idea of him leaving PSG for free in 2024 is very, very plausible now. Kylian Mbappe has only ever moved for one fee, but it was an absolute monster. If he goes for a price again, it could well be bigger depending on the circumstances. Transfer Date Fee Monaco to PSG July 1, 2018 â¬180m Mbappe's France teammate, Antoine Griezmann, has racked up the same figure, but he has moved more frequently than his junior compatriot. Griezmann has moved for money on three occasions, although that is set to become four at the end of June when he signs permanently for Atletico Madrid. Transfer Date Fee Real Sociedad to Atletico Madrid July 28, 2014 â¬30m Atletico Madrid to Barcelona July 14, 2019 â¬120m Barcelona to Atletico Madrid August 31, 2021 â¬10m (loan fee) Barcelona to Atletico Madrid July 1, 2023 â¬20m (upcoming) Philippe Coutinho has had a very odd career. Without reaching the heights predicted in his youth, the trigger-happy Brazilian has still achieved plenty. He has had money paid for him on five occasions, and one of them was the record sale of a Premier League player. He still has time to achieve more at his current home, Aston Villa. Transfer Date Fee Vasco U17 to Inter July 23, 2008 â¬3.8m Inter to Liverpool January 30, 2013 â¬13m Liverpool to Barcelona January 8, 2018 â¬135m Barcelona to Bayern Munich August 19, 2019 â¬8.5m (loan fee) Barcelona to Aston Villa July 1, 2022 â¬20m The hardest quiz question in football: Who does Alvaro Morata currently belong to?  The Spanish striker has been bouncing around a handful of big teams for years and to be fair, he has generally managed to score goals at every club he has played for. Money has been spent on him six times, and he is likely not far away from another move soon. Transfer Date Fee Real Madrid to Juventus July 19, 2014 â¬20m Juventus to Real Madrid July 1, 2016 â¬30m Real Madrid to Chelsea July 21, 2017 â¬66m Chelsea to Atletico Madrid January 28, 2019 â¬18m (loan fee) Chelsea to Atletico Madrid July 1, 2020 â¬35m Atletico Madrid to Juventus September 22, 2020 â¬20m (loan fee) He had to feature. There are two moves in particular that take Ronaldo to third on this list and one of them made him the most expensive player in the world for a short while. Ronaldo has been purchased on four different occasions, although his figure is now likely to stay the same given he is at Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia. Transfer Date Fee Sporting to Manchester United August 12, 2003 â¬19m Manchester United to Real Madrid July 6, 2009 â¬94m Real Madrid to Juventus July 10, 2018 â¬117m Juventus to Manchester United August 31, 2021 â¬17m The most expensive player in the world is not even at the top of the list. It is incredible really, but Neymar has only moved twice in his career so far. He is so high on the list because the two moves in question have been absolute whoppers. Transfer Date Fee Santos to Barcelona July 1, 2013 â¬88m Barcelona to PSG August 3, 2017 â¬222m Romelu Lukaku is not going to go down as one of the absolute greats of football, but he finds himself at the top of this list. He can be a devastatingly effective forward when the conditions are right for him, but his dips in form are too frequent.  That is part of why he is top of this list, as he has never quite settled anywhere. That being said, his level has always been high enough that he is worth paying a handsome fee for. Transfer Date Fee Anderlecht to Chelsea August 8, 2011 â¬15m Chelsea to Everton September 2, 2013 â¬3m (loan fee) Chelsea to Everton July 30, 2014 â¬35.36m Everton to Manchester United July 10, 2017 â¬84.7m Manchester United to Inter August 8, 2019 â¬74m Inter to Chelsea August 12, 2021 â¬113m Chelsea to Inter"
Liverpool agree to send Fabio Carvalho on loan to Bundesliga,"Jun 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-agree-fabio-carvalho-loan-bundesliga,"Liverpool have agreed to send young midfielder Fabio Carvalho on loan to RB Leipzig next season, 90min understands. The 20-year-old joined from Fulham last summer and managed 21 appearances across all competitions during his first season at Anfield. He was a regular feature in the squad to start the season but was afforded just 11 minutes of Premier League action from November onwards. A loan move for this season has been on the cards for a while now but, as 90min revealed in April, the idea of a permanent departure was firmly ruled out. Sources have confirmed that Liverpool have rejected a permanent offer from Leipzig but have agreed to a straight loan deal which does not include an option or obligation to buy for the German side. Liverpool want Carvalho back at the club ahead of the 2024/25 campaign and have ensured they remain in control of the former Fulham starlet's future. feed Liverpool officials are understood to have been keen to keep Carvalho for the upcoming pre-season to give manager Jurgen Klopp chance to make a decision on his immediate future, but the 20-year-old wanted to get his future resolved as soon as possible and is now set to head to Germany for the coming year. Deployed both as a midfielder and a left winger under Klopp, Carvalho has seen Liverpool strengthen in both positions since his arrival. Cody Gakpo and Darwin Nunez have added to the competition out wide, while Alexis Mac Allister has agreed to move to Anfield this summer to bolster in midfield. The Reds remain keen to add another fresh face in midfield. Nice's Khephren Thuram and Borussia Monchengladbach's Manu Kone have both been discussed, and interest remains in unsettled Bayern Munich youngster Ryan Gravenberch."
Man Utd enter Andre Onana talks with David de Gea exit increasingly likely,"Jun 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-andre-onana-talks-david-de-gea-exit,"David de Gea is increasingly likely to leave Manchester United when his contract expires at the end of June, and the club are preparing for this possibility by pursuing a move for Inter's Andre Onana, 90min understands. The Red Devils are continuing negotiations with the Spaniard over a new deal having previously been close to an agreement on fresh terms. De Gea turned down a lucrative move to Saudi Arabia earlier in June in order to thrash out the formalities of a new contract at Old Trafford, but he is more likely than ever to leave United at the end of the month. 90min reported on Tuesday that United were actively looking at the goalkeeper market as talks with De Gea rumbled on, with Porto's Diogo Costa and Brentford's David Raya among their targets. Another name on their radar was Onana, who worked under manager Erik ten Hag at Ajax, and sources have revealed to 90min that the club have held talks with the player's camp in recent days. United have also been in touch with Inter and have been informed that it would take a total fee of â¬60m to get him out of San Siro this transfer window - Chelsea had previously been in talks with Inter over Onana but were put off by the asking price. feed If United follow through with a move for Onana, it would represent a drastic change of their summer transfer plans. They had banked on De Gea staying and then signing a cheaper alternative to challenge him for the starting spot, but if the 32-year-old departs then they will be forced to splash out on a ready-made replacement. 90min previously revealed that United had hoped young goalkeeper Matej Kovar would provide the needed competition for De Gea following an impressive loan spell at Sparta Prague. Sources have told 90min that United watched Empoli goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario at points last season, but he is set to move to Premier League rivals Tottenham."
Man Utd handed boost in Rasmus Hojlund pursuit as Atalanta line up replacement,"Jun 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-boost-rasmus-hojlund-pursuit-atalanta-replacement,"Atalanta are in talks over a deal for Almeria striker El Bilal Toure, who is being lined up to replace Manchester United target Rasmus Hojlund, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 21-year-old Mali international joined Almeria from Reims last year and played a pivotal role in keeping them in La Liga. Despite injuries hampering him, Toure claimed seven goals from 21 games, including the winner goal in their a win against title-winners Barcelona. He is now set to move again, with Atalanta opening talks over a â¬25m deal, although there is rival interest from Serie A winners Napoli. 90min also understands that Everton are keen to launch a bid for Toure, but they are not in a position at this moment to match Atalanta's offer. feed Atalanta have made their move for Toure as 90min understands that the club have already accepted that Hojlund will leave this summer. Hojlund, who has emerged as one of Man Utd's top striker targets this transfer window, has already informed Atalanta that he is looking to leave and he is set to get his wish. Aside from Man Utd, sources have told 90min that Inter, Napoli and Juventus have all registered an interest with Atalanta. Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain have also held talks with the player's representatives in recent months. Hojlund scored 10 goals and added four assists in 34 games in his debut season for Atalanta."
Man Utd hopeful of agreeing Mason Mount fee with Chelsea after third bid submitted,"Jun 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-hopeful-agreeing-mason-mount-fee-chelsea,"Manchester United believe their third offer for Mason Mount will be deemed acceptable by Chelsea, 90min understands. Mount is entering the final 12 months of his current contract at Stamford Bridge, and has declined contract extension offers from the club, thus opening the door to a potential move this summer. Sources have told 90min that the England international has agreed personal terms with Man Utd, and now the Red Devils are attempting to strike a deal with Chelsea in order to get the deal over the line. The Blues recently rejected an opening bid worth Â£40m and a follow up bid of Â£50m from Man Utd for the midfielder. Chelsea had initially demanded Â£70m for Mount, but sources have confirmed that they would be willing to accept a bid of Â£60m-Â£65m. feed 90min understands that a third bid has arrived worth an initial Â£50m plus a further Â£5m in add-ons, which still falls short of Chelsea's valuation. United believe this offer to be more than fair for a player in Mount's situation and have threatened to walk away from negotiations if this latest bid is rejected. Man Utd manager Erik ten Hag is a huge fan of the player and is pushing hard to get a deal finalised, seeing Mount as a key part of his plans at Old Trafford moving forward. "
Tottenham concerned by rival interest in Edmond Tapsoba,"Jun 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-concerned-rival-interest-edmond-tapsoba,"Tottenham Hotspur are progressing in talks with Bayer Leverkusen defender Edmond Tapsoba but are wary he is a target for several other clubs, sources have told 90min. Spurs are on the hunt for at least one new centre-back in the summer transfer window following a disastrous Premier League campaign in which they conceded 63 goals - only Bournemouth, Nottingham Forest and the three relegated clubs had worse records. Among Tottenham's targets are Manchester United captain Harry Maguire, Manchester City's Aymeric Laporte and Wolves' Max Kilman. However, they are currently pursuing a deal for 24-year-old Tapsoba, who impressed Spurs scouts during previous visits to watch teammate Piero Hincapie. 90min understands Tapsoba's representatives have signalled he is willing to move to Tottenham and they are in talks with the club over a transfer, but Spurs are not the only team in the race. feed Liverpool, Manchester United and Newcastle United are eyeing new centre-backs and have been informed of Tapsoba's situation. Arsenal have also followed the Burkina Faso international closely but are pushing ahead with a move for Ajax's Jurrien Timber instead. West Ham are set to appoint Tim Steidten, who previously worked for Leverkusen, as their new technical director and could also make their interest known. Unlike Spurs, the Hammers would be able to offer Tabsopa the prospect of European football next season. Another centre-back on Tottenham's radar is Marc Guehi, but 90min understands they have been put off by Crystal Palace's Â£60m asking price and so are currently looking at other targets. A similar situation occurred in Spurs' pursuit of a new goalkeeper. They identified David Raya as their top target but were unwilling to meet Brentford's Â£40m asking price, with Empoli's Guglielmo Vicario set to join for roughly half that sum instead."
Bernardo Silva offered monster contract to join Saudi Pro League,"Jun 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bernardo-silva-monster-contract-saudi-pro-league,"Bernardo Silva has been offered a huge contract to follow in the footsteps of Karim Benzema, N'Golo Kante and others by joining the Saudi Pro League, 90min understands. The 28-year-old has signalled his intention to leave Manchester City this summer in search of a new challenge, having won every competition available to him after last season's treble. Silva is under contract at the Etihad Stadium until 2025 and remains a hugely influential figure for Pep Guardiola - his importance was highlighted by a brace of goals for City against Real Madrid in their Champions League semi-final second leg encounter. 90min understands that City are willing to facilitate an exit this summer providing they receive an offer of around Â£75m for Silva, which wouldn't be a problem for the cash-rich Saudi Pro League. And sources have told 90min that Silva has received a contract offer from the Middle East worth around Â£80m-a-year - an astonishing figure that could earn him the equivalent of Â£220,000-a-day. manual But despite the riches on offer to Silva and many others, 90min further understands that his current preference is to stay and compete in Europe. Barcelona is his ideal destination and the player's camp have held talks with La Blaugrana about a potential transfer. But it's unlikely the club will be able to raise the funds needed to pry him away from City, leaving Paris Saint-Germain leading the chase for Silva. The Ligue 1 giants are willing to meet City's price tag and have the financial firepower to offer him a wage increase on what he's earning in Manchester.  Silva has held productive talks with sporting advisor Luis Campos but will only make a decision on his future once he knows who is succeeding Christophe Galtier as the club's head coach - Luis Enrique is the candidate PSG hope to now appoint after talks with Julian Nagelsmann fell through. The Portuguese international has prior experience of playing in Ligue 1 following a three-year stint with Monaco. He was part of the young side that toppled PSG and won the French title in 2017, earning him a Â£43.5m move to City."

Guerreiro allowed his contract at Signal-Iduna Park to expire this summer and he was heavily courted by several sides across Europe. 90min reported back in March that he had several suitors from the Premier League, with the likes of Newcastle United and Aston Villa interested in him. But Guerreiro has made the decision to join BVB's fierce foes Bayern, linking up with former boss Thomas Tuchel at the Allianz Arena. ""When the call came from FC Bayern, my decision was made quickly,"" Guerreiro said to Bayern's club channels. ""It's an honour for me to play for this big club and I also really appreciate Thomas Tuchel from our time together at Dortmund. ""I'm a player who always likes to have the ball - it's about dominating the game and I want to create chances. I will do everything to win as many titles as possible. That is the philosophy of FC Bayern."" feed Guerreiro leaves Dortmund having been beaten to the Bundesliga title in agonising fashion by Bayern on the last day of the 2022/23 season. BVB led the table by two points but with an inferior goal difference and could only manage a 2-2 draw at home to Mainz - Guerreiro won his side a first-half penalty, which was missed by Sebastien Haller - while Bayern left it late to beat Koln 2-1 and secure an 11th-straight championship."
Tottenham schedule Guglielmo Vicario medical amid Serie A interest,"Jun 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-schedule-guglielmo-vicario-medical-amid-serie-a-interest,"Tottenham Hotspur are looking to wrap up the signing of Guglielmo Vicario quickly amid fears of late rival bids from Serie A sides, 90min understands. Spurs have spent recent months identifying goalkeeper targets and finding potential long-term successors to club captain Hugo Lloris, who has admitted he wants to leave for a new challenge this summer. 90min reported earlier in June that Brentford's David Raya was their top target and personal terms were not an issue, but the Bees' insistence that the Spain international would not be sold for less than Â£40m proved to be an insurmountable stumbling block for Tottenham. They began looking at other targets at the start of this week and quickly settled on 26-year-old Vicario, who broke into Italy's senior setup last season and is viewed as one of Serie A's finest goalkeepers. Tottenham have agreed a â¬20m fee with Empoli and Vicario is set to fly to London to undergo a medical, but sources have told 90min that Spurs are wary that there could be another twist in this transfer race. Inter and Milan are both admirers of Vicario and are in similar positions where their current goalkeepers - Andre Onana and Mike Maignan respectively - could leave this window. feed As such, Tottenham are attempting to push through a deal for Vicario, who is in line to become their second signing under new head coach Ange Postecoglou following Dejan Kulusevski's permanent move. Speaking to Lady Radio on Thursday, Empoli president Fabrizio Corsi admitted that he was proud to see Vicario taking such a big step in his career. ""We bought him back to sell him on. We also paid a lot to sign him considering our finances,"" he said. ""It's a source of pride for us that the top teams have him in their sights. He's also a special person, not just as a footballer."""

Transfer notebook: Brentford finalising Â£25m deal for Nathan Collins,"Jun 22, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/transfer-notebook-brentford-25m-deal-nathan-collins,"Brentford are on the verge of agreeing a deal worth Â£25m for Republic of Ireland international Nathan Collins. The 22-year-old has been unable to command a regular starting berth at Wolves since Julen Lopetegui took charge and will be allowed to move to the GTech Community Stadium this summer. The Bees are looking to fill the void left by Pontus Jansson's departure at the end of his contract and Thomas Frank looks to have moved early to find his replacement. Brighton are hoping to complete the signing of Anderlecht goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen in the coming days. The 20-year-old goalkeeper has been tipped as one of the game's brightest young stoppers and was a target for Premier League new boys Burnley. But with Roberto De Zerbi's Seagulls able to offer European football next season, the Dutchman looks to be heading to the Amex Stadium to compete with Jason Steele for a starting berth. Robert Sanchez has been told he can leave Brighton, meanwhile, after falling out of favour towards the back end of last season. Everton have confirmed the departure of Tom Davies after he turned down a new contract at the club. The 24-year-old played 179 games for the Toffees in all competitions but has struggled with injuries after bursting onto the scene as a teenager during 2016/17. Davies is expected to head abroad to join Serie A outfit Monza - his first venture away from Merseyside. Marcus Thuram, who is leaving Borussia Monchengladbach as a free agent, is close to finalising terms with Serie A giants AC Milan.

Newcastle seal agreement with AC Milan for Sandro Tonali,"Jun 22, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/newcastle-seal-agreement-ac-milan-sandro-tonali,"Newcastle United have reached agreement with AC Milan over midfielder Sandro Tonali, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Magpies dispatched sporting director Dan Ashworth and chief scout Steve Nickson to Italy on Tuesday to push through a move and they are heading home from Milan with a deal in place. 90min previously confirmed that Tonali was open to moving to St James' Park after Newcastle made their initial move over the weekend - he has now agreed to sign a six-year contract after spending three years at San Siro. Tonali will now undergo a medical in Romania - where Italy are based for the European Under-21 Championships - before putting pen to paper on his contract. Sources close to Milan have told 90min that the overall deal is worth â¬70m (Â£60m) including add-ons - which would make Tonali Newcastle's second most expensive signing of all time, following on from last year's capture of Swedish forward Alexander Isak. Tonali will become Newcastle's first major signing of the summer as they aim to bring in another four new faces for manager Eddie Howe.  It is understood that on top of the Tonali deal, Newcastle want to sign a new right-sided central defender, a full-back, a wide forward and a number 10. They are hoping the latter will be James Maddison, who is also wanted by Tottenham, and talks have already taking place with Leicester about a prospective deal."
Bournemouth near second signing of the summer window,"Jun 22, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bournemouth-near-second-signing-summer-window,"Bournemouth are a step closer to securing their second signing of the summer after agreeing a fee with Roma for Justin Kluivert. 90min understands that the Cherries, who surprisingly dismissed Gary O'Neil in favour of hiring former Real Valladolid manager Andoni Iraola on Monday, have agreed a fee just shy of Â£11m, including add-ons, for the 24-year-old. Fulham, Crystal Palace and Everton had also shown interest in signing Kluivert, who had the option to stay at Roma and fight for his place, but it's Bournemouth where he will look to rebuild his career after three consecutive seasons out on loan. Kluivert, capped twice by the Netherlands, spent the 2022/23 campaign at Valencia after failing to force his way into the first team picture at Jose Mourinho's Roma. RB Leipzig and OGC Nice had been year-long landings prior to his most recent loan - a fate that few would have predicted after he moved to Italy in the summer of 2018 for a fee of just over Â£15m. feed Tipped as star of the future at the time, Kluivert has played just 53 times in Serie A for Roma - who have completed the signing of Eintracht Frankfurt defender Evan Ndicka ahead of Tottenham and Liverpool - after scoring ten goals for Ajax in his breakthrough Eredivisie season. Should his move to the south coast go through as expected, Kluivert will become Bournemouth's second signing of the summer. Hamed Traore's loan spell from Sassuolo has already been made permanent for Â£20m, despite the Ivory Coast international going seven games without a goal last season. In terms of outgoings, Bournemouth have released Jack Stacey and Junior Stanislas, while Jefferson Lerma has joined Crystal Palace at the end of his contract. Jordan Zemura has also left Bournemouth on a free transfer, joining Udinese in Serie A."
Manchester City to rival Arsenal with bid for Declan Rice,"Jun 22, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/manchester-city-rival-arsenal-bid-declan-rice,"Manchester City are ready to formalise their long-standing interest in West Ham captain Declan Rice with a bid, 90min understands. The seven-time Premier League winners have known for a long time that they may need to overhaul their midfield this summer, with the futures of Ilkay Gundogan, Bernardo Silva and Kalvin Phillips subject of intense speculation for a number of months. Captain Gundogan, who played a starring role as City won the treble last season, has come to the end of his contract at the Etihad Stadium and has opted to join Barcelona on a free transfer rather than renewing his deal in Manchester, while Silva has told the first-time Champions League winners that he'd like to move on amid interest from Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain. Phillips has not been a regular starter following his Â£42m move from Leeds and has actually been linked with a move to West Ham - potentially to replace Rice, who looks destined to move on this summer with just two years remaining on his contract. Arsenal have been leading the chase to sign Rice, submitting two bids to West Ham, and his preference is to remain in London. But they have been unable to agree a fee as the Hammers stand firm in their valuation and majority owner David Sullivan is adamant that he will not compromise on price - he is seeking a deal worth at least Â£100m plus add-ons. Sources have confirmed to 90min that City are now ready to act and have intimated to West Ham that a bid is forthcoming. Pep Guardiola's side certainly have the financial muscle to meet Rice's asking price, though there could be discussions about including Phillips in the deal despite his preference to stay and fight for his place. feed Indeed, West Ham's interest in Phillips dates back to his time at Leeds United, with the club making an unsuccessful bid of Â£50m in the 2022 January transfer window. Fulham's Joao Palhinha is another player of interest to the Europa Conference League-winning Hammers as they look for Rice alternatives, though their valuation of the Portuguese international may make a deal difficult to do. City are close to the completing of signing Mateo Kovacic from Premier League rivals Chelsea, but 90min understands that they do want to sign another midfielder on top. Bayern Munich's Joshua Kimmich is strongly admired but Rice is viewed as a far more realistic signing this summer as the Bundesliga giants do not to want to sell. Arsenal are expected to return with a third, vastly improved offer for Rice, while West Ham hope that a bidding war involving Manchester United will extract maximum value for the 24-year-old. The Red Devils also want to sign a central midfielder and know that West Ham have interest in Scott McTominay, who has recently starred for Scotland on international duty."
N'Golo Kante pens farewell letter to Chelsea after Al Ittihad move,"Jun 22, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/n-golo-kante-pens-farewell-letter-to-chelsea-after-al-ittihad-move,"N'Golo Kante has insisted he will 'never forget' the Chelsea fans that supported him for seven years following his move to Al Ittihad. The Frenchman has taken his talents to Saudi Arabia following the expiry of his Chelsea contract, bringing an end to a seven-year spell at Stamford Bridge which saw him win the Premier League, FA Cup, Champions League, Europa League, Super Cup and Club World Cup. Chelsea paid tribute to Kante in a farewell message and now the 32-year-old, who managed 269 appearances for the Blues, has now penned a letter of his own. ""Goodbye Chelsea,"" Kante wrote. ""The time has come to open a new chapter in my career. But before doing so, it was important for me to thank the great and wonderful Chelsea family. ""Fans, players, directors, coaches, members of the medical staff, everyone who has supported me over the last seven seasons with this legendary club. So many fond memories, so many victories, so many titles won at your side. ""Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Iâll never forget you. feed ""Iâd also like to thank my family, my close friends, who have always been by my side through good times and bad. Not forgetting my agent, Karim, and my advisers Rachid and Driss, who have been by my side with unfailing support since I started out. These last few months have not been easy for us and our families. But weâve managed to stick together in the face of rumours and lies. They too have played a major role in my success. ""See you soon on the pitch for new adventures with Al Ittihad and Les Bleus."" Kante leaves Chelsea as a hugely popular figure but one who saw injuries limit his time at Stamford Bridge. After avoiding any significant physical issues for his first three years in London, Kante managed just 22 Premier League appearances in the 2019/20 season and would never manage more than 30 in the years that followed. 2022/23 was particularly tough for Kante, who was restricted to just seven league outings after a hamstring injury cost him five months and a groin problem brought his campaign to an abrupt end."
Tottenham agree deal to sign Empoli goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario,"Jun 22, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-agree-deal-to-sign-empoli-goalkeeper-guglielmo-vicario,"Tottenham have agreed to meet Empoli's â¬20m asking price for goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario, 90min understands. Spurs had been keen to strike a deal for Brentford's David Raya but were reluctant to come anywhere close to the Bees' Â£40m asking price and have since turned their attention to Italy international Vicario. Empoli have asked for a fee of â¬20m to part ways with their goalkeeper, who joined them permanently last summer and kept seven clean sheets in 31 Serie A appearances, and sources have confirmed to 90min that Spurs are happy to strike a deal at that price. Numerous Italian sides have been looking at Vicario, with Inter previously seen as favourites to land the 26-year-old as their replacement for the in-demand Andre Onana, but Spurs have moved quickly to try and fend off the competition. Talks have already been held between Spurs and Vicario, who is understood to be ready to move to England this summer. feed Vicario is now expected to arrive and take the place of Hugo Lloris, who has one year left on his contract but has confirmed his desire to leave Spurs in the coming weeks. Strengthening in goal has been a top priority this summer for Spurs and they had hoped to lure Raya across London, but Brentford stood firm on their Â£40m asking price, despite the fact the Spaniard has just one year remaining on his contract. Raya, who has also been linked with the likes of Chelsea and Manchester United, recently admitted he was concerned his high price tag could prevent him from leaving this summer. Finding a cheaper goalkeeper will afford Spurs more flexibility in pursuit of other targets. Leicester midfielder James Maddison is high on the wish list but has been hit with a huge Â£60m asking price."

Liverpool given Saudi Pro League warning over Mohamed Salah,"Jun 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-given-saudi-pro-league-warning-over-mohamed-salah,"Saudi Arabian football official Hafez Al-Medlej has called on the Saudi Pro League to âstart working on the signingâ of Liverpool superstar Mohamed Salah, in addition to Manchester Cityâs Bernardo Silva, as the country continues its assault on European football. Cristiano Ronaldo kicked off the Saudi Pro Leagueâs ambitious surge in late December when he joined Al-Nassr. Karim Benzema and NâGolo Kante have since traded Europe for Al-Ittihad, while Ruben Neves in the verge of joining Al-Hilal, the same club that made an offer to Lionel Messi. Chelsea pair Hakim Ziyech and Kalidou Kouliably are in talks to be next, on course to join Al-Nassr and Al-Hilal respectively, and could be followed by Stamford Bridge colleagues Edouard Mendy and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang should further talks prove successful. Saudi Arabiaâs Public Investment Fund (PIF), the same group that is Newcastleâs majority shareholder, recently took control of the leagueâs four biggest clubs, suggesting that the stream of huge investment is not going to slow down any time soon. Al-Medlej is a former head of AFCâs marketing committee, having also been an executive board member with the confederation, head of marketing of the Saudi Pro League from 2008 until 2014 and a board member of the Saudi Arabian Football Federation for 13 years. ""All transferable footballers will from now on be targeted by Saudi clubs,"" he told Koura, going on to insist that the Saudi Pro League boom will not fizzle out like the Chinese Super League famously did. feed ""The experience of China has nothing to do with us, theirs was purely marketing,â Al-Medlej added. ""Soccer there is not the most popular. In Arabia we have a state project and it will not be limited to four great teams, but to all of them. Because the passion for football of the Saudis has no limits. ""We do not hire players who are already finished. Al-Hilal is going to sign Ruben Neves, who is 26 years old and who Barcelona wanted. And Benzema has already arrived at Al-Ittihad after being crowned the Ballon d'Or with Real Madrid, who is faced with the dilemma of replacing him."" ""The departure of the big stars from Europe will be a hard blow for the Champions League and the tournament will lose much of its brilliance. We have an example in La Liga. They lost a lot with the transfer of Ronaldo to Juventus. And then they lost more when Messi went to Paris Saint-Germain. ""The departure of the stars from Europe will affect sponsorship and television contracts. Messi is the best footballer at the moment and his incorporation would have provided great value. But we are not going to compensate him with a substitute player. ""Let's hope that Bernardo Silva, from Manchester City, arrives. We must also start working on the signing of Mohamed Salah since he is overwhelmingly popular in the Arab world and in Europe. I think Salah still has records to break with Liverpool, so I hope if he doesnât come now, he will in the future."""

Newcastle progressing with Sandro Tonali talks,"Jun 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/newcastle-progressing-sandro-tonali-talks,"Newcastle United are progressing with talks to land AC Milan midfielder Sandro Tonali, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 23-year-old Italy international has emerged as Newcastle's top defensive midfield target and they are moving ahead a deal after the player's camp communicated his interest in making the move. Previous interest in Nicolo Barella at city rivals Inter cooled after it emerged he was not looking to head to the Premier League, leaving Tonali to emerge as the man they want. Tonali is considered with of Italy's best defensive midfielders and is captaining his country at the European Under-21 Championship being staged in Georgia and Romania. Tonali still has four years left on the Milan contract he signed in 2022, but Newcastle are ready to offer him a significant pay rise should he put pen to paper on Tyneside. feed With Tonali giving the green light, talks have quickly progressed since Tuesday and 90min understands that Magpies director of football Dan Ashworth is currently in Italy to oversee a possible deal as the two clubs are now talking over the terms of a transfer.

West Ham still keen on Man Utd midfielder amid Declan Rice rumours,"Jun 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-still-keen-man-utd-midfielder-declan-rice-rumours,"West Ham United remain interested in signing Scott McTominay from Manchester United, 90min understands, but a transfer is unlikely to hinge on Declan Rice's future. The Hammers are preparing to lose Rice this summer after he led them to Europa Conference League final glory in June, but will not sanction a move unless any interested party is willing to offer a package worth over Â£100m. Arsenal have seen two bids for Rice rejected by West Ham, the last of which is believed to have been worth Â£90m - broken into Â£75m in guaranteed money with Â£15m in additional add-ons. The Gunners are expected to return with a third offer for West Ham's captain, knowing they must up the ante because of the latter's frustration with how negotiations have gone so far. Rice's preference is to remain in London but he is very much still a target for both Manchester City and Manchester United, the latter of whom are looking to strengthen in the middle of the park ahead of a return to next season's Champions League. Reports elsewhere have suggested that United may look to use McTominay or Harry Maguire as a bargaining chip in a move for Rice, but 90min understands that any potential transfers away from Old Trafford for those two are unlikely to be as a result of being included in a swap deal. Indeed, Rice is still likely to join Arsenal at this stage - personal terms on a contract worth in excess of Â£200,000-a-week are all but agreed - and his desire to remain in the capital could see Chelsea re-enter the running should West Ham fail to agree terms with the Gunners over a fee. feed West Ham are keen on signing both McTominay and Maguire in isolation, with their interest in the former dating back to the beginning of last season, when Erik ten Hag bolstered United's midfield options with the signing of Casemiro. David Moyes is a huge fan of 26-year-old Scotland international in particular, with his dynamism and energy in midfield likely to appeal given West Ham's increasing match workload. Newcastle are also interested in signing McTominay but they're looking at boosting their midfield with a couple of high-profile additions - AC Milan's Sandro Tonali the latest target for the Magpies after initial interest was shown in Inter's Nicolo Barella - and that could see the Scot left out in the cold once final decisions have to be made. Maguire is another player that Moyes is appreciative of and it's no secret that United are willing to let their captain move on this summer. 90min revealed in April that the 30-year-old was open to moving to Serie A on loan, while Tottenham have also registered him as one of their top defensive targets."

Juventus waiting on Adrien Rabiot decision amid continued Man Utd interest,"Jun 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/juventus-adrien-rabiot-decision-man-utd-interest,"Juventus are still trying to persuade Adrien Rabiot to stay at the club despite interest from Manchester United, 90min understands.  Rabiot was one of the standout performers in Serie A during the 2022/23 campaign, bagging a career-high 11 goals in all competitions and becoming a firm fan favourite at the Allianz Stadium after being the opposite in years prior.  The French midfielder's performances were all the more remarkable given they came in the final season of his contract at Juventus, with speculation rife over a potential move elsewhere. Manchester United have long been interested in Rabiot's services and that remains the case, but sources have confirmed to 90min that Liverpool, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur are not as keen on a deal as they once were. Old Trafford remains a viable landing spot for Rabiot - particularly if he confirms his intention to leave Turin - but with a lack of substantial offers on the table, 90min understands that Juventus are confident they can tie the 28-year-old down to a new contract. They are even willing to offer a one-year extension if that's what it takes to get a deal agreed. feed Another option is also emerging for Rabiot as interest from Saudi Arabia has been confirmed to 90min. Karim Benzema, Cristiano Ronaldo and N'Golo Kante have all accepted mega money offers to play in the Saudi Pro League, with a number of the country's top clubs now bankrolled by the Public Investment Fund (PIF) - the owners of Newcastle United and investors in Chelsea's Todd-Boehly led Clearlake Capital consortium. Ruben Neves, Kalidou Koulibaly and Hakim Ziyech are expected to follow suit in the coming days, while Rabiot's Juventus team-mate, Paul Pogba, has also been targeted for a move to the Middle East. Rabiot has been at Juventus for approaching four years after joining on a free transfer from Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain. He has also becoming an increasingly prominent player in France's midfield, playing a leading role in helping Didier Deschamps' side reach a second consecutive World Cup final last December."
Chelsea reject second Man Utd bid for Mason Mount,"Jun 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-reject-second-man-utd-bid-mason-mount,"Chelsea have rejected a second offer from Manchester United for Mason Mount, sources have confirmed to 90min. United launched their opening offer for Mount last week, but that bid worth Â£40m was rejected. Now, a second bid worth Â£50m has also been quickly rebuffed by Chelsea. The second offer was worth an initial Â£45m with Â£5m in add-ons, but that is still way short of Chelsea's valuation of Mount. Chelsea had initially demanded Â£70m for Mount, although sources close to the situation believe that they could be ready to drop to between Â£60m and Â£65m. That would still require United to raise their offer by at least another Â£10m, however. 90min understands that United boss Erik ten Hag is pushing his superiors hard to get a deal finalised for Mount, who he now sees as a hugely important part of their plans ahead of the new season. feed Despite the second bid being rejected quickly, the lines of communication between the two clubs remain open and a third offer is expected shortly. Chelsea had always hoped that Mount could yet be persuaded to extend his contract beyond its current expiry date of 2024, but even the appointment of Mauricio Pochettino as head coach has failed to lead to a breakthrough. It is believed that Chelsea are now accepting that there is too much 'bad blood' between the club and Mount's camp for him to commit to a new deal."
Arsenal agree deal to sign Kai Havertz from Chelsea,"Jun 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-agree-deal-to-sign-kai-havertz-from-chelsea,"Arsenal have agreed a deal worth in excess of Â£65m to sign Germany international Kai Havertz from Chelsea, 90min understands. 90min recently reported that the Gunners had entered talks with the Blues over a potential move for Havertz, with Chelsea keen to strike a deal worth over Â£70m in order to recoup the fee they initially shelled out to Bayer Leverkusen in 2020. Sources have confirmed that Arsenal have, however, been successful in negotiating a lower fee despite Chelsea's initial adamancy that they would not accept less than Â£70m. 90min understands that a deal worth over Â£65m overall has been accepted by the Blues. Havertz is set to become one of the highest paid players at the Emirates Stadium, alongside Bukayo Saka, once the deal is finalised. feed Havertz had previously been of interest to Bayern Munich and Real Madrid in recent weeks, with the former recently initiating talks with the forward's representatives. Real Madrid backed away from any potential deal in early June due to concerns over Chelsea's asking price for the German. The forward will join the Gunners following a rather inconsistent three-year stint at Stamford Bridge. Havertz scored 19 goals in the Premier League for Chelsea, but he will be most fondly remembered for his UEFA Champions League-winning goal against Manchester City in the 2021 final. "
Barcelona set to finalise Ilkay Gundogan deal,"Jun 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-set-to-finalise-ilkay-gundogan-deal,"Barcelona are set to confirm the signing of Ilkay Gundogan, sources have told 90min. The 32-year-old midfielder has been in talks with Barca since the turn of the year and a move to Camp Nou was always believed to have been his favoured option. Gundogan finished the season in fine form, playing a huge part in City completing the Treble.  City offered him the chance to remain at the Etihad Stadium but, after nine seasons in England, Gundogan has decided to join Barca - a decision which he confirmed to Pep Guardiola and the club's hierarchy after the Champions League final win over Inter. Sources close to Gundogan have always insisted that finances have not been a key factor in the deal, but based around his family. Gundogan has agreed what could become a three-year deal with Barca, although the final year is an option. Barcelona included the signing of Gundogan in their financial viability plans that were approved by La Liga earlier this month and once he puts pen-to-paper, there should be no issues with his contract being registered. Barca finally saw the new contract for midfield star Gavi approved earlier this week. The move gives Gundogan the chance to play for Xavi - someone who he has previously described as one of his heroes."
Man City confident of signing Josko Gvardiol from RB Leipzig,"Jun 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-city-confident-signing-josko-gvardiol-rb-leipzig,"Manchester City are continuing talks with RB Leipzig over Josko Gvardiol and are confident of reaching an agreement to sign the defender, 90min understands. The 21-year-old has announced himself as one of Europe's best young centre-backs over the last couple of years, particularly impressing in the Bundesliga after moving from Dinamo Zagreb in 2021. 90min reported last August that Chelsea were in talks with RB Leipzig over a â¬90m deal that would have seen Gvardiol join a year later, but the two parties were unable to find an agreement. After putting in some superb performances during Croatia's run to the 2022 World Cup semi-finals, Gvardiol became a hot topic of transfer conversation once more, with 90min first revealing in December 2022 that Manchester City had held talks over a move. City recently made plans to firm up their interest in Gvardiol and they are now in active talks with Leipzig over a deal. A stumbling block in negotiations is Leipzig's â¬100m asking price, which City are adamant they will not meet. Nevertheless, there is a confidence in the camp of the seven-time Premier League winners that an agreement will be reached. feed In addition to City, Gvardiol remains a player admired by Real Madrid, though they have already spent a nine-figure sum on Jude Bellingham this window. Gvardiol was part of the Leipzig side that lost 7-0 to City in the second leg of their Champions League last 16 tie back in March, but his arrival at the Etihad would reinforce a defence that has added three centre-back signings over the last three summer transfer windows.  Ruben Dias and Nathan Ake joined in 2020 from Benfica and Bournemouth respectively, while Manuel Akanji proved to be one of the signings of the season when joining from Borussia Dortmund in 2022 for a fee of just Â£15m. City hoping to move on Aymeric Laporte - once the club's record signing at Â£57m - who is wanted by Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur."

The Croatia midfielder has one year left to run on his contract at Stamford Bridge and he has been the subject of interest from various Premier League clubs. 90min reported earlier this year that Liverpool and Manchester United were eyeing a summer move for Kovacic. However, Man City soon emerged as the favourites to sign the 29-year-old, with 90min revealing at the beginning of June they had agreed personal terms. And sources have now confirmed that Man City have agreed a deal with Chelsea that will see them pay a fee that could rise to Â£30m if add-ons are met. Kovacic will now undertake a medical ahead of sealing his move to the Etihad Stadium. feed He will become the second senior midfielder to leave Chelsea this summer, with N'Golo Kante's move to Saudi Pro League champions Al Ittihad confirmed on Wednesday morning. The Blues could also lose Mason Mount, who like Kovacic is entering the final year of his contract in west London. Man Utd are interested but have had an opening Â£40m bid knocked back. Kai Havertz is also expected to leave Chelsea, with Arsenal and Bayern Munich interested in his signature. Meanwhile, Man City are still waiting on Ilkay Gundogan's decision over his future.

He first joined the club in 2014 and has since enjoyed year after year of success in Spain's capital. Kroos has played 417 matches for Real since leaving Bayern, winning four Champions Leagues alongside three La Liga titles and other domestic and European honours.  He formed one of the greatest midfield partnerships with Casemiro - who left last year for Manchester United - and fellow stalwart Luka Modric, who is also expected to stay for another year despite heavy interest from Saudi Arabia. Kroos' fresh deal is further good news for manager Carlo Ancelotti, who has a lot of options in midfield for the 2023/24 season. feed Jude Bellingham has arrived from Borussia Dortmund in one of the biggest deals of the summer, while Aurelien Tchouameni and Eduardo Camavinga have also arrived in recent years with Real. Federico Valverde has developed into one of the best midfielders in the world and Dani Ceballos was also given plenty of game time last season. It'll be a new-look Real team elsewhere with Karim Benzema departing for Saudi Arabian champions Al Ittihad. Marco Asensio and Mariano Diaz left at the end of their contracts and Eden Hazard was released a year early. Brahim Diaz has returned from his AC Milan loan and signed a two-year contract, while striker Joselu has arrived temporary with the option of a permanent deal next year."

Manchester City remain undecided on Kalvin Phillips future,"Jun 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/manchester-city-remain-undecided-kalvin-phillips-future,"Manchester City remain undecided as to whether Kalvin Phillips will remain at the club next season, 90min understands. Phillips joined City last summer in Â£45m deal from Leeds United, but having arrived with an injury he was never able to make a major impact on the season. He was limited to just two Premier League starts all season, with both form and fitness playing a part in limiting his minutes. Despite his struggles for game time, Phillips has thus far had little threat to his place in the England squad, having been picked for the World Cup finals in Qatar and the most recent Euro 2024 qualifiers, which saw him score in the thrashing of North Macedonia. However, sources have told 90min that Three Lions chief Gareth Southgate has told Phillips that he cannot afford a repeat of this season if he wants to retain his place ahead of the European finals next summer. City are also believed to be far from certain that Phillips is a genuine fit for their squad, and there could yet be part of their plan to move him on. There are several clubs interested in Phillips should he decide that he does need to leave. West Ham, who are looking for Declan Rice's replacement ahead of his imminent move away from the club, are known admirers of Phillips, while Newcastle are also believed to been keeping a close eye on the situation. feed As it stands, however, Phillips insists he is not looking to leave the treble winners. ""I cannot give it 12 months and say I am not playing so I am going to leave, my intention is to stay there. We have just won the treble, so there is no reason for me to leave,"" Phillips told the media. ""To be honest I was injured before I even went to City, so that is one of the main reasons why I was injured so much.  ""I came to Manchester City to win trophies and we won the trophies, but I didn't play as much as I wanted to do. ""[City teammates] all said the first 12 months were the hardest of their City careers but after that, it doesn't become easy, but easier. ""I'm just going to go away for the off-season and enjoy myself with my family and girlfriend and friends and then come back fighting. ""I will definitely speak to Pep [Guardiola].

Pep Guardiola rejects Xavi's claims over blocked Joao Cancelo transfer,"Jun 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/pep-guardiola-rejects-xavi-claims-blocked-joao-cancelo-transfer,"Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola believes Barcelona counterpart Xavi was 'misinformed' over his claims about a failed pursuit of Joao Cancelo in January. Cancelo joined Bayern Munich on a six-month loan from City but Xavi claimed that Barcelona had actually agreed to sign the Portugal full-back before their move was blocked by the Premier League and Champions League winners. Asked about Xavi's comments, Guardiola denied having any contact with Barcelona over Cancelo's future and admitted they would have done business with any club just to get the full-back out of the squad. ""He has been misinformed,"" Guardiola said of Xavi. ""He is far from reality.  ""We decided that Joao had to leave and we didn't care where, [even] if he wanted to go to Manchester United, who are the city rivals. feed ""I'm not saying Xavi was lied to, but I'm saying he was misinformed. Joao went to Bayern because Bayern wanted him.

Kim, one of the stand-out defenders in Europe last season, has a â¬50m release clause in his contract which becomes active in July and has rejected the offer of a new deal in Naples which would remove that clause. Manchester United have long been trying to win the race for Kim's signature but progress in negotiations with the 26-year-old's entourage has been slow, allowing Bayern to join the race. Bayern quickly voiced a willingness to trigger Kim's release clause and set about negotiating a contract with the South Korean, and sources have confirmed to 90min that the German side are close to getting a deal done. Indeed, Napoli believe Kim is set to join Bayern and are now waiting for his release clause to be triggered early next month. feed United remain in talks with Kim's entourage but have not made any real progress over the past week, with the belief now that the centre-back is heading to Germany. Bayern have targeted Kim as they brace for interest in French international Lucas Hernandez, who has agreed personal terms with Paris Saint-Germain. President Herbert Hainer recently confirmed Bayern's desire to keep Lucas but, given he is approaching the final year of his contract, refused to rule out a sale. With Kim now expected to head to Germany, Man Utd will have to look elsewhere and have a number of alternative targets under consideration, including Leeds' Robin Koch and Monaco's Axel Disasi.

Arsenal in talks with Southampton over midfielder Romeo Lavia,"Jun 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-talks-southampton-midfielder-romeo-lavia,"Arsenal have held talks with Southampton over midfielder Romeo Lavia, 90min understands. The Gunners remain locked in negotiations with West Ham over first-choice target Declan Rice, for whom a Â£90m bid was recently rejected, but there are plans to add at least one other midfielder as well. Moises Caicedo is strongly admired by Arsenal but Brighton's near Â£100m asking price has seen the club look in another direction, namely towards Belgian teenager Lavia. Sources have confirmed to 90min that talks have been held over a move for the 19-year-old, who was a stand-out performer for Southampton last season and has no shortage of teams keen to offer him the chance to remain in the Premier League. Indeed, Chelsea are long-time admirers of Lavia through Blues director Joe Shields, who recruited Lavia during his time at Manchester City and also played a role in the midfielder's move to Southampton last summer. Shields has ensured that Chelsea remain informed on Lavia, but as it stands, the Blues are prioritising other targets and are pushing to strike a deal for Caicedo. feed Liverpool, Manchester United and Newcastle are all interested in recruiting Lavia but, like Chelsea, have other priorities at this moment. However, the mounting interest in Lavia's services could spark some of his suitors into life. Southampton accept that they are set to lose Lavia but are prepared to wait until they receive the right offer for his services. The Saints had been asking for Â£50m before their relegation from the Premier League but are now expected to accept slightly less. As part of his sale to Southampton, Manchester City also secured a buy-back clause for Lavia worth around Â£40m, but that clause is only valid for the summer of 2024 and would be wiped out if the midfielder moves clubs this year."

Son Heung-min rejects Saudi Arabia offer,"Jun 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/son-heung-min-rejects-saudi-arabia-offer,"Son Heung-min has confirmed he would rather remain in the Premier League than accept the riches on offer in Saudi Arabia. The Tottenham winger is one of many targets for Saudi Arabian officials, with offers both for this summer and in 2024 reported to be on the cards. However, Son has put an end to any uncertainty, making it abundantly clear that the level of competition in the Premier League is more valuable than any money on offer in the Saudi Pro League. ""Right now, money is not important to me,"" Son confirmed. ""The most important thing is to play in a league that I enjoy playing in.  ""I have so much more I want to accomplish in the Premier League. I absolutely love playing in the Premier League, so I want to prepare for the next season the best I can."" Son also quoted a past statement from former South Korean captain Ki Sung-yeung, who previously vowed never to play in another Asian league because of his love for his country. feed Son, whose current Tottenham contract runs until 2025, has used the international break to get an insight into life under new manager Ange Postecoglou, who managed South Korean teammate Oh Hyeon-gyu at Celtic. ""[Son] asked me about Ange's style - what he emphasises, his style of play,"" Oh revealed earlier this week. ""Iâve only played for Ange for half a year, but I already know that heâs tactically exceptional. I believe heâll succeed,"" Spurs will soon have to address Son's contract situation but their immediate priority is working with striker Harry Kane, whose deal has just 12 months left to run. 90min understands that Spurs are prepared to rebuff all interest in their talisman as they remain confident they can convince Kane to sign a new contract next season."
Leicester standing firm on James Maddison asking price in talks with Newcastle & Tottenham,"Jun 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/leicester-standing-firm-james-maddison-asking-price-talks-newcastle-tottenham,"Leicester City are continuing to demand Â£60m for Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur transfer target James Maddison, sources have told 90min. The Foxes were relegated from the Premier League on the final day of the 2022/23 season despite Maddison returning to form during the campaign, registering ten goals and nine assists in 30 games. The 26-year-old also recaptured his place in the England squad having been selected by Gareth Southgate for the 2022 FIFA World Cup as well as their Euro 2024 qualifiers in March and June. Maddison wants to leave Leicester but they are playing hard-ball in talks with interested parties Newcastle and Tottenham. Sources have confirmed to 90min that the Foxes are asking for Â£60m for Maddison and they are not actively pushing for an exit at this point, hoping that other clubs will enter the race. 90min reported in April that Liverpool were exploring a move for Maddison as part of their midfield overhaul. Arsenal and Manchester United had also looked into a deal earlier this year. feed But Newcastle and Tottenham's interest is firm and long-standing - the Magpies had multiple bids rejected by Leicester last summer, while Spurs have been linked with Maddison ever since he broke through at Coventry City in the mid-2010s. Tottenham opened direct talks with Leicester earlier this month and have signalled a willingness to make Maddison one of their highest earners. Spurs face the Foxes in a pre-season friendly in Thailand on July 23. Newcastle are yet to make a firm offer to Leicester but they remain in talks and are aware of the Â£60m price tag, though are reluctant to meet that figure and pay more than the Â£50m offered last summer."
Unhappy West Ham set to reject second Arsenal bid for Declan Rice,"Jun 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/unhappy-west-ham-to-reject-second-arsenal-bid-declan-rice,"West Ham United will reject Arsenal's second offer worth Â£90m for captain Declan Rice and are far from impressed with the lack of progress in negotiations, 90min understands. The Gunners had an opening Â£80m bid for Rice rejected by West Ham last week and now have returned to the negotiating table with an offer worth Â£90m. It's understood the offer is worth Â£75m guaranteed plus Â£15m in additional add-ons, but it remains some way short of the Â£100m valuation that West Ham have long placed on the 24-year-old. Sources have told 90min that West Ham are fuming with the latest offer put forward for Rice and have no intention of accepting, with a third bid already being prepared by Arsenal, whose approach so far is surprising given they had previously indicated to West Ham in talks that they would pay their asking price. Rice has emerged as Arsenal's number one target in the transfer window, though Mikel Arteta's side are also pushing ahead with their interest in Chelsea's Kai Havertz and Ajax's Jurrien Timber. Southampton's Romeo Lavia is another player being considered this summer as the club prepare to sanction an exit to Saudi Arabia for Thomas Partey. feed But Arsenal, who believe they are making progress in their bid to sign Rice, must do more to convince West Ham to part ways with their captain, who recently lifted the Europa Conference League trophy above his head to end the club's 43-year wait for major silverware. Personal terms are not expected to be a problem with Rice - he is likely to command wages well in excess of Â£200,000-a-week - but Arsenal must act quickly if they are to ensure that Manchester City don't look to tempt him with a move to the Etihad Stadium. The seven-time Premier League winners may need to replace their own captain, Ilkay Gundogan, as he continues to weigh up his future at the Etihad Stadium after completing a history-making treble during 2022/23. The German is out of contract this summer and has interest from Barcelona."
Tottenham confident of keeping Harry Kane long-term,"Jun 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-confident-keeping-harry-kane-long-term,"Tottenham Hotspur are convinced that they will start the 2023/24 season with Harry Kane still at the club, while they are also confident they can persuade the England captain to sign a new contract, sources have told 90min. Kane's current Spurs deal expires in 2024, and although the club have tried to tie him down to fresh terms over the last year, an agreement has not been reached. While Kane enjoyed a superb statistical 2022/23 campaign, becoming the all-time scorer for both Tottenham and England in the process, his team came eighth in the Premier League table - their lowest finish since 2008/09. Spurs' chaotic season saw them cycle through three managers, with Ryan Mason ending the campaign in charge after Antonio Conte and then Cristian Stellini were both sacked. Former Celtic boss Ange Postecoglou has now been named head coach on a four-year deal. feed 90min reported last month that, although Bayern Munich, Manchester United, PSG and Real Madrid are interested in Kane, the belief across Europe was that the striker would not leave this summer. Following Postecoglou's appointment at the start of June, Tottenham then informed Kane they had no plans to sell him this summer. Sources have now confirmed to 90min that Spurs remain confident of tying Kane down to a new contract. He is not agitating for a move away at this moment and he could wait to re-evaluate his situation closer to the expiry of his contract next year. Tottenham are continuing to scour the transfer market for reinforcements ahead of the new season. 90min understands that James Maddison remains a top target, though they could back away from David Raya due to Brentford's firm Â£40m asking price."
Daley Blind admits interest in returning to Man Utd,"Jun 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/daley-blind-admits-interest-in-returning-to-man-utd,"Former Manchester United defender Daley Blind has admitted he was tempted to offer himself back to the club during the January transfer window to reunite with Erik ten Hag. Blind spent four years with United after joining the club from Ajax off the back of an impressive 2014 World Cup campaign with Netherlands â he followed Louis van Gaal to Manchester. The Dutchman was of particular importance during the 2015/16 campaign, transitioning into the centre of defence and making more appearances (56) than any other player as United lifted the FA Cup. But he became less prominent under Jose Mourinho and was sold back to Ajax in 2018. Back in Amsterdam, Blind was an integral part of Ten Hagâs Ajax side that won a domestic league and cup double, as well as making waves in Europe by getting to within a single kick of the 2019 Champions League and claiming scalps of Real Madrid and Juventus along the way. Blind ended up leaving Ajax by mutual consent midway through the 2022/23 season. He was quickly snapped up by Bayern Munich on a short-term contract to plug a gap in the squad, but has revealed during an appearance on the UTD Podcast he was tempted to call Ten Hag. feed ""To be honest, he has the same agent as me, so the connection is not that far away,"" Blind explained. Although he thought about it, the 33-year-old didnât actually pick up the phone in the end. ""He did not really need me at that moment,"" the player said. ""He [had] already bought some players in. [Lisandro] Martinez as well, in the same position, and I am not blaming him for that. I am very thankful for the time [I had] with him. I learned a lot from him."" Blind is out of contract with Bayern at the end of the month and will become a free agent."
Gavi urges Barcelona to sign midfield target,"Jun 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/gavi-urges-barcelona-sign-midfield-target-martin-zubimendi,"Barcelona starlet Gavi has insisted that transfer target Martin Zubimendi would make an excellent summer signing. La Blaugrana are on the hunt for midfield reinforcements following the departure of club legend Sergio Busquets. Zubimendi, who played a starring role for Real Sociedad as they secured a top-four finish during the 2022/23 La Liga season, has been heavily linked with a move this summer, with Arsenal and Barcelona said to be interested. He has now received an endorsement from Spain teammate Gavi, who revealed in an interview with SPORT that he thinks Zubimendi would make an excellent replacement for Busquets. When asked if he's talked to Zubimendi about a transfer, Gavi replied: ""No, I respect him. I understand that he is at La Real. If he wants to play for another team or BarÃ§a, he will decide what he will do. ""Zubimendi is a top player. He would be a good replacement [for Busquets]. I love him. But I insist, we have to respect him and Real Sociedad. We'll see in the future."" feed Despite being heavily tipped to leave Real Sociedad, Zubimendi himself has stated that he is not looking to move on this summer. Addressing the intense transfer speculation recently, he said: ""Rumours, rumours. I told my agent that I didn't want to hear anything, especially in the winter. Leaving Real Sociedad during the season we are having would be illogical. Here, I am very happy. I look forward to a quiet summer."" Meanwhile, Barcelona are close to completing the signing of highly-rated Brazilian forward Vitor Roque for â¬40m."
Kyle Walker yet to make decision on Man City future,"Jun 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/kyle-walker-yet-to-make-decision-on-man-city-future,"Manchester City defender Kyle Walker is yet to make a firm decision on his future as Bayern Munich, Sheffield United and West Ham all show interest in the 33-year-old, 90min understands. Walker has just completed his sixth season at City following a 2017 transfer from Tottenham, capturing his fifth Premier League winnerâs medal, as well as a second FA Cup and a first Champions League title â the latter wrapped up an historic treble. He was ruled out through injury for a couple of months prior to the 2022 World Cup break, but was a key player throughout 2023 and even captained the team on a number of occasions. But Walker, having played all 180 minutes of the Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid, was only a late substitute in the final against Inter. 90min understands that surprise snub annoyed the player and is a significant factor in considering his future. feed Ideally, City want to keep him and are open to a possible contract extension beyond his current deal that expires at the end of next season. But the club will equally not stand in Walkerâs way should he want to leave and would be prepared to sell in that scenario. Talks with Bayern have already taken place. But Sheffield United, the club Walker joined at the age of seven and for whom he made seven senior appearances before being poached by Tottenham at 19, are also keen following their promotion back to the Premier League. West Ham are a third club keeping a close eye on the player with strong interest. As 90min recently revealed, Saudi Arabia could be also be a lucrative option."
Chelsea complete signing of Christopher Nkunku,"Jun 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-complete-signing-of-christopher-nkunku,"Chelsea have announced the long-awaited signing of Christopher Nkunku from RB Leipzig. The Blues first reached an agreement for the France international shortly after the closure of the summer 2022 transfer window. Nkunku finished the 2022/23 season at Leipzig, helping them to a top-four finish and glory in the DFB-Pokal, and he has now completed his move to west London on a six-year contract. In a statement, Nkunku said: ""I am incredibly happy to be joining Chelsea. A big effort was made to bring me to the club and I am looking forward to meeting my new coach and teammates and showing the Chelsea supporters what I can do on the pitch.Â  ""Having played in Ligue 1 and the Bundesliga, I now want to play in the Premier League, one of the strongest leagues in the world. I am very excited for this challenge and will be proud to wear the Chelsea shirt."" Nkunku becomes the first official signing of the Mauricio Pochettino era. The 25-year-old battled injuries during the 2022/23 season but still managed to make a huge impact in his final year at Leipzig, registering 23 goals and nine assists in 36 games across all competitions."
Tottenham consider David Raya alternatives as Brentford talks stall,"Jun 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-consider-david-raya-alternatives-brentford-talks-stall,"Tottenham Hotspur have informed David Raya that they could walk away from a deal to sign him this summer due to Brentford's asking price, sources have told 90min. The signing of a new goalkeeper was one of Spurs' priorities heading into the summer transfer window even before club captain Hugo Lloris expressed a desire to leave. They had identified Bees stopper Raya as one of their top targets and the Spain international is keen on a switch across London. But despite Raya's desire to join Spurs, the club are no closer to agreeing a fee with Brentford for his services. Thomas Frank reiterated during the final months of the 2022/23 season that Raya would be allowed to leave for a Â£40m fee, but Tottenham are unwilling to pay that sum and neither side has budged in recent negotiations. Raya has a year left to run on his contract and has already declared he will not be signing a new one, while Brentford recently completed the signing of his long-term successor - Netherlands international Mark Flekken. 90min understands that Spurs are keeping Raya informed of developments and that they are looking at other options. feed Empoli goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario has been linked with Tottenham, though 90min understands he is being lined up as a potential replacement for Andre Onana at Inter. Juventus, Roma and Fiorentina have also spoken to him recently, while Brighton and Manchester United watched him last season. Current Brighton goalkeeper Robert Sanchez, who lost his place to Jason Steele last season, is another player on their radar. The Seagulls are expected to sign another stopper in Bart Verbruggen in the coming weeks, too. Valencia's Giorgi Mamardashvili is a target for Spurs, but he would command a hefty fee just as is the case with Raya. Borussia Dortmund's Gregor Kobel is another name that Tottenham are looking at."
Man Utd actively searching for new goalkeeper as David de Gea contract talks continue,"Jun 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-new-goalkeeper-david-de-gea-contract-talks,"Manchester United are continuing talks with David de Gea over a new contract, though they are also keeping a watchful eye on the goalkeeper market, sources have told 90min. The Spaniard's deal expires at the end of the month, and the Red Devils revealed last week that they are still locked in negotiations with the 32-year-old when announcing their retained list. 90min reported earlier this month that De Gea had received a lucrative offer from the Saudi Pro League, but was expected to turn it down in favour of staying at Old Trafford. But less than a fortnight remains on De Gea's current deal and he is still yet to reach an agreement with Man Utd. In the meantime, 90min understands that Man Utd have been weighing up a move for a new goalkeeper in the transfer market. feed Man Utd's top targets are Porto's Diogo Costa and Brentford's David Raya. The latter is currently in talks with Tottenham, who are unwilling to meet the Bees' Â£40m asking price, but the Red Devils could stump up that sum and scupper Spurs' plans. Erik ten Hag also remains a huge fan of Andre Onana having worked with the Cameroonian at Ajax. 90min first reported in February that Inter may need to sell him in order to balance their books, while Chelsea have cooled their recent interest in the 27-year-old. Should De Gea sign a new contract, then it is less likely that Man Utd spend a huge amount on a new goalkeeper. Bayern Munich's Yann Sommer is a target for if the Spaniard does sign on."

Dortmund made a move for Alvarez last month, but talks stalled and interest emerged from Europa League winners West Ham United, who are long-term admirers. The Hammers held talks as they saw him as potential replacement for captain Declan Rice, who is set to leave this summer. However, Alvarez has made it clear to Ajax that he has his heart set on a move to the Ruhr Valley this summer where he is set to replace Jude Bellingham, who signed for Real Madrid earlier this month. Alvarez, who was the subject of bids from Chelsea and Newcastle last summer, has already agreed personal terms in principle with Dortmund, and they are now locked in talks with Ajax. Dortmund's latest bid is â¬35m plus bonuses - a club-record offer - but that is still short of Ajax's â¬45m asking price. feed While a deal is not yet agreed, sources close to Ajax do not anticipate Alvarez returning to the club and the player has already confirmed his desire to move. ""I spent four wonderful years here and this place still feels like home to me. I won a lot of trophies and developed. This is what could make it the right time to take the next step in my career. But everything has to be perfect. I have to improve, but so do Ajax,""Â Alvarez recently said. ""Of course it's nice when you are linked with a big club, but Ajax is also a big club. So I will always show respect to everyone in and around Amsterdam. I am very grateful to everyone here."""

Arsenal launch bid for Ajax defender Jurrien Timber,"Jun 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-launch-bid-ajax-defender-jurrien-timber,"Arsenal have made a bid to land Ajax defender Jurrien Timber, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Netherlands international has long been linked with a move to England and was a target for his former boss Erik Ten Hag at Manchester United, while Liverpool had also made enquiries in the last 12 months. However, Arsenal have stepped up their interest and made a move for the 21-year-old, lodging an opening offer. Talks are set to continue as their opening bid of â¬35m (Â£29m) is well short of Ajax's asking price, which 90min understands is â¬60m (Â£51m). Sources with knowledge of the situation have told 90min that Arsenal see Timber as a right-sided version of Oleksandr Zinchenko - someone who can play full-back but has the ability to carry the ball into midfield and operate in a pivot if required. Timber spent this season playing centrally for Ajax, but he has experience of playing all across the backline and in midfield for the Dutch giants. New Ajax boss Maurice Steijn hoped that that Timber - one of the squad's star players - would be staying put, but he looks set to lose him as well as with Mexican midfielder Edson Alvarez, who is set to join Borussia Dortmund. feed Timber had made it known earlier this year that he was looking to move this summer, although as recently as last week he insisted he and his agent were not talking with any other clubs. ""Will I stay with Ajax anyway? Iâm not sure, I can't say that,"" he said. ""I'm not in talks with Ajax now. My agent had a good talk a few times, but it's not like we're talking about anything right now."" It now remains to be seen how high Arsenal will bid, but sources close to both clubs believe a deal is 'highly likely' at this stage. The bid for Timber is the latest move by Arsenal, who are looking to make major plays early this transfer window. The Gunners are in talks with West Ham over England midfielder Declan Rice and Chelsea regarding Kai Havertz."

Folarin Balogun makes firm decision about Arsenal future,"Jun 19, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/folarin-balogun-makes-firm-decision-arsenal-future,"Arsenal striker Folarin Balogun refuses to be sent out on loan again during the 2023/24 season, forcing the Gunners to either hand him a first-team role or sell him on a permanent transfer. Balogun has made 10 senior appearances for Arsenal, but has spent the last 18 months elsewhere in search of more consistent opportunities. That included half a season at Middlesbrough in the second half of 2021/22 and then a breakout year with Reims in France. The talented forward scored 21 times in 37 Ligue 1 games across 2022/23 to help the club achieve their best finish for three years, while only Kylian Mbappe (29), Alexandre Lacazette (27) and Jonathan David (24) found the net more often.

There has been interest from other clubs given his form for Reims, but the Gunners are not rushing to cash in.

Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli and Martin Odegaard each scored 15 in all competitions, while Gabriel Jesus got 11 in an injury-disrupted season and Eddie Nketiah pitched in nine."

Neves has never hidden his desire to play in the Champions League and Barcelona have explored signing the midfielder.

Wolves have not yet given up hope of retaining Neves but Mendes has made it clear to Al-Hilal that a transfer to Saudi Arabia is the likeliest outcome, particularly given their concerns over meeting Financial Fair Play regulations have left them needing to raise money. Should Al-Hilal complete the deal, it would represent a drastic shift in approach from the Saudi Pro League. Up until this point, officials have focused largely on free agents or ageing players, but a big-money move for a 26-year-old will be sure to send shockwaves around Europe."

Lionel Messi insists he is 'happy' with Inter Miami decision,"Jun 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/lionel-messi-happy-with-inter-miami-decision,"Lionel Messi insists he is happy with his decision to snub a return to Barcelona this summer in order to take on a fresh challenge with struggling MLS club Inter Miami. Barcelona were determined to re-sign Messi ahead of next season, having seen him join Paris Saint-Germain two years ago after financial limitations meant they couldn't register his new contract. Messi was initially ready to go back to Camp Nou â even now, he is still keen for him and his family to live in the city when he retires from football â but was left unconvinced over whether the club would have the spending power to actually make it happen. Upon his move to Miami being announced, the 35-year-old said he wanted full control of the decision and not for it to be left in the hands of others, as had been the case in 2021. But even with Inter Miami sitting bottom of the Eastern Conference as Messi prepares to join when the mid-season MLS transfer window opens next month, he has no regrets about the choice. ""I'm well. Initially, we had a different idea [than joining Inter Miami],"" he told Publica in Argentina. ""We're happy with the decision taken. I'm ready and eager to face this new challenge, this change. It was an important step but at the same time, I was aware of what it meant, of what I was doing."" manual Messi had already revealed that conversations with Barcelona never progressed to the stage of formal talks about money, and that he would have taken the offer to move to Saudi Arabia had that the financial side of things been his chief source of motivation. Instead, lifestyle appears to have been among the factors in choosing Miami over elsewhere. Back in 2020, then San Jose Earthquakes head coach and former Argentina international Matias Almeyda told 90min why he thought MLS would be a good move for Messi in the future â and it had everything to do with being able to recapture a degree of normality in his family life. ""The U.S. is a big country,"" Almeyda toldÂ 90min at the time. ""It has 350m inhabitants, I think.Â The stars here can walk in peace in the street. Each person who wants a life can enjoy what he likes [and] will live a different life. ""For [Messi], for his children, for his wife, he will be able to walk, to ride a bicycle, he will be able to go to the supermarket. He won't be under that fame that turns you into a slave, you know? That's why I think [USA] could be a good place for him. In that way, you turn to be a normal human again. All the players that want to be normal pick this place."""
Bernardo Silva hoping for imminent decision on uncertain Man City future,"Jun 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bernardo-silva-hoping-for-imminent-decision-on-uncertain-man-city-future,"Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silva is hoping he will soon have an answer about where he will be playing his football next season, with the player still keen to leave the Etihad Stadium. Silva joined City from Monaco in a Â£43m deal in the summer of 2017 and has won 12 major trophies during his time in Manchester, including the Champions League earlier this month. He has made over 300 appearances for City and has usually been a regular starter throughout. But Silva first began to struggle off the pitch in 2020 during the UKâs first Covid-19 lockdown. And while he has been a consummate professional on the pitch, he has hoped to move on ever since. Just two days after the Champions League final, Silva again informed the club he wants to leave. feed âIâll be very honest, I donât know. Weâll see in the next few days. Even if I knew, it wouldnât be the space to talk about it [on international duty],â the 28-year-old told Eleven Sports when quizzed about his future ahead of Portugalâs Euro 2024 qualifying win over Bosnia & Herzegovina. Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain have been the clubs most regularly linked with Silva in recent months. 90min revealed at the start of May that City, who have been willing to sell players like Raheem Sterling, Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko in recent times, will not stand in the way of a summer transfer should a club be prepared to meet their valuation of Silva. However, that value is a potentially prohibitive Â£75m (â¬88m). PSG are firm admirers and would be ready to make a move, but the playerâs own preference is Barcelona. The issue for the Catalans is that any approach for Silva will hinge on first raising cash through player sales."
Kylian Mbappe offers cryptic response over PSG future,"Jun 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/kylian-mbappe-offers-cryptic-response-over-psg-future,"Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe has stressed his desire to remain with the club next season and even teased the idea of signing a contract extension to stick around even longer. Mbappe wrote a letter to confirm he would not trigger the one-year extension in his contract, which is due to expire in 2024, and attracted the frustration of his current employers when he tried to explain his decision. It's left PSG forced to consider selling Mbappe this summer before he can walk away for free at the end of the coming campaign, with Real Madrid desperate to finally lure the Frenchman over to the Santiago Bernabeu. Mbappe has previously insisted he is not looking to join Real Madrid this summer and recently reiterated his wish to remain with PSG for the 2023/24 campaign. While an extension currently seems unlikely, Mbappe insisted 'a lot can change' at the club in the coming 12 months, teasing the idea of fresh terms. manual ""I have already said before that Iâd stay [at PSG]. I have only decided to play at PSG next season,"" he told Telefoot.  ""Many things can happen in a year, especially at a club like PSG."" Despite Mbappe's determination, PSG could choose to cash in on the 24-year-old this summer. 90min understands club officials are adamant Mbappe will not be allowed to leave for free and so a summer sale may be their preferred option, although valuing the France forward may not be easy. PSG, understandably, have placed an enormous asking price on Mbappe's head but, given he is approaching the final year of his contract, suitors are reluctant to break the bank just 12 months before he could join for free."
Barcelona close to agreeing Vitor Roque transfer ahead of Premier League clubs,"Jun 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-close-vitor-roque-transfer-premier-league-clubs,"Barcelona are close to agreeing a â¬40m transfer for 18-year-old Brazil forward Vitor Roque, although 90min understands there remains an outstanding issue with the exact structure of the proposed deal with Athletico Paranaense. Only turning 18 earlier this year, Roque has been playing first-team football in his homeland since 2021 and joined Athletico from first senior club Cruzeiro last year. Roque already has ten goals in 25 appearances across all competitions for his current team so far in 2023 and his form, also rewarded with a first senior international appearance for Brazil in March, has unsurprisingly brought significant attention from Europe. From the Premier League, Arsenal are firm admirers of the player and have held talks. Manchester United and Newcastle have additionally shown interest, but Roqueâs own preference has also been Barcelona. Chelsea were another to contact his representatives. feed 90min revealed back in February that Barcelona were leading the race for the talent. Personal terms between the Catalans and Roque have already been in place for several months. But Athletico have been waiting for Barcelona to strike a deal with them regarding the transfer fee that would take the player to Spain. The agreed price will be around the â¬40m mark, but the two clubs are yet to agree the breakdown of the payments. Barcelona, who continue to navigate troubling financial times, are seeking to spread out instalments as much as possible. There is, however, still an expectation that a deal will be struck."
Chelsea exploring options over Moises Caicedo & Andre Onana price concerns,"Jun 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-exploring-options-moises-caicedo-andre-onana-price-concerns,"Chelsea are exploring alternative targets to both Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo and Inter goalkeeper Andre Onana amid concerns over the price of the two players, 90min understands. The Blues are braced for another expensive transfer window but cannot afford to be as free-spending as they were during the first year of the Todd Boehly-Clearlake Capital ownership, which saw close to Â£600m shelled out on new players. Villarreal striker Nicolas Jackson is close to a Â£30m move to Stamford Bridge after being identified as a cheaper alternative to Napoli's Victor Osimhen, who is valued at over Â£100m. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea are now looking for cheaper alternatives to both Caicedo and Onana after growing concerned about the costs of striking both deals. Brighton are looking for close to Â£100m to sell Caicedo - a fee Chelsea are reluctant to meet - and so the likes of Southampton's Romeo Lavia and Inter's Nicolo Barella have been mentioned as possible targets. Chelsea are still keen on Caicedo, however, and will continue attempting to negotiate a lower fee. feed Similarly, Inter are standing firm on their asking price for Andre Onana, whose future has been linked to that of Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku as he eyes a permanent return to the Serie A side. With a deal proving complicated thus far, Chelsea are analysing their options in goal and have not yet ruled out beginning the season with Kepa Arrizabalaga as their starter. Among the options being considered are Valencia's Giorgi Mamardashvili and Brentford's David Raya, while AC Milan's Mike Maignan is an expensive target who could be outside of Chelsea's price range. While Chelsea are understood to be prepared to invest heavily in their squad this summer, there is an acceptance that player sales will play a significant part in defining their budget going forwards. Mateo Kovacic is on the cusp of joining Manchester City, while Kai Havertz and Mason Mount are wanted by Arsenal and Manchester United respectively. Edouard Mendy, Kalidou Koulibaly, Hakim Ziyech and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang are all targets for Saudi Arabia. Chelsea are also looking to sell Romelu Lukaku, while Trevoh Chalobah, Cesar Azpilicueta, Conor Gallagher, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Christian Pulisic face uncertain futures."
UEFA president sends warning to Saudi Arabia over transfer spree,"Jun 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/uefa-president-sends-warning-saudi-arabia-transfer-spree,"UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin has warned Saudi Arabia that spending huge sums on big-name players is not the way to build success. Cristiano Ronaldo's switch to Al-Nassr in January has opened the door to a number of other players. Former Real Madrid teammate Karim Benzema has already made the move and plenty of high-profile names are expected to follow in the coming months as Saudi officials prepare to inject huge sums of money into their clubs. Asked whether he was concerned about losing so many stars to Saudi Arabia, Ceferin told NOS: ""No, no, no."" He then went on to argue that Saudi Arabia's approach to business this summer could actually harm its own footballing future and urged officials to look back at the Chinese Super League, whose lucrative attempt to become a global powerhouse during the 2010s ultimately ended in failure. The Chinese Super League saw a huge influx of money between 2012 and 2017, with players like Oscar and Carlos Tevez leaving Europe to sign some of the most lucrative contracts in history. But concerns over the long-term viability of the league led to changes in 2018, which limited spending and forced clubs to focus on producing homegrown talents. manual ""I think that it's mainly a mistake for Saudi Arabian football,"" Ceferin explained. ""Why is that a problem for them? Because they should invest in academies, they should bring coaches, and they should develop their own players. ""The system of buying the players that almost ended their career is not the system that develops football. It was a similar mistake in China when they all brought players who are at the end of their career. ""Tell me one player who is top, top age and who starts his career and went to play in Saudi Arabia?"""
David Raya admits concerns over Brentford price tag as Tottenham talks continue,"Jun 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/david-raya-admits-concerns-brentford-price-tag-tottenham-talks-continue,"Brentford goalkeeper David Raya has admitted he fears the Bees' Â£40m price tag could block a summer transfer. Raya is entering the final year of his contract and Brentford have openly admitted that he is free to leave this summer if a club meets their valuation. Dutch international Mark Flekken has already been signed as a replacement. Chelsea and Manchester United are both known admirers of Raya but 90min understands that Tottenham are working towards an agreement over personal terms with the 27-year-old, although Brentford's lofty asking price is proving problematic. Speaking to The Times, Raya confirmed he is keen to leave Brentford this summer but voiced concerns over the price put on his head. ""I will always feel close to this team,"" Raya stressed. ""Being part of the promotion to the Premier League is something I will never forget. ""I know there are rumours about me leaving. There are some options for me to go but obviously Brentford are asking for a lot of money. That could make clubs not want to buy me, it could make them look somewhere else. feed ""But if thatâs the value they give me, then itâs up to them. I have a year left on my contract and until then Iâm a Brentford player, thereâs nothing I can do. ""I have ambitions to make the next step in my career. I want to try to win titles and to compete in Europe in the next couple of years. Iâm 27 now and I feel like Iâm at the point in my career when I want to make that step up. There are options out there but itâs not just my ambitions, the club also needs to let me go.â If he does not succeed in leaving Brentford this summer, Raya vowed to remain committed to the Bees until the end of next season. ""Iâm a professional,"" he said. ""If I end up staying at Brentford I will always give my all, thatâs my job. If I have to stay, Iâll try to have an even better season than last season."""
Martin Odegaard makes admission on Arsenal contract talks,"Jun 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/martin-odegaard-admission-arsenal-contract-talks,"Martin Odegaard says he is happy at Arsenal and hopes to remain at the club for years to come in response to rumoured transfer interest from Paris Saint-Germain. Odegaard enjoyed a stunning campaign by leading Arsenal to second place in the Premier League and secure a return to the Champions League. The Norwegian scored 15 league goals alongside seven assists and 90min revealed in May that Arsenal were planning to sit down with Odegaard to thrash out new terms.  The 24-year-old's contract current contract expires in 2025 and he admitted he is not personally involved in fresh talks right now. He told TV2: ""I have a few years left on the contract, I'm fine and I hope to be at the club for a long time to come. ""I have not spoken to them, that is not my task. To be honest, I don't know how the situation is right now. Well, it's not me who controls it. Now I'm focusing on the national team, so I may take it after the summer if they want to do something."" feed Arsenal have locked down a number of their top talents to new deals in recent months, with Bukayo Saka, Aaron Ramsdale and William Saliba all signing new contracts of late. The north London side are still looking to make their first big splash in the summer transfer window and have moved for West Ham midfielder Declan Rice, though the Europa Conference League winners rejected a first offer which was worth Â£80m with Â£10m in add-ons. Kai Havertz is another target for Mikel Arteta, though his side will face competition from Bayern Munich for the Germany international. "
Chelsea closing in on Nicolas Jackson agreement with Villarreal,"Jun 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-close-nicolas-jackson-transfer-agreement-villarreal,"Chelsea are closing in on an agreement to sign Villarreal striker Nicolas Jackson, 90min can confirm. Personal terms have been agreed with the 21-year-old Senegal international, who ended last season with nine goals in his final eight La Liga games, and talks are on with Villarreal over a transfer fee. Jackson's contract contains a release clause which sits at around Â£30m but sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea are likely to strike a deal which would see them pay in instalments, rather than one up-front sum. Villarreal are prepared to accept such a structure. Should all go according to plan, Jackson will become the first signing of the Mauricio Pochettino era at Stamford Bridge. The towering forward was not Chelsea's primary striker option, with the Blues exploring high-profile deals for the likes of Victor Osimhen and Harry Kane previously. But the club's new recruitment team have identified Jackson as a worthwhile target and talks have progressed rapidly. feed 90min understands that interest in Osimhen remains, but Chelsea are aware that Napoli's huge asking price - well over Â£100m - could prevent a deal being struck. Jackson will join a young group of forwards all looking to impress Pochettino in pre-season. Academy graduate Armando Broja is back after a nasty knee injury ended his campaign six months early, while January signing David Datro Fofana is also seeking further involvement in the senior setup. It remains to be seen whether Kai Havertz will remain with the group as Arsenal and Bayern Munich are both keen to strike a deal. While Chelsea would prefer to keep the German around, their need to raise funds could see them cash in for the right price - thought to be over Â£60m. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is in talks over a move to Saudi Arabia and Romelu Lukaku also has interest from the Middle East, but the latter is thought to favour a return to Inter."
Federico Valverde offers firm response to Chelsea & Liverpool interest,"Jun 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/federico-valverde-offers-firm-response-chelsea-liverpool-interest,"Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde has firmly ruled out leaving the Santiago Bernabeu this summer, despite interest from Chelsea, Liverpool and a handful of other clubs. Los Blancos have bolstered their midfield already this window with the blockbuster addition of Jude Bellingham from Borussia Dortmund, giving Carlo Ancelotti's side an excess of elite midfield options going forward. Bellingham joins a group which already includes Valverde, Eduardo Camavinga, Aurelien Tchouameni, Luka Modric and Toni Kroos, while Dani Ceballos is expected to sign a contract extension as well. With the battle for midfield minutes at Real intensifying, 90min understands that Chelsea and Liverpool were among the sides to reach out to the Spanish outfit to enquire about Valverde's availability. But both were quickly knocked back. Real Madrid have no desire to part ways with the 24-year-old and Valverde has confirmed he is not looking to leave either. feed ""No, no - Iâm at Madrid, trying to enjoy every moment and leave my mark on the best club in the world,"" Valverde told ESPN Argentina in response to a question about joining Chelsea or Liverpool. ""I want to keep winning titles for Real Madrid fans."" Valverde has been a key player for Real in recent years and already boasts over 200 appearances for Los Blancos, lifting no fewer than nine trophies during his five seasons with the senior side. It is expected that Valverde, who has also been used on the right wing by Ancelotti, will remain a key part of Real's midfield alongside Bellingham, but the boss undoubtedly has a tough task at hand to keep all his key stars happy. 37-year-old Modric and 33-year-old Kroos are approaching the ends of their respective careers, however, and Valverde is seen as a key part of both the present and future in Madrid."

The Sweden international joined Spurs on loan in January 2022 on a deal which included an option to make the deal permanent for a fee of around Â£30m, but Spurs declined to trigger that clause and instead pursued a discount. As 90min reported on Friday, the two clubs settled on a fee of closer to Â£25m and Kulusevski has now completed his return to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Kulusevski has inked a five-year contract and becomes the first signing of the Ange Postecoglou era. feed Kulusevski endured a mixed 18 months on loan in London. He racked up seven goals and 16 assists in 57 appearances in all competitions, often looking like one of Spurs' top talents when he was in form.

Every player released by Premier League clubs this summer,"Jun 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/every-player-released-by-premier-league-clubs-this-summer,"To paraphrase the scout that recruited Billy Beane, the protagonist of Moneyball, everyone will one day be told that they can no longer play the beautiful game. For some, it's at 18, for others, it may be 40. But we are all told. Every summer, the Premier League brutally reveals exactly which players have been told their time has come, with a list of all the individuals released by each top-flight team. For some, it is a question of seeing out their contract in search of a free transfer and lucrative signing-on fee elsewhere. Yet, for many others, it is the end of the road in the Premier League. Here is the full list of released players at the end of the 2022/23 Premier League season. Player Level Zach Awe Under-21 Joel Ideho Under-23 George Lewis Under-23 Ainsley Maitland-Niles Senior Matt Smith Under-23 Tom Smith Under-21 Ainsley Maitland-Niles joined Arsenal as a six-year-old but spent the final 18 months of his two decades at the club on loan.

However, injuries hampered the 32-year-old throughout the 2022/23 campaign, prompting his departure alongside regular substitute Saman Ghoddos.

Wilfried Zaha's deal expires this summer but the club have officially offered their star winger a contract. Whether the 30-year-old will finally be tempted away from Selhurst Park - with the untold riches of the Saudi Pro League looming - remains to be seen. Nathan Ferguson is also weighing up a new deal. Player Level Einar Iversen Under-21 Yerry Mina Senior Andros Townsend Senior Yerry Mina left Goodison Park on considerably better terms with the fanbase than the nadir of January. After a defeat to lowly Southampton, the towering centre-back was surrounded by furious Everton fans demanding an improvement. Mina started the final four games of the season which earned the seven points that ultimately kept Everton in the Premier League. Andros Townsend will join Mina in an exit but made his last appearance for the club in March 2022 before suffering a debilitating ACL injury.

The Foxes can scarcely afford to be as passive in the current window after confirming the release of seven senior players. Youri Tielemans has already secured a move to Europe-bound Aston Villa and Leicester will also miss out on a transfer fee for Caglar Soyuncu.

Bayern Munich president slams Barcelona over Joshua Kimmich pursuit,"Jun 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-president-slams-barcelona-joshua-kimmich-pursuit,"Bayern Munich president Herbert Hainer has criticised Barcelona head coach Xavi for his admission of his desire to sign midfielder Joshua Kimmich. While Bayern have always been determined to keep hold of Kimmich, 90min understands that the German's representatives have spoken with clubs across Europe, including Barcelona, to gauge the interest in the midfielder. Xavi was asked about his side's interest in Kimmich last month and did not shy away from discussing his desire to work with the 28-year-old, telling Mundo Deportivo: ""He is a super top player, who understands the game in a fantastic way. If there is an open door, there will be a negotiation with Bayern."" His comments appear to have frustrated Hainer, who questioned Xavi's conduct in a recent interview with Sky Sports Germany.

Joshua Kimmich is an absolute cornerstone for us."" feed Confirming his desire to keep Kimmich, Haimer added: ""Joshua is a leader, has won many titles with us and will also continue to win titles with us in the future.

Man Utd are looking to bring in two strikers this summer - one ready-made forward with experience and one younger option, with 20-year-old Hojlund falling into the latter category. Eriksen, who joined Man Utd from Brentford on a free transfer last summer, was asked about Hojlund's potential move to Old Trafford prior to Denmark's 1-0 win against Northern Ireland on Friday night. ""I can see him [Hojlund] at Manchester United, but I haven't recommended him to Erik ten Hag,â Eriksen said to Ekstra Bladet. ""He is a fantastic guy and a good player and has really developed brilliantly at Atalanta. What the club ends up doing, I will not be able to answer."" feed Eriksen added: ""It's a club where there's a huge amount of attention because everyone has an attitude towards Manchester United. I had tried a lot when I came to the club. So I knew a little bit about what size the club was. ""For younger players who come to the club, it can be really difficult, because the club is the size it is now."" Hojlund enjoyed a superb debut season with Atalanta having only joined from Austrian side Sturm Graz last summer, registering 10 goals and four assists across 33 games."

Chelsea hoping to beat Premier League clubs to signing of Nicolas Jackson,"Jun 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-premier-league-clubs-signing-nicolas-jackson,"Chelsea are looking to beat several Premier League sides to the signing of Villarreal forward Nicolas Jackson, sources have told 90min. The Senegal international was one of La Liga's breakout stars of the 2022/23 season, scoring 12 goals in 26 games for the Yellow Submarine. He came close to leaving Villarreal midway through the season, with 90min reporting in January that Bournemouth backed away from a deal due to concerns over injuries which arose in his medical. The Cherries have been exploring a fresh deal to sign Jackson this summer after securing Premier League safety, but they face strong competition for his signature.

The Sweden international has spent the last season-and-a-half on loan at Spurs and is set to continue his stay in north London. Kulusevski joined Tottenham back in January 2022, with his loan contract containing an obligatory purchase clause if Spurs qualified for the 2023/24 UEFA Champions League. But seeing as Tottenham finished eighth in the Premier League, this became an optional clause instead and the club have been working with Juventus to bring the fee down from â¬35m - 90min understands they have settled on a â¬30m deal. As negotiations over his future were ongoing, Kulusevski was not mentioned when Spurs announced their retained list, whereas fellow loanees Clement Lenglet and Arnaut Danjuma were. feed 90min reported earlier this week that Kulusevski - who was keen to join Spurs permanently - may have work to do in order to impress new head coach Ange Postecoglou, but sources close to his camp are confident that he will impress the Australian over the summer and throughout the season. Kulusevski was an instant success upon his arrival at Tottenham, linking up superbly with Harry Kane and Son Heung-min towards the end of the 2021/22 season and helping them to a fourth-place finish in the Premier League. However, due to injuries and general instability across the club, Kulusevski's 2022/23 campaign was not as prolific, ending the season with only two goals and eight assists across 37 games in all competitions."
Bayern Munich step up interest in Arsenal target Kai Havertz,"Jun 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-step-up-interest-arsenal-target-kai-havertz,"Bayern Munich are ready to rival Arsenal for the signing of Chelsea forward Kai Havertz, 90min understands. The Germany international has been heavily linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge this summer. 90min reported earlier this week that Arsenal were in talks with the Blues over a shock move across London, while Real Madrid had previously explored replacing Karim Benzema with Havertz but did not want to meet his lofty price tag. Bayern are also on the hunt for a new centre forward this transfer window, with 90min reporting back in March that they were considering a move for Havertz. Sources have confirmed that the Bavarians are stepping up their interest in the 24-year-old and are in talks over a deal. Arsenal are not out of the picture just yet despite Bayern's re-emergence in the race, with Havertz believed to be open to either a move to the Emirates Stadium or the Allianz Arena. feed Speaking earlier in 2023, Havertz admitted that it would be hard to turn down Bayern if they came calling, while he would also like to work with Thomas Tuchel again following their time together at Chelsea. ""Bayern is a huge club and for me, especially as a German, it's difficult to say no - but my goal has always been to play abroad and see a new country,"" he said. When asked whether he'd want to link up with Tuchel again, Havertz replied: ""Definitely! You never know what will happen in football. Everything can happen very quickly. Never say never."" Havertz has struggled to consistently make an impact at Chelsea following his 2020 move from Bayer Leverkusen, though did score the winning goal in the 2021 UEFA Champions League final against Manchester City.

He is not short of suitors - 90min first reported back in April that boyhood club Sheffield United were interested in a reunion with Walker, while West Ham United and clubs in Saudi Arabia have also emerged as potential destinations since. And 90min understands that Bayern are now in talks with Walker, with both parties sharing a mutual interest in finalising a deal. Bayern are set to part ways with right-back Benjamin Pavard this summer and so are on the lookout for a replacement to come in and compete with Noussair Mazraoui for the starting spot. feed Interestingly, Man City and Bayern have remained in close contact regarding the futures of Joao Cancelo and Joshua Kimmich. 90min understands the German champions want to keep Cancelo following his six-month loan spell in Bavaria, but for a fee lower than his â¬70m purchase clause. Man City are among several top European sides interested in Kimmich, who is considering his future at Bayern. Reports in Germany have claimed that head coach Thomas Tuchel has regularly been at the club's offices since the Bundesliga season ended and has not yet been on holiday as he is working on plans for the 2023/24 campaign. Bayern wrestled the Bundesliga title away from rivals Borussia Dortmund on the final day of the 2022/23 season in dramatic fashion, with BVB losing at home to Mainz and Die Roten beating Koln late on to jump back into top spot. Despite Tuchel's European pedigree, Bayern were emphatically dumped out of the UEFA Champions League at the quarter-final stage by eventual winners Man City."

Chelsea confirm departure of Tiemoue Bakayoko,"Jun 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-confirm-departure-tiemoue-bakayoko,"Tiemoue Bakayoko has officially left Chelsea 12 months before his contract was due to expire. A Â£40m signing from Monaco in 2017, Bakayoko was the second-biggest purchase in club history at the time but he would spend just one campaign with the first team before spending the next five years out on loan. Bakayoko made 43 appearances for Chelsea in the 2017/18 campaign and never ended up playing for the Blues again, with his final competitive outing coming in a 3-0 loss to Newcastle on the final day of the campaign. A loan to AC Milan was arranged for the 2018/19 campaign, with the Rossoneri including an option to buy, but a mixed run of form saw them reject the offer and Bakayoko would eventually return to Monaco for the 2019/20 season. Monaco also declined to trigger their purchase option for Bakayoko, who was back in Italy the following campaign for a reunion with former Milan boss Gennaro Gattuso. feed He returned to Chelsea in the summer of 2021 and agreed a two-year loan with Milan which included an obligation to buy if Bakayoko made 15 Serie A appearances in either campaign, but he was restricted to just 14 outings in 2021/22 before being handed just 39 minutes across three appearances this past season. Despite his Chelsea contract running until 2024, the Blues have now bid farewell to Bakayoko 12 months earlier than expected. ""We thank Tiemoue for his contribution during his season at Stamford Bridge,"" a club statement read. The summer transfer window in which Bakayoko arrived at Chelsea has gone down in infamy for its poor return. Aside from the success story of Antonio Rudiger and the reliable service of backup goalkeeper Willy Caballero, the Blues spent a total of Â£146m to land Bakayoko, Davide Zappacosta, Alvaro Morata and Danny Drinkwater.

Man Utd exclude David de Gea from end of season retained list,"Jun 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-exclude-david-de-gea-end-of-season-retained-list,"Manchester United have confirmed that contract negotiations are ongoing with David de Gea after announcing the release of seven players. The 32-year-old has completed his 12th season at Old Trafford, which saw him scoop the Premier League's Golden Glove award for the most clean sheets. But the Spaniard's displays haven't all been singing and dancing, with concerns raised over De Gea's ability to distribute the ball the way Erik ten Hag would like. He has also made various blunders when attempting to stop shots despite pulling off a glut of sensational saves. 90min has reported at length that despite those concerns, United and Ten Hag are keen to tie down De Gea to a new contract at Old Trafford. But there will need to be a significant reduction in his Â£350,000-a-week wages and that's something the former Atletico Madrid stopper has agreed in principle. Nevertheless, United have been unable to confirm De Gea's retention when confirming which players will be staying at Old Trafford and which will be leaving, and instead revealed that talks are ongoing over a new deal. Phil Jones, Axel Tuanzebe, Ethan Galbraith, Di'Shon Bernard, Eric Hanbury, Charlie Wellens and Manni Norkett are the seven players departing, but contract extensions have been triggered for goalkeeping duo Tom Heaton and Nathan Bishop. feed United's desire for De Gea to stay has not affected their plans to bring a new goalkeeper to the club. Porto's Diogo Costa and Brentford's David Raya are two players they are keeping a close eye on, while sources have confirmed to 90min that the club are monitoring the situation of Inter's Andre Onana - he has been a long-term target for Chelsea and could cost around Â£40m. Ten Hag's other priority is to sign a new striker capable of becoming the club's regular number nine. Anthony Martial has proven to be unreliable injury wise and Wout Weghorst's loan spell at the club was only ever seen as a short-term measure.  Harry Kane, Victor Osimhen and Dusan Vlahovic are three of the more high-profile players on United's shortlist, with interest in lesser-known stars Benjamin Sesko and Rasmus Hojlund also ongoing."

Speaking to De Telegraaf about his frustrating first season at Bayern Munich, Gravenberch revealed that he would want to leave the club this summer if he isn't guaranteed more game time.

In 27 Premier League appearances during the 2022/23 season, the Brazilian managed just one goal for the club, though he did add a further two in their UEFA Champions League campaign. Despite his lack of form shown throughout last season, Richarlison has been linked with a move to Real Madrid, in part due to his relationship with manager Carlo Ancelotti - the two worked together at Everton.

The Seagulls believe they have a strong chance of finalising a deal, while they would be open to selling Caicedo to Chelsea with Gallagher used as a makeweight. feed Gallagher is naturally a central midfielder but was utilised as a number ten and a withdrawn centre forward by Chelsea caretaker manager Frank Lampard towards the end of the season. Brighton are not the only other Premier League side interested in Gallagher. He is on Newcastle United and West Ham United's respective midfielder shortlists, while Tottenham have been keen in the past but are believed to be prioritising a move for Leicester City's James Maddison.

Walker had been expected by many to start the final but instead came on in the latter stages as Pep Guardiola opted to pick a back four consisting of Manuel Akanji, John Stones, Ruben Dias and Nathan Ake. Mahrez was an unused substitute. Both players have 12 months remaining on their current deals at the Etihad Stadium, but extensions are not currently under discussion. 33-year-old Walker remains an important part of Pep Guardiola's plans despite not starting the final, though it's believed that he's considering his options. 90min understands that boyhood club Sheffield United are prepared to offer him a three-year contract in order to return to the Steel City, while Aston Villa and West Ham are also keeping tabs on his situation. feed But an offer could also be forthcoming from Saudi Arabia, sources have confirmed to 90min, which would see Walker pick up a bumper pay packet to wind down his career. City team-mate Mahrez is also wanted in the Middle East amid interest from both Al Ittihad and Al Ahli. Both clubs are owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) - Newcastle's main financial backers - and the former have already signed Karim Benzema this summer and are closing on N'Golo Kante. 90min understands that Mahrez is ready to push for a move this summer after failing to start the FA Cup final in addition to sitting on the bench in Istanbul, and the club will not stand in his way if he asks to leave.

But sources have confirmed that the first bid put forward was worth just Â£80m with Â£10m in add-ons, which has swiftly been rejected by West Ham. Indeed, the Hammers are mystified and surprised by the value of Arsenal's bid given they've made their stance on Rice's price abundantly clear. feed Rice's contract at West Ham runs until the summer of 2025, with a sale this summer likely to help the club extract full value. He has previously stated his ambition to play in the Champions League and win trophies, though he has now achieved the latter after becoming just the third captain in the club's history - following in the footsteps of Bobby Moore and Billy Bonds - to hoist silverware above his head. Talks will continue been West Ham and Arsenal in the coming days but Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United are all waiting in the wings to make an offer for Rice.

PSG engage in war of words with Kylian Mbappe over contract talks statement,"Jun 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-war-of-words-kylian-mbappe-contract-talks-statement,"Paris Saint-Germain have entered into a war of words with star forward Kylian Mbappe after labelling the Frenchman's recent contract statement 'emphatically untrue'. A letter revealing Mbappe's decision not to trigger his one-year contract extension, which would carry his deal over into 2024, sparked widespread confusion and shock among PSG officials. In response to the reaction, Mbappe issued a statement claiming that he has never entertained conversations over a contract extension with PSG, who have known for nearly 12 months that he did not plan to trigger the extension. PSG have now fired back at Mbappe, accusing the 24-year-old of 'emphatic' lies. ""It is emphatically untrue to say Mbappeâs team have not been involved in renewal discussions,"" a club spokesperson told the New York Times. manual With Mbappe's contract now set to expire in 12 months, PSG face the prospect of being forced to sell the forward this summer before he can walk away for free at the end of the coming campaign - an eventuality sources believe is not even being considered at this point. However, Mbappe himself has vowed to remain with PSG for the coming campaign, denying allegations he is looking to engineer a move to Real Madrid this summer. Real Madrid are looking for a new striker this summer following the departure of Karim Benzema and had been prepared to push for Tottenham's Harry Kane, with Mbappe seen as a target for a free transfer in 2024. Their stance may well have changed following this public bust-up between Mbappe and PSG, who could be forced to consider offers for the superstar in the coming weeks. The saga is the latest twist in what is shaping to be a defining summer for PSG. Lionel Messi's departure to Inter Miami has already been confirmed, while Neymar's representatives have explored the possibility of the Brazilian moving to Saudi Arabia. Christophe Galtier has also been dismissed as manager despite delivering the club's ninth Ligue 1 title in the past 11 years - a consequence of failing to deliver in the Champions League among other things."
Jorge Mendes discusses Ansu Fati's Barcelona future & Ruben Neves swap links,"Jun 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jorge-mendes-ansu-fati-barcelona-future-ruben-neves-swap,"Agent Jorge Mendes has revealed that Ansu Fati wants to stay at Barcelona, while he provided a cryptic update on the future of Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves. Fati has proven to be one of BarÃ§a's most successful graduates from their La Masia academy system in recent years. He has already scored 29 goals in 109 games for the club and doesn't even turn 21 until October. However, reports in recent months have claimed that La Blaugrana could sell Fati in order to raise funds for incoming transfers. 90min reported in May that Barcelona told the winger he could leave the club, with Mendes attempting to broker a swap deal that would send Neves to Camp Nou and Fati to Molineux. But Fati has so far resisted attempts to leave Barcelona, with Mendes confirming this in a recent interview. ""Ansu wants to stay, he wants to stay,"" Mendes insisted to Jijantes. When pushed for an answer on whether that means Fati will stay, Mendes replied: ""He has scored three goals in his last two games, what more do you want?

West Ham realise they may have to sanction an initial loan for Scamacca but they hope to include a sizeable option to purchase the player in any deal. Roma have moved for Scamacca having finalised their opening deals of the summer in the shape of Houssem Aouar on a free from Lyon and Eintracht Frankfurt defender Evan Ndicka.

Kylian Mbappe and Real Madrid: Timeline of transfer saga,"Jun 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/kylian-mbappe-and-real-madrid-timeline-of-transfer-saga,"Strap in, folks! Another relentless barrage of updates regarding Kylian Mbappe's future await this summer. The latest from France suggests a move away from Paris Saint-Germain is inevitable, but this isn't the first time we've seen such a situation develop in the French capital regarding their coveted superstar. Real Madrid, long-time admirers of the Frenchman, are bound to emerge as a potential destination for Mbappe if he was to leave the Parc des Prices, and here's a reminder of the Spanish club's history with the French forward.  Mbappe burst onto the scene for an excellent Monaco side that contained the likes of Bernardo Silva, Thomas Lemar, Fabinho, Joao Moutinho, and Radamel Falcao during the 2016/17 season. The young Frenchman, then just 17, scored 15 Ligue 1 goals and six in the Champions League as Monaco lifted the league title and reached the semi-finals of Europe's premier club competition.  Mbappe's staggering form piqued the interest of Real Madrid, with reports emerging that the Spaniards had agreed a deal with Monaco for the forward worth upwards of â¬160m.  The French club, however, denied striking a deal with Real. While Real's interest in Mbappe was certainly concrete, PSG saw an opportunity to snatch the Parisian-born youngster away from their grasp. Just three weeks after signing Neymar in a record-breaking deal, PSG made their move for Mbappe and offered Monaco â¬180m for the Frenchman's services. The French club were also willing to double Real's reported salary offer of â¬7m. PSG wrapped up the deal from under Real Madrid's nose at the end of the 2017 summer transfer window, with Mbappe joining on an initial loan. A buy-option, however, would keep him in his hometown until 2022. ð£ ""Cuando me dicen que FICHE a MBAPPÃ yo CONTESTO: ""TRANQUILO..."" ð£ð³ Â¡OJO a FLORENTINO PÃREZ en EXCLUSIVA con @jpedrerol! #ChiringuitoFlorentino pic.twitter.com/0LzM7FdEi9 To the surprise of very few, Mbappe blossomed into a superstar at PSG and would eventually break Edinson Cavani's all-time scoring record.  For several years, there was a level of serenity regarding Mbappe's situation in Paris, but this started to change in 2021 and Real, still bitter from the events in 2017, smelt blood. They started to pursue Mbappe with a renewed sense of purpose, and club president Florentino Perez even assured Real Madrid supporters the Frenchman would join Los Blancos that summer. ""I go with the mask and they tell me 'Sign MbappÃ©!' Madrid needs a change from time to time. I do everything possible so that Madrid does not lose its rightful place. Tranquilo!,"" Perez said, with 'tranquilo' translating to 'don't worry' or 'calm'.  He was a man with a plan. Reports had surfaced towards the end of the 2020/21 season that Mbappe was set to force his way out of PSG, and Real's renewed interest sparked danger for PSG with the player's contract expiring the following summer.  However, PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi refused to back down and at the start of the 2021 summer transfer window, he asserted that Mbappe wasn't going anywhere. ""I will be clear,"" Al-Khelaifi then told L'Equipe. ""Mbappe is going to stay in Paris. We will never sell him and he will never leave on a free [transfer]."" A summer saga developed and Real opted to make their move until the very last moment. PSG were pulling out all the stops to convince Mbappe to stay in Paris, with French President Emmanuel Macron even chiming in with his two cents.  However, an offer eventually arrived from the Spanish club in the final week of the transfer window reportedly worth â¬160m. And while PSG were unsuccessful in their attempts to bring Mbappe to the negotiating table themselves, they rebuffed Real's offer before ignoring the reported two follow-up offers made by Los Blancos as deadline day neared.  At the end of the 2021 summer window, Mbappe remained a PSG player but he was into the final year of his deal. Something had to give. Kylian MbappÃ© extends his contract until 2025  ð´ðµ #KylianCestParis https://t.co/x65CgD5hpO Mbappe's situation in Paris was a precarious one throughout 2021/22, with PSG seemingly playing with fire. There was a serious chance they'd lose the Frenchman for nothing the following summer. However, a resolution was found at the end of the season with PSG confirming that Mbappe had penned a new three-year extension with the club. The terms of the deal, though, were quite different to what was made out. Mbappe had actually signed a two-year deal which included an option to extend by a further year. Nevertheless, the Frenchman's new deal prevented another saga from developing throughout the summer.  Real Madrid, meanwhile, had just won La Liga and the Champions League with Vinicius Jr and Karim Benzema spearheading their impressive double. Mbappe wasn't seen as an immediate priority. Mbappe's surprise extension left a bitter taste in the mouths of those at Real Madrid, and reports in Spain at the end of 2022, after Mbappe had almost guided France to back-to-back World Cup triumphs, suggested Real's interest in the superstar had cooled.  Vinicius Jr's remarkable development into one of the world's best had lessened the need for Mbappe's arrival, with Perez's ego undoubtedly damaged by his failed pursuits of the PSG man. The Real president certainly wasn't used to not getting what he wanted in the transfer market. Mbappe's relationship with PSG seemed to be at an all-time high following his contract extension which made him a remarkably wealthy man and gave him an unprecedented amount of power at the club. However, as Les Parisiens were enduring another indifferent season which was bound to end in the Ligue 1 title and nothing more, these sweet relations began to sour. Mbappe initially wasn't particularly happy with the club's summer recruitment as they failed to land Robert Lewandowski and Aurelien Tchouameni. Then, in April, Mbappe wasn't best pleased when the club used his image in a promotional video sent to PSG's season ticket holders in a bid to convince them to renew for the 2023/24 campaign. ""I donât agree with this video posted,"" Mbappe protested on Instagram. ð¨| Kylian MbappÃ© has informed PSG that he will not extend his contract by 1 year, meaning his contract will run out next summer pic.twitter.com/z9WfA6J8J2 And here we are.  The latest development in the Mbappe-Real Madrid saga may well spark another summer of unrelenting rumours. Reports have come out of France suggesting Mbappe has no intention of triggering the clause inserted into his PSG contract that'd keep him at the club for an extra year."

Club sources insist that Mbappe, perhaps the most valuable footballer on the planet, will not be allowed to leave for nothing next summer.

Tottenham & Brentford still far apart in valuation of David Raya,"Jun 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-brentford-far-apart-valuation-david-raya,"Tottenham Hotspur and Brentford are no closer to reaching an agreement over a transfer fee for David Raya, sources have told 90min.

Romelu Lukaku & Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang approached over Saudi Arabia moves,"Jun 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/romelu-lukaku-pierre-emerick-aubameyang-approached-saudi-arabia-moves,"Chelsea strikers Romelu Lukaku and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang have both been approached over summer transfers to Saudi Arabia, 90min understands. The duo are facing uncertain futures at Stamford Bridge, with Lukaku set to return from loan with Inter and Aubameyang being placed on the transfer list well before last season came to an end. Both players are on high wages, with Lukaku the highest earner at Chelsea, and so the list of potential buyers is limited. Chelsea co-owner Todd Boehly travelled to Saudi Arabia last week and sources have confirmed to 90min that the American alerted clubs in the Middle East to the availability of both Aubameyang and Lukaku. The Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF), who recently assumed control of Al Ittihad, Al Nassr, Al Hilal and Al Ahli, are now in talks with both strikers in the hope of convincing them to take summer moves to the Saudi Pro League. feed The PIF are confident that they can wrap up a deal for Aubameyang, who is keen to leave Chelsea in the coming weeks. The 33-year-old does, however, have interest from Europe, where former employers Barcelona are open to a reunion, but he is not believed to be a top priority. As for Lukaku, a move for the Belgian is far more complicated. He is keen to remain with Inter, who have also voiced a desire to retain him, but an agreement between the two clubs over either a permanent deal or a second loan is still a long way away. Chelsea are due for further talks with Inter this week, with Lukaku's future on the agenda alongside a number of other topics. The Serie A side are also known admirers of centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly, who could be included in Chelsea's attempts to sign goalkeeper Andre Onana, which will continue during the upcoming meeting. Koulibaly's availability was also discussed during Boehly's meeting with Saudi officials, with the co-owner also seeking to drum up interest in goalkeeper Edouard Mendy and winger Hakim Ziyech as well. The PIF plan to continue their pursuits of both Aubameyang and Lukaku, while they are understood to be open to exploring moves for several other Chelsea players who have been told they are free to leave this summer."
WATCH: Jack Grealish begs Bernardo Silva to snub Barcelona & PSG interest,"Jun 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jack-grealish-begs-bernardo-silva-snub-barcelona-psg-interest,"Manchester City winger Jack Grealish has pleaded with teammate Bernardo Silva to stay at the Etihad Stadium this summer. 90min understands that Silva has once again made it clear to City that he would like to leave the club this summer, and Pep Guardiola is happy to take his usual stance of allowing any unsettled player to leave for the right price. A fee of around Â£75m is expected to be enough to convince City to sell, which may rule long-term suitors Barcelona out of the race. Silva is thought to be prioritising a move to Camp Nou but may be forced to accept an alternative landing spot, with Paris Saint-Germain also in the race. In the meantime, Silva has been celebrating his role in City's famous treble victory alongside social media superstar Grealish, whose celebrations have been just as entertaining as any of the football City played this season. It was during one of these parties that Grealish was seen praying for Silva to stay at the club, appearing to shout 'please don't go' at his teammate. ""Please don't go"" ðJack Grealish begging Bernardo Silva to stay ð pic.twitter.com/aJJbZAYTuR Grealish later admitted: ""There's one person in this team that I absolutely adore, and he looks homeless. His name is Bernardo Silva."" Silva, who still has two years remaining on his contract, confessed after the Champions League final that he was still in the dark over where he would be playing his football next season. ""Honestly, I donât know,"" he told Telefoot. ""Weâll see what happens in the next few weeks and months."" PSG may be forced to ramp up their interest in Silva following the revelation that Kylian Mbappe could leave this summer. The 24-year-old has made it clear he does not plan to extend his contract into 2025 and therefore has just 12 months remaining on his current deal. It leaves PSG forced to consider a sale in the coming months before running the risk of losing perhaps the most valuable player on the planet for free next year."
Arsenal & West Ham make breakthrough in Declan Rice talks,"Jun 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-west-ham-breakthrough-declan-rice-talks,"Arsenal have made a major breakthrough in their pursuit of Declan Rice after agreeing to pay West Ham more than Â£100m for the England midfielder, sources have told 90min. Rice has long been the Gunners' top summer target, but there had been a reluctance to meet the lofty valuation of the Europa Conference League winners, who are standing firm on their insistence that the 24-year-old will only be sold for in excess of Â£100m. But with rivals Chelsea and Bayern Munich circling, 90min understands that Arsenal have pushed ahead in their bid to land Rice and have told West Ham that they will pay more than Â£100m to take their captain to north London. An official offer is yet to be made for Rice but if Arsenal finalise the deal, as they are now expected to do, the 24-year-old will become the most expensive English player of all-time, surpassing Manchester City's deal for Jack Grealish and Real Madrid's summer move for Jude Bellingham. feed West Ham chairman David Sullivan recently confirmed that they plan to sell Rice this summer, having promised the club captain that he is free to leave if the Hammers are fairly compensated for his departure. Clubs from across Europe have been following the situation but Arsenal have made the first move by indicating a willingness to meet West Ham's asking price, with Rice understood to be keen on a move to the Emirates. Progress in negotiations over Rice comes shortly after Arsenal made another major breakthrough, this time in talks with centre-back William Saliba over a new contract. Saliba's current deal has just 12 months left to run and talk over an extension had been dragging on for nearly the entire season, but an agreement over a four-year deal has now been struck to hand Arsenal an enormous boost."
Rasmus Hojlund breaks silence over alleged Man Utd transfer talks,"Jun 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/rasmus-hojlund-breaks-silence-man-utd-transfer-talks,"Rasmus Hojlund has insisted he has not been in contact with Manchester United, though he is flattered by their interest. 90min recently reported that the young Dane is on the Red Devils' shortlist of striker targets for the summer transfer window. His club, Atalanta, would be open to selling Hojlund, but only for a fee north of â¬65m (Â£55m). The Serie A side paid just â¬17m to sign the forward from Sturm Graz last summer. Hojlund, who is currently on international duty with Denmark, was asked on Monday about reports that he has had a video call with Man Utd manager Erik ten Hag to discuss a potential move to Old Trafford. ""There has been no video call. I can't say anything about that."" he told Danish publication Berlingske. ""It's a huge club, so I must have done something right if it says they want me. My goal is to reach the top shelf, and you can say that Manchester United is. So it will be huge."" feed In further quotes relayed by Tipsbladet, Hojlund added: ""As you see and hear, I imagine a lot could happen to quite a few strikers this summer, as many clubs are looking for a No.9. Something will definitely happen there, and then weâll have to wait and see if I am included in it.  ""I am very happy to be with Atalanta and we have qualified for Europe. I have found myself in a really good place here, so now we have to wait and see. Hojlund only turned 20 in February but has quickly announced himself as one of Europe's top up-and-coming strikers. He scored 10 goals in 34 games across all competitions during his debut season with Atalanta, while he has already grabbed five goals in four games for Denmark's senior side. 90min understands that Man Utd are hoping to bring in two strikers this summer - ideally one in their prime and another younger option. Harry Kane, Victor Osimhen, Lautaro Martinez and Dusan Vlahovic are targets to fill the role of the experienced forward, while Hojlund, Evan Ferguson, Santiago Gimenez and Goncalo Ramos are seen as youthful candidates."
Why Real Madrid need Kylian Mbappe's help to facilitate summer transfer,"Jun 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/why-real-madrid-need-kylian-mbappe-help-summer-transfer,"Kylian Mbappe will have to force his way out of Paris Saint-Germain for a reasonable transfer fee if he is to complete a move to Real Madrid this summer, 90min understands. The 24-year-old has informed PSG he will not be signing a new contract or activating an extension clause to take his current deal beyond 2024. The French champions have been stunned by this choice - reports from France even state they were confused by Mbappe's decision to write them a letter explaining his decision - and they face the prospect of letting him leave for free next year or selling him this summer. PSG have already lost Lionel Messi to Inter Miami on a free transfer, while Neymar's future at Parc des Princes is also uncertain amid interest from Saudi Arabia. Mbappe nearly joined Real Madrid as a free agent in 2022 before deciding to stay at PSG, which came as a huge shock to Los Blancos. Sources have told 90min that Real Madrid want to assess Mbappe's situation this summer a little more before making a decision. feed Reports across Europe have already claimed that PSG could command a nine-figure fee for Mbappe and 90min understands Real Madrid are reluctant to get into such a transfer war. Following Karim Benzema's departure to Saudi Pro League champions Al Ittihad, Real Madrid are on the hunt for a new centre forward, with Harry Kane, Lautaro Martinez and Dusan Vlahovic among their targets. 90min understands that Real Madrid would be comfortable prioritising a move for a natural number nine, though they would not have any concerns about fitting Mbappe into a system and believe he is capable of playing through the middle. While ultimately Real Madrid and Mbappe share a mutual interest in making a transfer work, Los Blancos will need the 2022 World Cup Golden Boot winner to help facilitate a move from PSG. Real Madrid president Florentino Perez was recently filmed being asked about whether the club would sign Mbappe, replying: ""Yes, but not this summer."" This was prior to Monday's revelations, however."

Kylian Mbappe tells PSG he won't sign new contract,"Jun 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/kylian-mbappe-tells-psg-wont-sign-new-contract,"Kylian Mbappe has told Paris Saint-Germain he does not intend to sign a new contract or stay at the club beyond 2024, opening the possibility of a summer transfer. Mbappe has attracted heavy interest from Real Madrid over the past few years, but first turned them down in 2022 when he signed a new contract at Parc des Princes. PSG retained the Ligue 1 title but are facing a summer of change with Lionel Messi departing after two seasons and Neymar also courting interest after another injury-plagued campaign. Mbappe was again consistent for the French giants but Champions League glory evaded them in a last 16 exit to Bayern Munich and Mbappe's decision now places further pressure on PSG.  90min understands the club are shocked by Mbappe's decision, which will force them to either sell this summer or let the World Cup winner walk for free in a year. feed The extra year is a mutual option, which means both sides need to agree for it to be exercised.

Bernardo Silva informs Manchester City he wants to leave the club,"Jun 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bernardo-silva-manchester-city-wants-to-leave-club,"Bernardo Silva has reaffirmed to Manchester City that he wants to leave the club this summer, 90min understands.  The 28-year-old, who is contracted to City until 2025, played a crucial role in helping Pep Guardiola's side achieve a historic treble, putting in particularly impressive performances in the Champions League - most notably scoring a brace in the convincing 4-0 win over Real Madrid in the second leg of their heavyweight semi-final. The 1-0 win over Inter in the Champions League final was the 14th trophy of Silva's City career, which started in May 2017 when the Premier League champions agreed to pay Monaco upwards of Â£60m including performance add-ons. But despite City's continued success over the past six years, Silva's future at the club has become increasingly uncertain. He admitted in August 2022, amid strong links to Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain, that although he was happy at City, he had 'no idea what's going to happen' in the future. 90min then revealed in September 2022 that the Portuguese international was one of Barca's priority transfer targets and the Catalan giants even saw a January enquiry turned down by City. Silva previously told City of his intention to seek a new challenge and 90min understands that he has reaffirmed his desire to leave this summer, with the club willing to do business providing they receive an offer around the Â£75m mark. feed Whether or not Barcelona have the financial means to complete a transfer remains to be seen, but 90min understands that Ligue 1 champions PSG see Silva as a potentially ideal replacement for Inter Miami-bound Lionel Messi. Messi had looked to be closing in on a fairy-tale return to Camp Nou after months of speculation and back and forth between agents, but Barca were ultimately unable to get their financial affairs in order to make a move possible. ""Although I heard it was said La Liga had accepted that everything was fine for me to return, there were still many other things that had to be done.Â I heard that [Barcelona] had to sell players or lower player salaries and the truth is that I didn't want to go through that,"" Messi said after announcing his intention to move to MLS. With Messi on his way out of the French capital, PSG are hoping to convince Silva that a return to Ligue 1 is his best option - although at this stage it's believed that a move to Barcelona would be the player's preference. Nevertheless, sources have told 90min that Silva and his representatives have a good relationship with PSG's current Director of Football Luis Campos, having previously worked together at Monaco. Silva famously won the Ligue 1 title with Monaco in 2017, ironically scoring a stunning goal against PSG to end the club's 17-year wait for a top-flight championship."

Chelsea set asking price for Man Utd target Mason Mount,"Jun 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-asking-price-man-utd-mason-mount,"Chelsea will demand Â£70m to part ways with Mason Mount this summer amid interest from Manchester United, 90min understands. Mount will enter the final 12 months of his Chelsea contract this summer and has so far declined to sign an extension, despite new manager Mauricio Pochettino's desire to work with the England international. Chelsea officials have made it clear to Mount that they are prepared to sell him this summer if he does not extend, but sources have confirmed to 90min that the Blues are not prepared to be pressured into lowering their demands. A value of Â£70m has been placed on Mount's head and Chelsea have made it clear they will not sell the 24-year-old if their asking price is not met. That could be bad news for suitors Man Utd, who are keen to land Mount this summer but are currently not willing to offer any higher than Â£50m for his services, given his expiring contract and their need to invest in other areas of the squad. feed Chelsea have not yet given up hope of extending Mount's contract and are willing to sit down once again to try and thrash out an agreement, but no further progress has been made at this point. Any developments will be watched keenly by United, who believe Chelsea could lower their asking price as the summer progresses if they fail to convince Mount to put pen to paper.

Who will Barcelona sign this summer? Every player linked in the transfer window,"Jun 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/who-will-barcelona-sign-this-summer-every-player-linked-transfer-window,"There are certain clubs in world football you are linked with a move for pretty much every single half-decent footballer in the world during transfer windows. Barcelona are one of those football clubs.   While finances have been a big problem for the Blaugrana, they have still been making a lot of moves happen. Here, we'll do our best to tell you who Barcelona are being linked with signing as we start to gear up for the summer transfer window in 2023. feed Despite winning La Liga under Xavi this past season, there are a few areas of the squad that Barcelona know they need to address this summer.  They need to find a new man to take over the base of the midfield with Sergio Busquets leaving the club. Many players have already been linked with that role, while another more-rounded midfielder seems to be a possibility too. There is no natural right-back in the Barcelona squad at the moment so they need at least one player of quality to fill that gap. There could be a lot of movement in the wide areas with the likes of Ferran Torres and Ansu Fati possibly being sold to. Beyond all of that, they need a striker who is willing to be Robert Lewandowski's deputy and can step in for the Pole when he needs to be saved for a bigger game. There has been a remarkable number of players linked with a move to Barcelona early in the summer but in terms of players that they clearly hold a serious interest in, Ilkay Gundogan and Joshua Kimmich are at the top of the list.  The former could be available on a free transfer if he decides not to renew with Man City, while Kimmich will be harder to acquire given that big fee will be required to get him.  Another midfielder being linked heavily with Barcelona is Fiorentina's Sofyan Amrabat. The Moroccan impressed at the World Cup and after a dip in form, has ended the season very well. Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad is another target, as is Joao Cancelo who can fill in the gap at full-back.  The one position where Barcelona do not need any reinforcements is in goal, and they have not been linked with any goalkeepers in recent weeks.

The free transfers Barcelona should target in the summer window,"Jun 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/the-free-transfers-barcelona-should-target-in-the-summer-window,"2022/23 was an odd season for Barcelona. They reclaimed their place at the top of La Liga after four years, but there's still turmoil around the club - especially now that Lionel Messi is not returning. Many parts of the squad seem to need refreshing, there are a number of players that have been deemed surplus to requirements, and there is not a great deal of cash available to spend as they try to make sure they stay in business. That all points to one thing: free transfers. There are a number of very good players that are available to sign without a transfer fee this summer, meaning Barcelona will only have to worry about signing-on fees and wages.   Here are six players that Barcelona could look at signing without spending money on transfer fees. feed This is the obvious option for absolutely every club that can afford his wages. Ilkay Gundogan has been simply sensational for Manchester City this season and has stepped up with so many important goals from midfield.He grabbed both goals in the FA Cup final against Manchester United and he is such an incredibly tidy player. City are trying to keep him but it seems he will be on his way this summer. Barcelona have been linked anyway, but there will be stiff competition.  Another name that has been linked with almost every club under the sun over the past few months, Thuram would be a great option to provide depth in both the wide areas as well as upfront. The Frenchman is set to leave Borussia Monchengladbach this summer, with likes of AC Milan reportedly being interested in his services. With Barcelona seemingly keen to move on some forward players, Thuram could be a perfect replacement for the likes of Ferran Torres.  This is almost a combination of Ilkay Gundogan and Marcus Thuram. Roberto Firmino is a quality player who would undoubtedly be of serious use to Barcelona, and he also addresses a genuine needs in the squad too. It is not yet clear where Firmino is going to end up playing next season, but he still has so much to offer a top team in Europe. A player who has been destined to leave Lyon for a very long time now, various big clubs have been linked with a move for Moussa Dembele. If Barcelona can convince Dembele to be a deputy to Robert Lewandowski next season, they could have a very strong backup striker who can lighten the load on the Pole who, while still looking extremely fit, has to age at some point soon."
Alphonso Davies reveals details of failed Barcelona transfer,"Jun 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/alphonso-davies-reveals-details-of-failed-barcelona-transfer,"Bayern Munich star Alphonso Davies has revealed how Barcelona turned down the opportunity to sign him prior to his move to the Bundesliga.  Davies joined Bayern for a then-record fee for an MLS player of $22m, joining from Vancouver Whitecaps in January 2019.  Since them, the Canadian international has become one of the best full-backs in the world, winning five Bundesliga titles, two DFB-Pokals and one UEFA Champions League during his time with the Bavarian club.  Speaking on podcast 'Say Less', Davies has revealed that he could have made a move to Catalunya instead of Bavaria afer leaving MLS footballer, saying that Barcelona approached him but ultimately then-president Josep Bartomeu renegged on the deal because of the player's nationality:  feed âBarcelona approached me but the president [Josep Bartomeu] didnât want me because Iâm from Canada. This was what the press said, I donât know if the President really said that, but Iâm not going to lie, it kind of crushed my feelings.â La Blaugrana are currently in the market for a full-back after the mutual termination of Jordi Alba's contract at the end of the 2022/23 season.  90min understands that the club are monitoring Joao Cancelo's situation at Manchester City and Bayern Munich. While Bayern are keen to keep hold of the Portuguese international, they are unwilling to pay anywhere near their â¬70m option to buy the player this summer thus potentially paving the way for Barca to swoop in and secure his services.

Arsenal have already wrapped up the futures of Gabriel Martinelli, Bukayo Saka and Aaron Ramsdale, and tying Saliba down to a new deal will come as an enormous boost for Arteta's plans to keep his young core together. Winger Reiss Nelson is also understood to have agreed an extension of his own ahead of the expiry of his current deal this summer."
Brahim Diaz signs new Real Madrid contract after AC Milan loan,"Jun 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/brahim-diaz-signs-new-real-madrid-contract-ac-milan-loan,"Real Madrid have confirmed Brahim Diaz has signed a new four-year contract upon his return to the club. Los Blancos parted with an initial Â£15.5m to sign Diaz from Manchester City in January 2019 but watched as the Spanish youngster struggled to make an impact, eventually sending him out on a one-year loan to AC Milan in the summer of 2020. Diaz would later return to Milan on a fresh two-year loan deal, during which he established himself as a key player for the Serie A side, winning the league title in 2021/22, and he has now returned to Spain to take up a role in Real Madrid's first team once again. Upon his return, Diaz has inked a new deal to tie himself to Los Blancos until the summer of 2027. The 23-year-old will be presented to the media once again on Tuesday, 13 June. feed Diaz made 21 appearances for Real Madrid during his first 18 months on the books, chipping in with two goals and three assists and spending most of his time on the bench or out the squad. His loan to Milan afforded Diaz the opportunity to reignite his career and he leaves Italy as a Serie A champion having racked up no fewer than 124 appearances for the Rossoneri. 2022/23 was the most productive season of Diaz's senior career. The Spaniard bagged six goals and seven assists for Milan, playing largely in an attacking midfield role but also appearing on the left wing occasionally. Diaz's return to Real Madrid will help fill the void left by the departures of Karim Benzema, Eden Hazard, Marco Asensio and Mariano Diaz."
Ruben Loftus-Cheek's AC Milan transfer in limbo after Paolo Maldini exit,"Jun 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ruben-loftus-cheek-ac-milan-transfer-limbo-paolo-maldini-exit,"AC Milan have cooled their pursuit of Chelsea midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek following departures of directors Paolo Maldini and Frederic Massara, 90min understands. Maldini had been leading talks with Chelsea over a move for Loftus-Cheek, who had been expected to seal a Â£15m switch to San Siro before the shock decision from Milan to part ways with their directorial duo. The new-look Rossoneri board are now understood to be re-evaluating their transfer strategy for the summer and sources have confirmed to 90min they have halted their pursuit of Loftus-Cheek as a result. Instead, Milan's current focus is on completing a deal for impending free agent Daichi Kamada, who reached an agreement over a contract with Maldini and is expected to honour that. Chelsea have not given up hope of convincing Milan to move ahead with their original plans to sign Loftus-Cheek, who has just 12 months remaining on his contract. The Blues also have an option to extend his deal for a further year to help facilitate a loan move. feed Chelsea officials are keen to do some form of business with Milan, who were previously interested in a number of Blues players before Maldini's departure. Kalidou Koulibaly, Hakim Ziyech and Callum Hudson-Odoi were all on Milan's initial radar, as was Christian Pulisic, who has been offered around Serie A as Chelsea seek a permanent departure which would benefit everyone involved. As part of their talks with Maldini's Milan, Chelsea registered their interest in Rossoneri goalkeeper Mike Maignan, who recently posted a cryptic message on social media in an apparent show of support for his former director. Chelsea's approach over Maignan was swiftly rebuffed and it is not yet known whether they will continue to push for a move for the Frenchman. Inter's Andre Onana is an alternative target."
Man Utd fear Harry Maguire transfer stance could impact Kim Min-jae plan,"Jun 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-fear-harry-maguire-transfer-stance-impact-kim-min-jae-plan,"Manchester United are concerned their plans to sign a new elite defender could be scuppered if Harry Maguire refuses to accept an exit from Old Trafford, 90min understands. Still the most expensive defender of all time after his move from Leicester in 2019, Maguire dropped down the pecking order in Erik ten Hag's debut season with Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane the preferred centre-back combination. 90min previously revealed Tottenham have shortlisted the England international while his agents believe a move to Serie A, where Juventus and Inter have shown interest, would be his best option. Other Premier League sides like Newcastle and West Ham are also monitoring the situation, though 90min understands Maguire is keen to battle for a more regular starting XI spot. United are keen to add another defender to their ranks and have held talks with Napoli's Kim Min-jae, who has a clause in his contract which allows him to leave for less than Â£50m at the start of July. If Maguire refuses to budge, United may change their transfer strategy in defence. feed Some club officials still hope to draft in another centre-back regardless of Maguire's stance or the future of Victor Lindelof. The Swede is known to have impressed Ten Hag in the backend of the season when Martinez and Varane were sidelined by injuries. Maguire is contracted at Man Utd until 2025 with the option of another year and his England credentials have not been harmed as of yet by his reduced playing time under Ten Hag. However, Three Lions manager Gareth Southgate admitted in May it would be difficult to keep picking the 30-year-old if he continues to go unused at Old Trafford. Maguire started eight Premier League games in 2022/23 and was a regular in United's cup XI both domestically and in the Europa League. "
Arsenal reluctant to meet West Ham's asking price for Declan Rice,"Jun 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-reluctant-meet-west-ham-asking-price-declan-rice,"Arsenal are leading the race to sign West Ham midfielder Declan Rice but are not yet prepared to meet the Hammers' asking price for their captain, 90min understands. West Ham expect to receive plenty of offers for Rice, who is also attracting interest from Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United and Bayern Munich, now that their Europa Conference League campaign has come to an end. Club chairman David Sullivan has confirmed the Hammers have promised to part ways with Rice this summer, with the 24-year-old ready to move on. An asking price of Â£100m has been placed on Rice's head and West Ham believe the midfielder could end up commanding a higher fee if a bidding war can be sparked. 90min understands Arsenal are wary of paying so much and instead value Rice at closer to Â£90m, and the Gunners would be looking to strike a deal that would see them pay an initial Â£80m with add-ons to take the price higher. feed That difference in valuation has left the door open for one of Rice's many suitors to come to the negotiating table, but sources have confirmed that Arsenal remain confident that they will win the race for Rice's signature. Those in charge at the Emirates Stadium believe Arsenal is Rice's preferred destination and there is confidence that will help the Gunners fend off any competition if a transfer battle arises. Despite not yet finding a side prepared to meet their demands, West Ham have conducted serious work in anticipation of losing Rice and have drawn up a shortlist of targets to pursue if and when they end up cashing in on their captain. A late move for Ajax midfielder Edson Alvarez has been launched, while Manchester City's Kalvin Phillips and Fulham's Joao Palhinha are both admired."

Chelsea's Mason Mount, Bayern Munich's Ryan Gravenberch, Wolves' Ruben Neves and former Leicester man Youri Tielemans are all on Liverpool's lengthy shortlist as well as the Reds seek to continue their midfield rebuild. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, James Milner and Naby Keita have all left the club this summer, with the latter inking a deal to return to the Bundesliga with Werder Bremen. Arthur has also returned to Juventus after his loan expired. Another midfielder, 20-year-old Fabio Carvalho, will be allowed to leave on loan this summer amid frustrations over his limited minutes last season."

West Ham consider midfield trio as Declan Rice replacement hunt intensifies,"Jun 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-consider-midfield-trio-declan-rice-replacement-hunt-intensifies,"West Ham United have made a late move to try and snatch Ajax defensive midfielder Edson Alvarez away from the clutches of Borussia Dortmund, 90min understands, while bids for Kalvin Phillips and Joao Palhinha are also being considered. The Hammers ended their 43-year trophy drought on Wednesday night when Jarrod Bowen's last-minute winner earned a 2-1 win over Fiorentina in the Europa Conference League final staged at Prague's Eden Arena. Declan Rice became just the third West Ham captain to hoist major silverware above his head, following in the footsteps of club legends Bobby Moore and Billy Bonds, but the game is expected to be his last in claret and blue amid a glut of Premier League interest. 90min understands West Ham are braced for bids to come in for Rice - Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United all interested in signing the 24-year-old who is valued at Â£100m - and majority owner David Sullivan revealed on Thursday the club had 'promised' to let him leave to further his ambitions. Mexico international Alvarez was linked with Manchester United and Chelsea last summer but ended up staying at Ajax, who faltered in the Eredivisie last season after Erik ten Hag's departure. 90min revealed in May that Borussia Dortmund were confident of tying up a deal worth Â£30m to take Alvarez to the Bundesliga this summer - BVB have money to spend after agreeing to sell Jude Bellingham to Real Madrid for well over Â£100m - but sources have revealed West Ham have made a late move and held talks with the player's agent. feed The Hammers also showed interest in Alvarez last summer and the expectation is they will follow through with a bid to test Ajax's valuation.

The 27-year-old penned a six-year contract when he joined in a deal worth Â£45m last summer but played just 291 minutes of Premier League football for the champions. An offer could also be forthcoming for Joao Palhinha, with his stock at an all-time high after an impressive debut season in the Premier League. The Portuguese international arrived at Fulham for just Â£20m last summer but his value has soared after a string of commanding performances in the heart of Marco Silva's midfield. West Ham will be able to offer Europa League football to any prospective new signing next season - their Europa Conference League winning exploits making up for a difficult Premier League campaign that yielded 20 defeats and a 14th place finish."
Alphonso Davies' agent admits contact with 'other clubs' as Man City & Real Madrid show interest ,"Jun 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/alphonso-davies-agent-admits-contact-clubs-man-city-real-madrid-interest,"The agent of Bayern Munich left-back Alphonso Davies has confessed he has held talks with other clubs as uncertainty over the Canada international's future continues to swirl. Davies had been expected to sign a new contract at the Allianz Arena towards the end of the campaign, but the departures of directors Oliver Kahn and Hasan Salihamidzic have seen talks over an extension stall. The 22-year-old still has two years remaining on his contract in Munich but 90min understands both Manchester City and Real Madrid have registered their interest in signing Davies, and now the full-back's agent has admitted to holding talks with interested sides. ""I have spoken to other clubs â they have texted and spoken to us; but we haven't had any in-depth conversations with anybody,"" agent Nick Huoseh told TSN. ""He is with Bayern Munich. He has two years remaining on his contract. We don't know what will happen in a year from now. ""He's happy at Bayern.

"Lautaro Martinez attracting interest from Real Madrid, Chelsea & Man Utd","Jun 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/lautaro-martinez-interest-real-madrid-chelsea-man-utd,"Real Madrid, Chelsea and Manchester United have all registered an interest in Inter striker Lautaro Martinez, who is expected to leave Italy after Saturday's Champions League final, 90min understands. The 25-year-old is enjoying the best season of his Inter career, racking up 21 goals and seven assists in Serie A, and will hope to add to his tally when the Nerazzurri take on Manchester City in the European finale in Istanbul. Europe's financial heavyweights have long been keen on Martinez, but sources have now confirmed to 90min that the Argentine's representatives have spoken to a number of clubs to inform them that Martinez is ready for a new challenge this summer. Chelsea and United, who have been following Martinez's career for years now, have registered their interest in a summer deal but they will have to fend off interest from Real Madrid if they are to bring him to the Premier League. Like the English duo, Real are long-term admirers of Martinez but Los Blancos have ramped up their interest in recent days as they prepare for a dramatic overhaul in attack. feed Karim Benzema, Eden Hazard, Marco Asensio and Mariano Diaz have all left the club this summer, leaving Real Madrid on the hunt for significant reinforcements. Chelsea's Kai Havertz is under consideration but concerns over his asking price have prevented any approach thus far. Real Madrid's preferred striker target is Tottenham's Harry Kane, who is also at the top of United's wish list, but 90min understands that Spurs are determined not to sell the England international this summer, forcing both clubs to look elsewhere. As such, the two clubs are exploring all their options and Martinez, who Inter expect to depart the club after the Champions League final, is emerging as a viable target not only for United and Real Madrid, but also for Chelsea. Mauricio Pochettino's side, who are following Kane's situation in their own search for a new striker, are in near-constant contact with Inter over various issues, namely Romelu Lukaku's future and their interest in goalkeeper Andre Onana.

Napoli's Victor Osimhen is another of significant interest to the two Premier League sides but his price tag is expected to be well over â¬100m."
Paul Pogba emerges as major target for Saudi Pro League,"Jun 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/paul-pogba-target-saudi-arabia-pro-league,"Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba is the latest blockbuster target for Saudi Arabia's Pro League, sources have told 90min. Karim Benzema left Real Madrid to join Al Ittihad on Tuesday on a three-year deal and N'Golo Kante is close to joining him, and there's expected to be a wave of big-name players who follow their lead by joining Cristiano Ronaldo in the Middle East - he made the high-profile switch at the beginning of 2023. Chiefs in Saudi Arabia want to add more of Europe's elite talent to their ranks and sources have confirmed to 90min that Pogba is firmly on their radar. The 30-year-old has endured an injury and controversy-riddled campaign following his return to Juventus last summer from Manchester United. The Frenchman started just one Serie A game last season, while he was dropped from Juventus' squad for their Europa League knockout tie with Freiburg because of disciplinary issues' earlier in the year. Despite his struggles Pogba has insisted that he wants to remain in Turin and prove his worth, but Juve themselves have endured a tumultuous campaign beset with off-field controversies. Those ultimately spilled out on to the field in the form of a ten-point deduction for financial irregularities. manual Juventus are now looking at a potential rebuild this summer - they will play in the Europa Conference League qualifiers next year after missing out on Champions League and Europa League football - and that could lead to the potential departure of Pogba, who is one of their highest earners. The opportunity to offload Pogba to Saudi Arabia may prove to be tempting for Juve, while a potential transfer would be another significant coup for the Pro League. All of the big-name signings secured so far have been free transfers but with the nation's Public Investment Fund (PIF), who also own Newcastle United, pumping funds into the Pro League's top four clubs - Al Ittihad, Al Ahli, Al Nassr and Al Hilal - they will have no issues in paying substantial fees for any future targets. Benzema has moved to Saudi Arabia on a deal worth in excess of Â£250,000-a-day without tax - Kante will follow suit when he officially puts pen to paper - and Pogba can expect a similar pay day should he end up making the move to the Middle East."
Real Madrid confirm re-signing of former academy graduate,"Jun 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/real-madrid-confirm-signing-former-academy-graduate,"Real Madrid have completed the signing of left-back Fran Garcia from Rayo Vallecano on a four-year deal. Manager Carlo Ancelotti confirmed towards the end of this season that the club had activated their option to re-sign Garcia, who came through the Real academy before joining Vallecano on loan in 2020. That move became permanent 12 months later. After two impressive years away from the Santiago Bernabeu, Garcia is heading back to his boyhood side. The 23-year-old left-back, who bagged two goals and three assists for Vallecano last season as he missed just 21 minutes of the La Liga campaign, has signed a four-year deal in Madrid and will offer immediate competition on that side of defence. feed Garcia has already spoken openly about his plans back with Real, giving fans an insight into what they can expect from him next season. Left-back has been a tricky position for Ancelotti. Usual starter Ferland Mendy has regularly struggled with injuries and, with the versatile David Alaba also sidelined for parts of last season, it was over to versatile midfielder Eduardo Camavinga to help out at the back. While Camavinga enjoyed some excellent run-outs at full-back, he has made it clear that he sees his future in his preferred position of midfield, and the arrival of Garcia should help the Frenchman stick to his favourite role. Garcia becomes the first signing of the summer for Real, who are expected to follow this one up with the â¬100m acquisition of Jude Bellingham from Borussia Dortmund."

Tottenham open talks with Leicester over Newcastle target James Maddison,"Jun 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-open-talks-leicester-newcastle-target-james-maddison,"Tottenham have opened talks with Leicester over James Maddison as they look to beat Newcastle to his signature, 90min understands. The 26-year-old registered ten goals and nine assists during the 2022/23 Premier League campaign as the Foxes were surprisingly relegated to the Championship. Maddison has been a long-term target for Newcastle while Spurs' interest dates back to the playmaker's days at Championship play-off finalists Coventry and Norwich. 90min revealed on Tuesday that incoming Spurs manager Ange Postecoglou has already given his approval for the pursuit of Maddison to continue in the summer transfer window, and sources have confirmed that talks are now underway with Leicester. Leicester are looking for a fee of between Â£55m and Â£60m for the two-cap England international, whose entourage has also been spoken to by Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal over the last six months, and it appears Spurs are now going head-to-head with Newcastle for his signature. The Magpies are considering moves for a number of players at the three teams who were relegated and still want Maddison, who was the subject of a failed Â£50m bid last summer. However, 90min understands they are reluctant to offer much more than that sum at this stage. feed Tottenham have now started negotiating with Leicester as they look to spruce up their midfield options. A lack of creativity hindered Spurs throughout the 2022/23 season before their embarrassing implosion, while Newcastle reached the Champions League thanks in part to the efforts of Bruno Guimaraes, Joelinton and Joe Willock. Spurs are ready to offer a salary comparable to star striker Harry Kane, while Newcastle would make him the joint-highest earner at the club alongside Guimaraes.. A move to Spurs would see Maddison link up more frequently with England captain Harry Kane. Both were included in the 2022 World Cup squad and are also in line to feature in Euro 2024 qualifiers against Malta and North Macedonia this month. Kane's own future has been the subject of fierce scrutiny with Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Manchester United among those keen, but 90min understands Tottenham have told the 29-year-old he will not leave north London this summer."
Karim Benzema reveals key factor in ditching Real Madrid for Al Ittihad,"Jun 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/karim-benzema-reveals-key-factor-ditching-real-madrid-al-ittihad,"Karim Benzema has said the opportunity to live in a muslim country played a key role in persuading him to move to Saudi Arabia. The 35-year-old's decision to leave Real Madrid at the end of his contract shocked the footballing world, with many expecting the Frenchman to extend his stay at the Santiago Bernabeu by at least another 12 months. But after meeting with Real Madrid president Florentino Perez, Benzema opted to take up the offer of moving to Saudi Arabia, penning a three-year deal with champions Al Ittihad on Tuesday. Benzema's arrival could spark a mass exodus from Europe's top five leagues to Saudi Arabia, as a number of other high-profile players have also received lucrative offers. N'Golo Kante and Wilfried Zaha are close to joining Al Ittihad and Al Nassr respectively, while 90min understands Neymar's representatives have held talks over a move to the Middle East. Al Ittihad unveiled Benzema as their marquee new arrival on Thursday, where the 2022 Ballon d'Or winner admitted his religion had played a role in deciding his future. ""Well, because I'm muslim and this is a muslim country, and I have always wanted to live here,"" Benzema told the club's media channels. manual ""I'm so ready to show my talent in this new challenge, there are so many big names play here in this league - Cristiano Ronaldo and now me,"" he continued.  ""So, it's very important to show that Saudi football can have a global impact, because it's not only about playing well here, I should bring the success I managed to achieve in Europe and play the same way I used to do with Real Madrid. ""[Ronaldo] is my friend and he is here. It's amazing to see him here in Saudi Arabia, also he represents the new era of football in this country and the progress that's happening here, which is important on the international level."" Benzema previously indicated he planned on retiring at Real Madrid, but the unexpected opportunity to move to Saudi Arabia, where he will become one of the highest-paid players in world football, changed his plans after consulting with his family."
Liverpool director sends warning to Man Utd & Real Madrid over Harry Kane pursuit,"Jun 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-director-warning-man-utd-real-madrid-harry-kane,"Any club that signs Tottenham striker Harry Kane this summer would be one that 'doesnât care about value for money' according to the leader of Liverpool's transfer analysis team, Dr Ian Graham. Kane is set to enter the final 12 months of his contract with Spurs this summer and has attracted serious interest from Manchester United and Real Madrid, although 90min understands chairman Daniel Levy has made it clear he has no intentions of selling his star striker this summer regardless of how much money is offered. Even if Levy could be convinced to sell Kane, it would take an enormous transfer fee which would put Kane among the most expensive players in history - the sort of deal which Graham, Liverpool's director of research, believes would be a huge risk. Asked which club will end up signing Kane this summer, Graham told the Cheltenham Science Festival: ""A club that doesnât care about value for money."" Graham added: ""Heâs 29. Itâs going to be a high transfer fee for three years of performance that might start declining. feed ""From a data point of view, itâs magnificent the way Alex Ferguson constructed a team that was ageing just as he left [Manchester United]. It really did cement his legacy."" Kane has been told he will not be sold this summer as Spurs still hope to convince the striker to sign a contract extension next season before he is able to leave the club on a free transfer.  Graham, who will leave Liverpool this summer after 11 years as part of the club's transfer analysis team, also took the time to crush any slim hopes the Reds may have of landing long-time social media target Kylian Mbappe. ""Unfortunately, financially, out of Liverpoolâs league,"" he said of the Paris Saint-Germain forward."
Bayern Munich confirm signing of Konrad Laimer from RB Leipzig,"Jun 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-confirm-signing-konrad-laimer-rb-leipzig,"Bayern Munich have confirmed the long-awaited arrival of midfielder Konrad Laimer from RB Leipzig on a free transfer. Laimer was a target for Premier League sides last summer as he approached the end of his contract in Leipzig but Bayern also lodged their interest and have been confident of wrapping up a deal for the Austria international for months. It has been one of the worst-kept secrets in football but now Bayern have finally made Laimer's move to Munich official, tying the 26-year-old down to a four-year contract. ""It's a dream come true for me,"" Laimer said after completing his move. ""FC Bayern is one of the biggest clubs in the world.  ""I will give everything for the club and the fans. FC Bayern always has the highest goals - just like me. I'm in the right place here. I'm only capable of giving 100%, and that's what I'll put into every training session from day one. I can hardly wait."" feed Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen added: ""We are delighted to have signed Konrad Laimer. He comes to us as a two-time DFB Cup winner - and together we will now hopefully celebrate many more great victories and titles here at FC Bayern."" Laimer becomes Bayern's first signing of the summer, and the Thomas Tuchel era, and could be followed by a new striker as the Bundesliga champions look to add more firepower in attack. Eintracht Frankfurt's Randal Kolo Muani is seen as a likely target, with Tottenham's Harry Kane expected to be too expensive, although the Frenchman has recently teased a potential move to the Premier League instead. Also heading to England from Germany could be Bayern right-back Benjamin Pavard who, with one year remaining on his contract, has made it clear he would like to leave this summer."

Newcastle ready to raid relegated Premier League clubs,"Jun 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/newcastle-ready-to-raid-relegated-premier-league-clubs,"Newcastle United intend to bolster Eddie Howe's squad with up to half a dozen new signings, 90min understands, with a number of recently relegated players among those under consideration. The Magpies booked a place in next season's Champions League after securing a top-four Premier League finish - the first time they will have appeared in the competition for 20 years. Around Â£150m was spent on new players over the course of the 2022/23 season - Nick Pope, Sven Botman, Alexander Isak and Anthony Gordon among those to arrive - and sources have confirmed to 90min that the spending will continue to ensure the club remain competitive at a high level. Among the positions on the club's shopping list are a right-sided centre-back, a left-back, two central midfielders and a wide forward, and there's some potential bargains to be had from the teams who have been relegated not only from the Premier League but also from Europe's other top five leagues. The most high-profile targets are Leicester City duo James Maddison and Harvey Barnes, who have both been on the club's radar for a long time. The former was the subject of a Â£50m from Newcastle last summer, which was turned down, and he remains one of the club's priorities. Interest in Barnes was first reported by 90min in April - a result of his outstanding form in a Leicester side who eventually dropped out of the top-flight just two years after winning the FA Cup. The 25-year-old scored 13 Premier League goals during 2022/23 and is a two-footed player capable of cutting inside the full-back or driving to the byline. Tottenham will provide competition for both player's signatures, while West Ham and Aston Villa are also keen admirers of Barnes. Newcastle have also shown interest in a quintet of Southampton players who are likely to leave St Mary's this summer following their relegation. Captain James Ward-Prowse is perhaps the highest profile player of interest, while versatile full-back Kyle Walker-Peters is another who has garnered attention from some of the Premier League's top clubs. Teenage prodigy Romeo Lavia is another player being followed by Newcastle and a host of other top Premier League sides - 90min reported in April that the Saints will look to cash in on the Belgian. Enquiries have also been made over 20-year-old Argentine playmaker Carlos Alcaraz, who has been at Southampton for less than six months after joining from Racing Club, and 21-year-old centre-back Armel Bolla-Kotchap, who made his senior international debut for Germany last year. Alcaraz may cost Newcastle as much as Â£25m should they wish to pursue a deal - double what Southampton paid - while Bolla-Kotchap still has three years remaining on his contract. Leeds' demise from the Premier League is likely to see a number of their international players leave, with central midfielder Tyler Adams among those to have impressed Newcastle. The tenacious American was a key figure until a hamstring injury ended his season with 12 games remaining - Leeds picked up just eight points from a possible 36 without him in the side. Brenden Aaronson, Adams' international teammate with the United States, is another player admired by Newcastle, likewise Jack Harrison - the Magpies tried to sign him last summer but were unable to agree terms. He signed a new contract at Elland Road this year, after a deadline day move to Leicester fell through, but Newcastle may look to test Leeds' resolve with a summer bid. Newcastle have also been impressed by the versatility offered by Robin Koch, who can play in either central defence or just in front of the back four. The German international is just 26 and has been at Elland Road for three seasons. Another long-term Newcastle target relegated on the continent was teenage right-back Ivan Fresneda - a player the club have previously held talks with. His release clause of â¬40m has halved because of Real Valladolid's relegation from La Liga, but Arsenal, Aston Villa and Borussia Dortmund will provide stiff competition for the 18-year-old Spaniard's signature."
Xavi makes Barcelona summer transfer demand,"Jun 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/xavi-makes-barcelona-summer-transfer-demand,"Barcelona coach Xavi has called on the club to sign two midfielders in the summer transfer window, both to replace departing captain Sergio Busquets and also improved depth options. Busquets is set to join Inter Miami, alongside former Camp Nou teammates Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez for a new challenge outside Europe. But he takes 15 years of experience and over 720 first-team appearances with him out of the club. With Gavi and Pedri continuing to both establish themselves among the next generation of global superstars, Xavi is looking to further develop his midfield off the back of La Liga glory this past season and a renewed Champions League title in 2023/24 after successive group stage exits. ""I lack [the] inside game [in midfield].Â The departure of Sergio Busquets is a big problem for me.Â Frenkie has stepped up, but I need creative players in midfield,"" the boss said. feed ""You have to go for a high-level substitute,"" he added on the need for depth. ""You have to prioritise if the club has financial problems.Â And the first is the pivot and the second is a play-maker.Â The rest we'll see how far we'll go."" Barcelona are hoping to sign Ilkay Gundogan on a free transfer this summer. His contract with Manchester City is due to expire this month and no fresh deal has been agreed. Gundogan's City teammate Bernardo Silva is another on the radar but could cost Â£75m. There have additionally been conversations regarding Joshua Kimmich, who is considering his Bayern Munich future after becoming unsettled. He still has another two years left on his contract at the Allianz Arena and could equally command a big fee as a result."
Jude Bellingham passes Real Madrid medical,"Jun 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jude-bellingham-passes-real-madrid-medical,"Jude Bellingham has completed his medical with Real Madrid as he nears a blockbuster move to the Santiago Bernabeu, 90min understands. Los Blancos have agreed to pay an initial â¬100m, plus significant add-ons, to land the 19-year-old midfielder's signature, fending off competition from across Europe to get a deal done. Bellingham recently travelled to Madrid for medical checks, including tests on a knee injury which could rule him out of England's upcoming Euro 2024 qualifiers against Malta and North Macedonia. While a final decision on whether Bellingham may need surgery has not yet been taken, 90min understands that the teenager has now completed his medical exams and is one step closer to sealing his transfer from Germany to Spain. feed Real Madrid hope to be able to announce Bellingham's signing later this week ahead of a media presentation in the days that follow. With Bellingham's arrival inching closer to completion, Real Madrid can start to focus on their pressing need to recruit in attack after the quartet of Karim Benzema, Marco Asensio, Eden Hazard and Mariano Diaz all left the club on free transfers. Brahim Diaz has returned from his loan with AC Milan and is expected to sign a new contract ahead of taking a role in Carlo Ancelotti's first team. Elsewhere, Real Madrid are keen to sign Tottenham striker Harry Kane, whose asking price could prove difficult to meet following the signing of Bellingham, while they have also distanced themselves from Chelsea's Kai Havertz due to concerns about his valuation."
Neymar attracting interest from Saudi Arabia as Xavi rejects Barcelona return,"Jun 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/neymar-interest-saudi-arabia-xavi-rejects-barcelona-return,"Neymar's representatives have held talks over a move to Saudi Arabia, 90min understands, with a shock return to Barcelona ruled out by manager Xavi. The 31-year-old has two years remaining on his Paris Saint-Germain contract, with the Ligue 1 giants having the option to extend by a further 12 months. But the flamboyant Brazilian has been targeted by a section of PSG supporters who are disgruntled with his on-field performances and there were recent protests outside of his house by ultras demanding he leave the club this summer. 90min revealed at the beginning of May that Newcastle's owners, PIF, were exploring the possibility of taking Neymar to Tyneside - a potential first blockbuster signing in the North East as they build on the success of qualifying for next season's Champions League - and it's believed that he would prefer to remain in Europe if he leaves PSG. However, sources have confirmed to 90min that talks have been held with Neymar's representatives by a delegation representing the Saudi Pro League, who are interested in making him the next marquee arrival in the Middle East. Karim Benzema joined Al Ittihad from Real Madrid on a three-year deal on Tuesday, while N'Golo Kante and a host of other players are also being offered huge sums of money to follow in the footsteps of Cristiano Ronaldo, who joined Al Nassr at the back end of 2022 to elevate Saudi Arabia into the footballing limelight. feed 90min further understands that Neymar has been offered to Barcelona - who missed out on re-signing Lionel Messi after he opted to join Inter Miami - but manager Xavi has denied having any interest in re-signing him, telling Twitch channel Jijantes FC of the rumours: ""Iâm surprisedâ¦ heâs not in our plan.  ""I really like Ney as a friend, but we have different priorities."" Neymar previously spent four trophy-laden seasons at Camp Nou between 2013 and 2017, winning a famous treble in 2015, before making a world record â¬222m move to PSG. He has won a catalogue of Ligue 1 titles in the French capital, but has been unable to help PSG win a maiden Champions League crown despite playing alongside Messi and Kylian Mbappe for the last two seasons. Much of Neymar's time in Paris has actually been spent on the sidelines injured, with various ailments limiting him to just 112 Ligue 1 appearances in six full seasons at the club. Manchester United and Chelsea are also being kept informed over Neymar's situation, 90min can confirm, with PSG willing to sanction an exit this summer should they receive an offer in the region of Â£75m."
Chelsea consider double swoop for Moises Caicedo & Declan Rice,"Jun 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-consider-double-swoop-moises-caicedo-declan-rice,"Chelsea could try to sign both Brighton's Moises Caicedo and West Ham's Declan Rice as their need for midfield reinforcements grows stronger, 90min understands. With N'Golo Kante walking away on a free transfer to join Saudi Arabian side Al-Ittihad, Chelsea are prepared to lose at least four of their senior midfielders this summer. Alongside Kante, Mateo Kovacic and Ruben Loftus-Cheek are in talks over permanent moves to Manchester City and AC Milan, respectively, while Denis Zakaria has returned to Juventus after Chelsea declined to turn his loan into a permanent deal. As a result, midfield reinforcements are a high priority this summer and Chelsea, who have already missed out on the signing of Manuel Ugarte to Paris Saint-Germain, now have both Caicedo and Rice in their sights. 90min understands that Chelsea are pushing to strike a deal for Caicedo and have not yet ruled out launching a simultaneous move for Rice to bolster in midfield. feed The Blues are well aware of the level of interest in both players from elsewhere. Caicedo is high on the wish list of Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, who is also known to be keen to lure Rice to the Emirates Stadium this summer. The Gunners are understood to be leading the race for the England international. Manchester City, Manchester United and Bayern Munich are also monitoring Rice, who is expected to be the subject of significant bids now that West Ham's Europa Conference League campaign has come to a triumphant end. Rice is valued in excess of Â£100m and West Ham are prepared to stand firm on that figure. His current contract runs until 2024 but the Hammers have the option to extend that by a further 12 months. Brighton's demands for Caicedo are not expected to be as high, with an Â£80m fee thought to be enough to secure the signature of the Ecuador international."
Liverpool confirm shirt number for Alexis Mac Allister,"Jun 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-confirm-shirt-number-alexis-mac-allister,"Liverpool have confirmed new signing Alexis Mac Allister will wear the number 10 shirt most recently associated with Sadio Mane. The 24-year-old has arrived at Anfield on a long-term contract after rising to prominence with Brighton & Hove Albion over the past three seasons. Mac Allister also played a crucial role in Argentina's World Cup success last December, scoring the opening goal against Poland in a vital group stage win. He previously wore the number 10 shirt at the AMEX Stadium and will do so again on Merseyside, with the number vacant last season after Sadio Mane's surprise departure to Bayern Munich. The Senegalese international wore the number for four seasons after originally taking 19 upon his arrival from Southampton. Philippe Coutinho, Luis Garcia, Michael Owen and John Barnes are four recognisable names to have worn 10 since regular squad numbers were introduced, and manager Jurgen Klopp revealed to Liverpool's official website how much of a boost Mac Allister's signing is for the club. ""We are adding a very talented, very smart, very technically skilled boy to our squad and this is super news, really it is,"" Klopp said. ""I do not think the football world needs me to say too much about Alexis' qualities because they are already pretty well known but it is clear that he is someone who can play in a number of positions in the midfield and is an all-rounder, I would say. He is calm and composed and someone with proper game intelligence. feed ""My admiration and respect for what Brighton are doing is well known and Alexis has been a part of the journey that they have been on in becoming one of the toughest and best sides in the Premier League. ""I'm really happy his next steps will now be with us and we get to work with a player who is already excellent and experienced, but also has so much more to come given he is just 24 years old. ""He is just as excited to be joining and working with us and that already makes it a good partnership, but there is no pressure on him. He is still so young, so it is obvious he will only improve and our job is to help him take the next steps. ""I'm grateful to everyone at the club who helped make this transfer happen and I am sure I speak for everyone here when I say I cannot wait to start working with Alexis."" In addition to Mac Allister, 90min understands Liverpool hope to add a further two midfielders to their squad in a bid to challenge for next season's Premier League title. Manu Kone and Khephren Thuram are two players the club are actively in talks with over potential moves, although they do have a number of other transfer targets shortlisted. Outgoings wise, Roberto Firmino, Naby Keita, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and James Milner are leaving on free transfers, while there could be defensive casualties in a bid to freshen up Klopp's backline."
Arsenal willing to sell Jorginho & latest on Emile Smith Rowe future,"Jun 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-willing-to-sell-jorginho-latest-on-emile-smith-rowe-future,"Arsenal are willing to listen to offers for midfielder Jorginho this summer, 90min understands. The 31-year-old moved to the Emirates Stadium in January as Mikel Arteta looked to galvanise his squad for an unexpected push towards the Premier League title. Squad depth had been an issue for the Spaniard, who relied heavily on the likes of Thomas Partey, Granit Xhaka and Martin Odegaard in the first five months of the season, and Jorginho's experience of competing at the top level was seen as a welcome boost as Arsenal looked to shake off the relentless Manchester City. Jorginho dislodged Partey from his role as a deep-lying playmaker, making 14 appearances in total, but wasn't able to prevent Arsenal's incredible run of results from tailing off. They eventually finished as runners-up to City but remained comfortably ahead of Manchester United and Newcastle. However, Jorginho's signing was only ever seen as a short-term measure, and 90min understands that Arsenal will not stand in his way this summer should he have the chance to return to Italy. Former Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri, now in charge of Lazio, is keen to reunite with Jorginho at the Stadio Olimpico, and 90min understands that Serie A winners Napoli and Champions League semi-finalists AC Milan are also interested. Arsenal are not actively looking to force Jorginho out of the club but are acutely aware that they need to make space in their squad for incomings. Granit Xhaka is leaving the club to join Bayer Leverkusen and Albert Sambi Lokonga, whose loan spell at Crystal Palace didn't work out, is also likely to be moved on. Their exits could facilitate the arrivals of Declan Rice and Moises Caicedo, with Arsenal keen to sign both players despite their lofty price tags. West Ham captain Rice, who lifted the Europa Conference League on Wednesday night, wants to move on to further his ambitions but 90min understands the club will hold firm with their Â£100m vaulation. Chairman David Sullivan has at least confirmed he'll be leaving. As for Brighton, they may be willing to accept around Â£80m for Caicedo - a figure Arsenal were not prepared to way in the January transfer window. The Gunners may need to pull out all the stops this time round as big-spending Chelsea are interested in signing the pair for new head coach Mauricio Pochettino - they too have players to move on and a wage bill that needs significant trimming. feed Arsenal have no plans to sell attacking midfielder Emile Smith Rowe, 90min further understands, amid speculation over his future in north London. The 22-year-old signed a new five-year contract back in July 2021 and was handed the number ten shirt made famous by Dennis Bergkamp. A firm fans' favourite, he went to enjoy a superb 2021/22 campaign, scoring ten Premier League goals, but struggled to make an impact last season because of a groin injury that required surgery. Smith Rowe was then unable to dislodge Gabriel Martinelli from the starting lineup upon his return, and further competition for places was added when Leandro Trossard arrived from Brighton & Hove Albion in January. But despite playing just 161 minutes of Premier League football, sources have told 90min that Arsenal have no intention of selling and hope Smith Rowe, who was previously the subject of rejected bids from Aston Villa worth at least Â£25m, can recapture his best form next season. The Gunners are also finalising a contract extension for winger Reiss Nelson, who is set to sign a new long-term contract despite concerns of his own around game time."

The 24-year-old was a key target for the Reds this summer as they hoped to bring some fresh blood into their aging midfield, and they have moved quickly to get their man.  Mac Allister underwent a successful medical on Tuesday, with Liverpool keen to tie up a deal for the talented Argentina before he went off on international duty later in the week, and the deal has now been confirmed. ""It feels amazing,"" said Mac Allister after completing his move to Anfield. ""Itâs a dream come true, itâs amazing to be here and I canât wait to get started.

Gerard Pique hits out at Barcelona after missing out on Lionel Messi,"Jun 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/gerard-pique-hits-out-barcelona-missing-lionel-messi,"Gerard Pique has criticised former club Barcelona for financial mismanagement after they missed out on the chance to re-sign Lionel Messi. The Argentine legend was available on a free transfer following the expiration of his contract at Paris Saint-Germain - a club where he spent two inconsistent seasons - and BarÃ§a had been incredibly confident of re-signing him this summer. Messi has instead joined MLS club Inter Miami, admitting in an interview with Mundo Deportivo and SPORT that the financial issues at Barcelona led to his decision. He said: ""I heard it was said La Liga had accepted that everything was fine for me to return, there were still many other things that had to be done.Â I heard that [Barcelona] had to sell players or lower player salaries and the truth is that I didn't want to go through that."" manual Speaking at a Kings League event, Messi's ex-teammate and Barcelona legend Pique lambasted his former club for the financial issues that led to the club missing out on signing the greatest footballer of all time.

They said that we are responsible for our salaries [Pique, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba]."
West Ham chairman confirms Declan Rice wants West Ham exit,"Jun 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-chairman-confirms-declan-rice-west-ham-exit,"West Ham chairman David Sullivan has confirmed that Declan Rice wants to leave the club this summer and expects to part ways with the midfielder in the coming weeks. 90min understands that West Ham are expecting several bids for their star midfielder following their victory in Wednesday's Europa Conference League final over Fiorentina, with a price tag of Â£100m placed on Rice's head. After lifting the trophy, Rice insisted it was 'not goodbye yet' but now Sullivan has confirmed he believes the 24-year-old has played his final game for the club. ""I think it has to be [Rice's final game],"" Sullivan told talkSPORT. ""We promised him he could go. He set his heart on going. You can't ask for a man who has committed more to us this season. ""In due course, he has to get on and we have to get a replacement - or several replacements. feed ""It's not something we want to happen. We offered him Â£200,000-a-week 18 months ago. He turned it down. It's cost him Â£10m to stay at West Ham in that time [in lost wages]. And he wants to go. You can't keep a player who doesn't want to be there."" Sullivan insisted West Ham are yet to receive any bids for Rice but, with their calendar now clear, he believes the bids will start flying in. ""I think the offers will start to come today,"" he continued. ""There are three or four clubs who have shown interest, but out of respect to West Ham, while we're still playing, you don't make offers for players. ""That's not the way decent clubs do things."" 90min understands that Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United are all interested in offering Rice a move across the Premier League, while Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich are also admirers."
Declan Rice makes surprising admission on future after Europa Conference League triumph,"Jun 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/declan-rice-surprising-admission-future-europa-conference-league-triumph,"Declan Rice has assured West Ham United fans he does not currently need to say goodbye as he prepares for another summer of significant uncertainty. Rice has long been admired by Europe's elite and, with one year and a 12-month extension clause left on his contract, is expected to be the subject of some significant bids following Wednesday's Europa Conference League triumph over Fiorentina. 90min understands Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United all hold significant interest in the 24-year-old, while Bayern Munich have also voiced a desire to sign Rice this summer. Asked for an update on his future after ending West Ham's 43-year wait for major silverware, Rice insisted he currently has no reason to think he has played his final match for the Hammers. ""It's not goodbye yet, there's loads of speculation about my future and there is interest from other clubs, but look, nothing's happened,"" he told BT Sport after the game.  feed ""I'm a West Ham player, I've still got two years left on my contract, I love every minute of playing for this club and captaining this club, you can see the smile on my face. It's not about that tonight, it's about us celebrating. Let's wait and see what happens."" West Ham have accepted they are likely to part ways with Rice this summer but are prepared to hold firm on their asking price of Â£100m - seen as a fair price for a player of Rice's age, ability and status as an England international. The pursuit of Rice is expected to accelerate drastically now that West Ham's season is over, with the midfielder previously keeping out of conversations over his future in order to keep his focus on the Europa Conference League final."

How Barcelona failed to re-sign Lionel Messi,"Jun 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/how-barcelona-failed-to-re-sign-lionel-messi,"There are a couple of things FC Barcelona may never be forgiven for by their fans for in the modern era, and both involve Lionel Messi. The club was run into the ground under former president Josep Maria Bartomeu and major financial difficulties that are still hampering them meant Messi was forced to leave Camp Nou in 2021. That was strike one. After a few seasons at Paris Saint-Germain, Messi's contract expired and he headed into the summer of 2023 with a number of options for his next step. A lucrative offer came in from Saudi Arabia while Barcelona talked the talk but failed to put an offer to the 2022 World Cup winner. Despite a lot of public claims from president Joan Laporta and manager Xavi that BarÃ§a wanted Messi to return, they frequently put the ball in his court and his patience eventually waned, opting to move to the United States with Major League Soccer outfit Inter Miami instead. For BarÃ§a fans, that was strike two. But how did the Blaugrana fail to secure the return of their greatest ever player? Barcelona debts were spiralling in 2021 as their on-pitch results got worse and worse. The effects of the Covid-19 pandemic hit them hard, while the increasingly erratic financial handling and decision making of then president Bartomeu made things even worse. Players like Antoine Griezmann and Philippe Coutinho were signed for extraordinary sums all the while Messi's contract approached its expiry. Not enough money could be freed up to register a new deal that was already verbally agreed and Messi's departure was announced in a tearful press conference. PSG was then revealed as his next team, where he'd play alongside Neymar and Kylian Mbappe for two seasons. Messi signed a two-year contract with PSG but never fit fit the mould at Parc des Princes, despite his second season showing improvement after a disappointing first. BarÃ§a officials were never too far away from commenting on his future and the likes of Laporta and Xavi started making more noise about a homecoming in 2023. Laporta claimed Messi would return back in April when asked by Cadena SER and later added he had improved the club's relationship with the star forward. He said in May: ""We will do everything we can to bring Leo Messi back to Barcelona. ""I have spoken with Messi to address the situation. It was very nice. We have recovered our relationship. Messi wants BarÃ§a, he feels this club is his home, but speaking now would do him a disservice."" Xavi added he would find a way to add Messi into his 2022/23 La Liga title winners, but shortly after said the transfer would depend almost entirely on Messi - despite BarÃ§a's infamous financial difficulties. He said: ""Our fans started to mention Leo Messiâs name at every game...I like the feeling. But trust me, the comeback of Leo Messi only depends on him. ""I'd say that it depends 99% on Messi. I have no doubts on football point of view - it's up to Leo."" That ultimatum wasn't enough to drag Messi back to Camp Nou, as Inter Miami won the transfer battle in early June ahead of BarÃ§a and Saudi Arabian team Al-Hilal for his signature. Barcelona couldn't free up enough cash in line with La Liga's financial guidelines, so no formal offer was ever put to Messi despite their previous insistence and optimism that a deal could be struck. The idea of Messi moving to Inter Miami and then joining Barcelona on loan in the future has been mooted. It was an option club co-owner David Beckham used during his playing days, twice signing on loan for AC Milan from LA Galaxy during the MLS off-season."
Barcelona respond to Lionel Messi transfer snub,"Jun 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-respond-lionel-messi-transfer-snub-inter-miami,"Barcelona have issued a statement in response to Camp Nou legend Lionel Messi opting not to return to the club this summer, instead choosing to join MLS side Inter Miami instead. Messi publicly communicated his decision to Miami in an interview with two Barcelona-based newspapers on Wednesday night. In the process of taking his career to a brand new continent, he turned down the advances of his former team. Messi himself admitted that he was really keen to head back to Barcelona, but wasnât prepared for a repeat of the uncertainty that surrounded his 2021 exit. In its statement, the club also appears to have offered a slightly different version of events of what happened. Messi himself suggested that negotiations never got as far as being presented with a formal contract offer by Barcelona, which was part of the reason he looked elsewhere. Barcelona implied his reasons for turning down a return were different. feed âOn Monday, June 5, Jorge Messi, the playerâs father and representative, informed club president Joan Laporta of the player's decision to join Inter Miami, despite having been presented with a proposal from BarÃ§a, in consideration of the desire of both FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi for him to once again wear Blaugrana,â the Barcelona statement read. âPresident Laporta understood and respected Messi's decision to want to compete in a league with fewer demands, further away from the spotlight and the pressure he has been subject to in recent years. Both Joan Laporta and Jorge Messi also agreed to work together to promote a proper tribute from BarÃ§a fans to honor a footballer who has been, is, and always will be beloved by BarÃ§a.â The latter part seems to refer to Messiâs departure to Paris Saint-Germain two years ago coming at a time when he couldnât have a proper send-off, both due to the expectation that he would stay and fans not being able to attend games due to Covid-19 restrictions."
Lionel Messi reveals reason for not choosing Barcelona in transfer decision,"Jun 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/lionel-messi-reveals-reason-not-choosing-barcelona-transfer-decision-inter-miami,"Lionel Messi has admitted that he 'really wanted' to re-join Barcelona from Paris Saint-Germain this summer, but refused to be dragged into a saga in which the decision could have been taken away from him as a result of the clubâs ongoing financial struggles. The only reason Messi left Camp Nou at all in 2021 was because did not have the spending power to register his agreed contract. Now, with his time at PSG at an end two years on, he has chosen Inter Miami for his next chapter because he wasnât convinced that Barcelona wouldnât have the same issue all over again. ""I obviously really wanted to [return],"" Messi explained in a joint interview with Mundo Deportivo and SPORT, during which he revealed his decision to join Inter Miami. ""[I was] very excited to be able to return, but, on the other hand, after having experienced what I experienced and the exit I had [in 2021], I did not want to be in the same situation again: wait to see what would happen and leave my future in someone else's hands, so to speak. ""I wanted to make my own decision, thinking about myself, about my family.Â Although I heard it was said LaLiga had accepted that everything was fine for me to return, there were still many other things that had to be done.Â I heard that [Barcelona] had to sell players or lower player salaries and the truth is that I didn't want to go through that."" Already a 'bit tired', Messi added that La Liga had initially accepted things first time round in 2021 but it still proved to not be possible, which ended up with the player and his family in limbo in a Paris hotel. ""I wanted to make my own decision and that's why it was a bit that I didn't turn to BarÃ§a.Â Although I would have loved it, it couldn't [happen]."" He also explained that it wasn't a question of the money that was offered. feed ""We never even got to talk about the contract,"" he said. ""A proposal was passed over, but never a formal, written, signed proposal, because there was still nothing. There was the intention, but we couldn't advance anything, we didn't even talk about money formally. ""If it had been a matter of money I would have gone to Saudi Arabia or elsewhere.Â It seemed like a lot of money to me and the truth is that my decision was for the other side and not for money."" Barcelona president Joan Laporta had been particularly vocal about re-signing Messi in recent months. But while there were regular conversations with coach and former teammate Xavi, talks with Laporta happened 'once or twice at most'. Asked if he thought Barcelona had done everything possible to bring him back, 35-year-old replied: ""It is their issue. Many things were missing.Â The club, today, was not in a position to confirm 100% that I could return."" The point has already been raised that Messi could yet play for Barcelona again in the way that David Beckham, who is part-owner of Inter Miami, twice joined AC Milan on loan from LA Galaxy during MLS off-seasons. Some kind of ambassadorial role or secretary role was also put to him in the interview."
Luis Suarez set to join Lionel Messi at Inter Miami,"Jun 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/luis-suarez-set-to-join-lionel-messi-inter-miami-mls,"Luis Suarez is set to join Inter Miami alongside former Barcelona teammates Lionel Messi and Sergio Busquets, sources have confirmed to 90min. 90min confirmed on Wednesday that Lionel Messi would be joining Inter Miami this summer, where he would be joined by close friend Sergio Busquets. Now 90min can also confirm that veteran Uruguay star Suarez, who was very close with Messi at Camp Nou, will also be joining the Major League Soccer outfit going through a huge revamp. Messi is arriving on a free transfer after he ran down his contract at Paris Saint-Germain, and likewise Busquets comes in for nothing after leaving Barcelona at the end of the 2022/23 European season. Suarez has been with Brazilian side Gremio since last year following a stint in his homeland with Nacional. The 36-year-old is contracted to Gremio until 2024, but he has a release clause which he and Miami have activated and his signing will soon be confirmed. Suarez's arrival in south Florida will mean he returns to the same squad as Messi and Busquets for the first time since 2020, when he left Camp Nou for Atletico Madrid. "
Lionel Messi announces decision to join Inter Miami,"Jun 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/breaking-lionel-messi-announces-decision-join-inter-miami-mls,"Lionel Messi has announced his decision to join Inter Miami on a free transfer following his Paris Saint-Germain exit, opting for a new challenge instead of re-joining former club Barcelona.  Barca had been confident of re-signing the 35-year-old from Paris Saint-Germain for much of 2023, with Messi's father, Jorge, even stating that his son wanted to return to the club at which he scored a quite astonishing 672 goals in 778 appearances - both club records. Messi had also been offered an eye-watering â¬400m-a-year deal to join Saudi Pro League team Al Hilal this summer - a figure far greater than the amounts being paid to Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, who joined Al Ittihad on Tuesday. But it's Miami and Major League Soccer where Messi will be plying his trade next, with a blockbuster announcement from the player himself in a joint interview with Mundo Deportivo and SPORT confirming he will head to Florida to continue his career. ""I made the decision that I am going to go to Miami,"" Messi said. ""I still haven't closed it one hundred percent. I'm missing some things but we decided to continue the path."" ""I had offers from other European teams but I didn't even evaluate them because my idea was to go to Barcelona. If the Barcelona thing didn't work out, then leaving European football, much more after winning the World Cup, was what I needed. Finishing my career on this side and living the United States league in a different way, enjoying day to day much more but with the same responsibility of wanting to win and always doing things well, but with more peace of mind."" Inter Miami quickly followed up the release of Messi's interview in Spain with a video of their own, poking fun at the reports in recent months sceptical of MLS and linking him with Barcelona or a move to the Saudi Pro League. 90min revealed earlier on Wednesday that MLS and Inter Miami had sensed that there was an opportunity to poach Messi from under the noses of Barcelona, largely due to the financial packaged which involved payments from the league's largest commercial partners in Apple and adidas.  This will be the first time Messi has ever played senior football outside of Europe, having enjoyed 17 years in the Barcelona first-team before leaving for Paris Saint-Germain - where he won Ligue 1 in two consecutive seasons."
Shirt numbers Lionel Messi could wear at Inter Miami,"Jun 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/shirt-numbers-lionel-messi-could-wear-inter-miami,"Major League Soccer has welcomed some huge names throughout its existence - David Beckham, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Steven Gerrard, Andrea Pirlo and David Villa, to name just a few. But Lionel Messi joining Inter Miami is on another level, rivalling when the late, great Pele joined the NASL revolution by signing for New York Cosmos in the 1970s. Messiâs presence in Miami will send the club global and promises to put more eyes on MLS than ever before. His shirt, just like it was at Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain, will immediately be one of the most popular that there is. feed Messi is most famous for his number 10 shirt. He wore the jersey at 13 years for Barcelona, from 2008 following the departure of Ronaldinho until he left the club himself in 2021. Upon joining PSG, the number 10 was already occupied by another superstar, Neymar. Instead, Messi was granted special permission to wear 30, a shirt usually reserved for goalkeepers in France. It was the shirt number that he had first worn when he broke into the Barcelona first-team in 2004. The only other number that Messi has worn in his senior club career to date is 19, which he took at Barcelona in 2005 ahead of his second season. He retained it for three years until switching to 10. Messi has also consistently worn numebr 10 at international level for Argentina since 2008, most notably when he lifted the 2022 World Cup as captain last year. The seven-time Ballon d'Or winner inherited the jersey from Juan Roman Riquelme, having previously worn a mixture of 18 and 19 for his country, as well as number 15 during the 2008 Olympics."
Who will Arsenal sign this summer? Every player linked with the Gunners before the transfer window,"Jun 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/who-will-arsenal-sign-this-summer-every-player-linked-before-transfer-window,"Only an imperious and vintage run from one of the Premier League's all-time great teams prevented Arsenal from lifting their first Premier League title in 19 years. A four-game winless run in April followed by back-to-back defeats in May allowed Manchester City to eventually waltz to their third-straight title after the Gunners had led the way for so long. Nevertheless, victory over Wolves on the final day ensured Mikel Arteta's exuberant outfit finished with their highest points tally since the Invincibles. Arteta's project is on the right track, that's for sure, but the club's stellar campaign will only raise expectations moving forward. Title challenges should become the norm, but only a huge summer transfer window will allow them to compete with City at the top next season. Here are the key positions Arsenal must strengthen ahead of the 2023/24 season and the players they've been linked with thus far. Arsenal's strongest XI doesn't need much bolstering, but the impending exit of Granit Xhaka and Thomas Partey's drop in form means the Gunners are aiming to sign at least two midfielders this summer. One must be capable of operating on the left side of Arteta's midfield three and adept at receiving possession between the lines in a more advanced role. The other, meanwhile, must take on the demanding holding midfield function. Although, Arteta took steps to ease the burden on his number six in possession by utilising Oleksandr Zinchenko as an inverted full-back.  Arsenal will then look to strengthen their depth chart both out wide and in defence. Greater competition for Bukayo Saka is required, as is superior depth behind William Saliba. The Gunners could sign a right-back which would allow either Ben White or Takehiro Tomiyasu to play centrally when required, or sign an outright backup for Saliba. A new left-back will also be needed should Kieran Tierney be sold. Nuno Tavares is unlikely to be on the club's books next season. Arsenal's priority midfield target is Declan Rice and the club will make a move for the England international after he leads West Ham out in the Europa Conference League final against Fiorentina. However, the Gunners face stiff competition from the likes of Manchester United, Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Man City for his signature, according to 90min. Moises Caicedo is also high on Arsenal's list of midfield targets, with 90min reporting Brighton are ready to listen to offers for the Ecuadorian. The Seagulls recently parted with Alexis Mac Allister for a meagre Â£35m and they're unlikely to be so generous when it comes to Caicedo. The Gunners are also keen on signing Man City pair Ilkay Gundogan and Joao Cancelo. Gundogan, who's a free agent this summer, has several options at his disposal and could yet extend his contract with the Cityzens. Cancelo, who spent the second half of the season on loan at Bayern, will return to City and 90min understands Arsenal along with Bayern and Barcelona are keen on signing the versatile full-back.  City, however, will not want to sell to the Gunners after letting Gabriel Jesus and Zinchenko fall into their lap last summer. A surprise name to keep an eye on in the coming weeks is former Barcelona flop Malcom. The Brazilian enjoyed a remarkable season with Zenit and has attracted plenty of interest from top European clubs. 90min believe Arsenal are one of the teams keen on signing the winger. feed With Aaron Ramsdale signing a new long-term extension and Matt Turner proving his worth as a number two, Arsenal are unlikely to make any alterations to their goalkeeper depth chart this summer.  Player Position Team Potential fee Marc Guehi CB Crystal Palace Â£40m Ivan Fresneda RB Real Valladolid Â£17.5m Sacha Boey RB Galatasaray Â£22m Joao Cancelo RB/LB Man City Â£40m Fikayo Tomori CB Milan Â£55m Player Position Team Potential fee Declan Rice DM/CM West Ham Â£110m Moises Caicedo DM/CM Brighton Â£90m Mason Mount AM/CM Chelsea Â£50m Youri Tielemans CM Leicester Free Ilkay Gundogan CM/DM Man City Free Xavi Simons AM PSV Â£35m Player Position Team Potential fee Moussa Diaby RW Bayer Leverkusen Â£70m Marcos Leonardo ST Santos Â£25m Dusan Vlahovic ST Juventus Â£70m Raphinha RW Barcelona Â£85m Ferran Torres RW/CF Barcelona Â£40m Malcom RW Zenit Â£35m"
Real Madrid reach agreement with Borussia Dortmund over Jude Bellingham,"Jun 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/real-madrid-reach-agreement-borussia-dortmund-jude-bellingham,"Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund have reached an agreement for the transfer of Jude Bellingham, who is now undergoing a medical in the Spanish capital. 90min confirmed last month the deal between the two sides was close and an agreement is now in place. Real have agreed to pay an initial â¬100m plus adds-ons which could amount to 30% of that fee - sources have told 90min that Dortmund are 'very happy' with the agreement reached between the two parties which will make Bellingham the fourth most expensive player of all time. Bellingham is already in Madrid to undergo medical tests, allowing the England star to continue rehab on a knee issue which hampered the end to his season with Dortmund. The injury looks set to rule him out of the Three Lions' forthcoming Euro 2024 qualifiers against Malta and North Macedonia despite being included in Gareth Southgate's squad. manual The agreement between Real and Dortmund comes after contract terms were finalised with Bellingham at the beginning of May. The transfer is also welcome news for Bellingham's former club Birmingham, who are due around 5% of the deal."
Who will Man Utd sign this summer? Every player linked with the Red Devils before the transfer window,"Jun 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/who-will-man-utd-sign-this-summer-every-player-linked-before-transfer-window,"After succumbing to a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Brentford on the second weekend of the season, very few would have foreshadowed Manchester United's eventual success in 2022/23. While the campaign ended on a bitter note as they fell to defeat in the FA Cup final to treble-chasers and crosstown rivals Manchester City, Erik ten Hag had already secured the club a piece of silverware and a swift return to the Champions League in his first season at the helm. However, the great Man Utd aspire to be much more than merely in their noisy neighbours' shadow. This term was undoubtedly an excellent starting point, but the Red Devils have a long way to go until they're competing with Pep Guardiola's Cityzens for the highest honours. A big summer beckons at Old Trafford with Ten Hag stressing the need for a busy window before his side's defeat at Wembley. Here's an overview of the key positions United need to strengthen and the players they've been linked with heading into the summer transfer window. You might argue that United need to strengthen across the board if they're to make a big leap in 2023/24. However, in terms of key positions of need, the two that standout are goalkeeper and striker.  Sure, David de Gea may have ended the season with the Premier League's Golden Glove, but nobody would have said he was the best goalkeeper in the division. Errors continue to undermine his game and his sub-par work in possession means he's certainly vulnerable to losing his place next season to a shot-stopper more competent with the ball at his feet. De Gea's contract expires this summer, but the Spaniard is likely to pen a new deal. At the other end of the pitch, United essentially operated without an outright number nine for much of the season. With Anthony Martial often injured and Wout Weghorst proving an ineffectual addition, the goalscoring burden fell on the shoulders of Marcus Rashford, who performs better when darting in off the left. The Red Devils have a long list of striker targets this summer, and it's imperative that they snag one of their favoured options.  In terms of other priorities, it looks as if Man Utd will target a defender with the likes of Harry Maguire and Aaron Wan-Bissaka departing, while another midfielder, one capable of performing multiple functions, could be added to the club's arsenal with Marcel Sabitzer unlikely to continue at Old Trafford.  feed United typically play a leading role in the transfer market, and rumour mills love to link the club with a whole host of players from across the continent.  90min, meanwhile, understand the Red Devils have already agreed personal terms with Mason Mount over a summer move and they could look to team him up with longtime pal and England teammate Declan Rice, who has drawn interest from the Premier League's leading clubs as well as Bayern Munich. Porto shot-stopper Diogo Costa is currently the leading target to potentially usurp De Gea between the sticks. In terms of their striker pursuit, 90min understands Harry Kane, Randal Kolo Muani, Victor Osimhen, Rasmus Hojlund, and Dusan Vlahovic are all on United's radar. The club want to add two strikers to their ranks this summer - one young and the other established - but Karim Benzema's Real Madrid exit could compromise their pursuit of Kane. Vlahovic has told Juventus he wants to leave the club, while Atalanta want upwards of Â£50m for Hojlund's services.  Benjamin Pavard has told Bayern Munich of his desire to leave this summer, with 90min recently reporting that Man Utd have opened talks with the player's representatives. The Frenchman would prove to be a cheaper alternative to the club's alternate targets, such as Ajax's Jurrien Timber and Napoli's Kim Min-jae.  Player Position Team Potential fee Diogo Costa GK Porto Â£65m David Raya GK Brentford Â£40m Emiliano Martinez GK Aston Villa Â£30m Player Position Team Potential fee Jurrien Timber RB/CB Ajax Â£45m Jules Kounde RB/CB Barcelona Â£70m Benjamin Pavard  RB/CB Bayern Munich Â£25m Kim Min-jae CB Napoli Â£55m Player Position Team Potential fee Mason Mount AM/CM Chelsea Â£50m Sofyan Amrabat DM Fiorentina Â£20m Declan Rice DM/CM West Ham Â£110m Adrien Rabiot CM Juventus Free Mohammed Kudus AM Ajax Â£45m Player Position Team Potential fee Harry Kane ST Tottenham Â£100m Victor Osimhen ST Napoli Â£95m Dusan Vlahovic ST Juventus Â£70m Rasmus Hojlund ST Atalanta Â£52m Randal Kolo-Muani ST Eintracht Frankfurt Â£85m Neymar LW/AM Paris Saint-Germain Â£60m"
Brighton prepare club-record bid for Chelsea's Levi Colwill,"Jun 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/brighton-prepare-club-record-bid-chelsea-levi-colwill,"Brighton and Hove Albion are preparing a club-record Â£40m bid to sign talented centre-back Levi Colwill this summer, 90min understands. The 20-year-old centre-back was a regular under Roberto De Zerbi during his loan spell at Brighton during the 2022/23 Premier League season, becoming one of the most highly-regarded young defenders in Europe through his impressive showings. feed Following the expiration of his loan deal, Brighton have been keen to re-sign Colwill on a permanent basis. 90min understands they are now willing to make a bid in excess of Â£40m to sign the defender. If that bid doesn't entice the Blues, Brighton have also told Chelsea they'd be willing to consider offering midfielder Moises Caicedo in part-exchange for Colwill. Manager De Zerbi all but confirmed Caicedo is set to leave the club this summer after his side's final game of the season, with Chelsea, Man Utd, Arsenal and Man City all retaining an interest. 90min recently reported Brighton are willing to listen to offers for their star midfielder. Despite the Seagulls' strong interest in Colwill, Chelsea currently consider the defender 'unsellable' and are keen to see how he performs in pre-season. The player himself has told the Blues he wants to leave if he is not part of the the first-team, but the club has ensured him he is indeed part of Mauricio Pochettino's first-team plans heading into the 2023/24 season."
Man City preparing to make move for Real Madrid target Josko Gvardiol,"Jun 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-city-preparing-make-move-real-madrid-target-josko-gvardiol,"Manchester City are poised to firm up their interest in RB Leipzig defender Josko Gvardiol this summer and make a move for the Croatia international, sources have told 90min. Gvardiol has emerged in recent months as one of the most highly-rated defenders in football following on from his performances at the 2022 World Cup. The left-footed centre-backÂ was close to joining Chelsea last summer, but the Blues failed to secure a deal with Leipzig. Chelsea do still hold an interest, yet without any European competition to offer 2023/24, they have little hope of persuading the player to move to Stamford Bridge. Gvardiol has a clause in his contract worth just shy of Â£100m that is due to kick in from 2024. But, as 90min revealed earlier this year, Leipzig are ready to take less than the figure to facilitate a move. feed Gvardiol himself knows he will virtually have his pick of clubs when he decides to leave and 90min understands that, as it stands, his preferred options are Manchester City and Real Madrid. City will make room in their squad with the sale of Spain international Aymeric Laporte, who has made it known he is ready to move and amid interest from clubs including Aston Villa and Tottenham. It remains to be seen if Real Madrid will push to do a deal this summer. Like City, Los Blancos are huge fans of Gvardiol and have been following him closely, but they have other needs and it is believed they want a new left-back ahead of a left-sided centre-back at this time."
N'Golo Kante close to joining Karim Benzema at Al Ittihad,"Jun 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/n-golo-kante-close-to-joining-karim-benzema-al-ittihad,"Chelsea midfielder N'Golo Kante is poised to join Karim Benzema at Al Ittihad on a lucrative two-year deal, 90min understands. The 32-year-old is out of contract at Stamford Bridge this summer and has been in lengthy talks over an extension. There had been confidence in west London that Kante would ink fresh terms and prolong his stay at the club, despite interest from Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain. But 90min reported on Friday that Kante, who has struggled with numerous injury problems and was restricted to just seven Premier League appearances last season, had received an approach from the Middle East and was prepared to engage in talks to see what was on offer in Saudi Arabia. A meeting is understood to have taken place in London between Kante's representatives and a PIF delegation from Saudi Arabia, with an agreement now close on a blockbuster two-year contract that will see the Frenchman earn slightly less than his international teammate Benzema, who joined Al Ittihad on a three-year deal on Tuesday. 90min understands that the finishing touches are now being applied to the deal, which will end Kante's impressive eight-season stay in the Premier League. feed Regarded as one of the finest central midfielders of the modern era, Kante played a significant role in helping Leicester City achieve in the impossible in 2015/16, when they won the Premier League title, before replicating that success at Chelsea 12 months later. Kante also played significant roles in Chelsea's Europa League and Champions League successes in 2018/19 and 2020/21, while he has appeared in nine other cup finals for the club. His impending departure could be the first step of a dramatic makeover of Chelsea's bloated squad. New head coach Mauricio Pochettino has a number of decisions to make in terms of key personnel and 90min understands that Kante may not be the only departure from central midfield. Mateo Kovacic looks to be heading for the exit door, potentially to champions Manchester City, while Mason Mount's future at the club is uncertain amid interest from a number of Premier League rivals. The 24-year-old has agreed personal terms with Manchester United, though he could still remain in west London should Pochettino determine he's part of his long-term plans."
MLS & Inter Miami working on signing Lionel Messi ahead of Barcelona,"Jun 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/mls-inter-miami-working-on-signing-lionel-messi-ahead-of-barcelona,"Major League Soccer and Inter Miami remain confident they can beat Barcelona to the signing of Lionel Messi, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 35-year-old's departure from Paris Saint-Germain has been a long time coming, with many expecting a fairytale return to Barcelona to materialise despite the Catalan giants' ongoing financial difficulties. Messi's father, Jorge, has been in regular dialogue with president Joan Laporta over a return to Camp Nou and it's no secret that it's his preferred destination. Whether or not Barcelona are in a position to re-sign Messi remains to be seen, despite La Liga approving their financial viability plan. 90min understands that registering Gavi's new contract was the club's first order of business, while Ronald Araujo and Alejandro Balde's improved deals still need to be officially ratified. Multiple sources have confirmed to 90min that MLS and Inter Miami sense an opportunity to steal in and poach Messi, and there's increasing optimism that a deal can be agreed to take the star of last year's World Cup stateside. The package offered to Messi is expected to involve payments from MLS' two largest commercial partners, Apple and adidas - both of whom have the financial muscle to help match the potential earnings of a move back to Barcelona. There's even a possibility that Messi could join Inter Miami before heading back to Barcelona on loan - that would be one way of the Argentine having one last crack at winning the Champions League under Xavi before focusing on MLS for the final years of his career. manual Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal have also put a gargantuan offer on the table for Messi, which 90min revealed in May was understood to be worth more than â¬400m-a-year - significantly more than what Cristiano Ronaldo is earning at Al Nassr. There's no indication at this stage that Messi is looking to accept that offer, but the longer Barcelona have to drag their heels and iron out their financial plans, the more chance there is of the Argentine growing impatient. Were Messi to head to Saudi Arabia, he would join Karim Benzema as a marquee arrival in the Middle East - the Frenchman recently penned a three-year deal to join champions Al Ittihad from Real Madrid. N'Golo Kante and Wilfried Zaha are two other players closing in on a move to Saudi Arabia, with their respective Premier League careers appearing to be coming to an end after receiving huge contract proposals, and a raft of other huge names have been tipped to join Benzema in the not too distant future."

Real Madrid back away from Kai Havertz deal after learning Chelsea asking price,"Jun 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/real-madrid-kai-havertz-chelsea-asking-price,"Real Madrid have cooled their pursuit of Kai Havertz amid concerns over Chelsea's asking price, 90min understands. The Spanish side have spoken with Havertz's representatives and have made it clear that they would be interested in a summer deal, with manager Carlo Ancelotti seeing the 23-year-old as the kind of versatile forward that could replace the departing duo of Eden Hazard and Marco Asensio. Chelsea are keen to keep Havertz this summer but 90min understands they would sell for the right price, such is their need to raise money after 12 months of immense spending failed to result in Champions League football. The Blues are believed to be keen to recoup the money they spent to sign Havertz in 2020, in excess of Â£70m, and sources have confirmed that Real Madrid have backed away from the negotiating table as things stand. Real Madrid officials do not share the same value of Havertz, who has two years remaining on his contract, and are not currently prepared to pursue a deal at that price. feed Despite the breakdown in negotiations, Havertz still has a real chance of leaving Chelsea this summer. Bayern Munich, led by former Blues boss Thomas Tuchel, are long-term admirers of the German and see him as a possible replacement for the ageing Thomas Muller. Paris Saint-Germain have also been alerted to Havertz's potential availability as they look to replace Lionel Messi. Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino has made it clear that Havertz still has a place in his team but, with Christopher Nkunku arriving this summer and plans in place to sign a new central striker, the Argentine is ready to sanction his departure. Real Madrid chased Havertz's signature back in 2020 before he ultimately opted for Chelsea and the German forward still has plenty of fans at the Santiago Bernabeu. Indeed, they may go back in for Havertz depending on how their pursuit of Tottenham striker Harry Kane works out - he has just one-year left on his contract and has been identified as Karim Benzema's potential successor."

Aston Villa interested in Pau Torres and Aymeric Laporte ,"Jun 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/aston-villa-interested-pau-torres-aymeric-laporte,"Aston Villa have held talks over potential deals to sign Spanish defenders Pau Torres and Aymeric Laporte this summer, 90min understands.  The Villans enjoyed a hugely successful 2022/23 campaign under new manager Unai Emery, securing a place in next season's UEFA Europa Conference League. With European football secured and strong financial backing behind them, Villa have ambitious plans in the works for this summer's transfer window.

Nottingham Forest in talks over permanent Dean Henderson transfer,"Jun 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/nottingham-forest-in-talks-permanent-dean-henderson-transfer,"Nottingham Forest are in talks with Manchester United over a potential permanent transfer for goalkeeper Dean Henderson, 90min understands. Henderson spent the 2022/23 campaign on loan with Forest, which saw the club survive in the Premier League in their first top flight season for 23 years. The 26-year-old had previously earned a reputation as a top Premier League goalkeeper during time on loan with Sheffield United. But he was unable to displace David de Gea at Old Trafford when that spell came to an end, despite signing a bumper long-term contract in 2020. Henderson was a regular starter for Forest in the first half of his loan at the City Ground, only for a thigh injury in January to rule him out for several months. At that point, the club drafted in three-time Champions League winner Keylor Navas for the rest of the season. 90min understands that Forest had been waiting to see whether re-signing Navas would be viable. But the 36-year-old Costa Rican is set to have numerous offers to choose from amid interest from clubs in Europe, the Middle East, MLS and South America. feed Henderson has equally been waiting on the Navas situation as it is important to him to be a regular starter, rather than risk being a back-up. 90min understands that while talks between the clubs are not at an advanced stage, contact has been made and conversations are happening. Cumbria-born Henderson was 14 when he recruited by Manchester United after four years in the youth ranks at local club Carlisle. His first taste of senior football came during a loan with Stockport County shortly before turning 19, with further loans at Grimsby and Shrewsbury to follow. But it was when the goalkeeper was loaned to Sheffield United in the summer of 2018, still only 21 at the time, that his real opportunity came. Over two seasons, Henderson was a key part of the Blades team that earned promotion to the Premier League and then finished ninth in the top flight. Henderson returned to Manchester and played 26 times for his parent club across all competitions during the 2020/21 season, including an extended run ahead of De Gea in the Premier League. But he couldn't make it stick and fell almost completely out of favour in 2021/22."

Havertz will enter the final two years of his contract this summer and Chelsea, who are reluctant to see any player arrive at such a point in their deal, have made it clear that he does still have a future at the club. However, 90min understands that Chelsea officials are well aware of the need to sell players to raise money this summer and Havertz, who is among the club's highest earners, could well be sold if he indicates a desire to leave the club. feed New Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino, while being open to working with Havertz, is prepared to sanction the 23-year-old's departure if the right deal arises, and there are plenty of interested sides across Europe. As revealed in March, Bayern Munich are keen to land Havertz, but Real Madrid have also held conversations with the German's representatives in the past week and are understood to hold a significant interest in luring him to the Santiago Bernabeu. 90min understands that Paris Saint-Germain have also been alerted to the possibility of a summer exit for Havertz, whose chances of leaving Chelsea are growing with the mounting interest in his services. Havertz has made 139 appearances for Chelsea since joining in the summer of 2020, lining up largely as the team's central striker, but the Blues are looking for reinforcements in that position this summer and have identified Napoli's Victor Osimhen as their dream signing. Attacking midfielder Christopher Nkunku has already agreed to join from RB Leipzig this summer, which will give Chelsea another option in attack."
Sergio Busquets confirms plans after Barcelona exit,"Jun 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/sergio-busquets-confirms-plans-after-barcelona-exit,"Sergio Busquets has revealed that he is keen to play for a team outside of Europe after leaving Barcelona. The legendary defensive midfielder left Barcelona following the conclusion of the 2022/23 season, bringing an end to a storied 15-year senior career at the club. In that time Busquets won three UEFA Champions Leagues, nine La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey, three FIFA Club World Cups and also racked up the third most appearances in the club's history.  Speaking to The Guardian after his Barcelona exit, Busquets admitted that he does not want to play for another European club because he would not want to play against his boyhood club.  ""I still don't have plans, honestly. I do have three or four options but nothing is done. I donât want to play for any European team: it would be hard to face Barcelona with anything serious in play, and I want to live a calmer, more relaxed experience,"" he explained. ""I would like things to get sorted quickly over the next two or three weeks.  feed ""The decision will be mine and my family's, just ours. All of us have decisions to make now and maybe we will coincide, but thereâs no plan."" 90min reported back in March that MLS club Inter Miami were determined to sign Busquets at the end of his contract, having already sent an initial offer to the player's representatives.  The former Spain international also admitted that he intends to do his coaching badges with a view to becoming a manager in the future. ""I would like to get my licence and prepare myself for it,"" he said. ""I have an idea. The difficult part is managing a dressing room with 25 players, all with their egos. I'm interested to see if I can communicate with them, and convince them of what I want."""
Karim Benzema agrees Al-Ittihad contract,"Jun 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/karim-benzema-agrees-al-ittihad-contract,"Karim Benzema has agreed a three-year contract with Saudi Pro League club Al-Ittihad, 90min understands. Benzema called time on his Real Madrid career earlier this month, bringing an end to his 14-year association with Los Blancos and going out in suitable fashion with a goal in the 1-1 draw with Athletic Club to close out the 2022/23 La Liga season. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Benzema is now set to take his talents to Saudi Arabia, where Al-Ittihad have agreed the terms of a three-year deal with the veteran striker. Real Madrid will host a farewell event for Benzema on Tuesday, after which the 35-year-old's move to Al-Ittihad is expected to be announced. Benzema will head to the Middle East to do battle with former Real teammate Cristiano Ronaldo, whose Al-Nassr side finished five points behind champions Al-Ittihad in the Saudi Pro League title race last season. feed Al-Ittihad are currently managed by former Wolves and Tottenham manager Nuno Espirito Santo, who signed a two-year contract when he joined in the summer of 2022. Leading the line for Al-Ittihad last season was Morocco international Abderrazak Hamdallah, who finished as the division's top scorer with 21 goals in 26 games, but Benzema appears set to take his place in the team. Benzema's move to Saudi Arabia comes amid a huge push from Saudi officials to drive more big names to the Middle East.  90min reported recently that Chelsea's N'Golo Kante has been approached over a move to Saudi Arabia when his contract expires next month, while plenty of other high-profile players are being targeted for lucrative moves. Lionel Messi, who has departed Paris Saint-Germain, has an enormous offer on the table from Al-Hilal to become the highest-paid player on the planet."
The Celtic players Ange Postecoglou could take to Tottenham,"Jun 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/the-celtic-players-ange-postecoglou-could-take-to-tottenham,"Ange Postecoglou is now officially the latest man to take on the Tottenham job. After Arne Slot seemingly used the club's interest as leverage in contract negotiations with Feyenoord, Tottenham threatened to endure another torturous managerial search as was the case in 2021.  Spurs' search two summers ago was nothing short of a joke, and while some supporters aren't best pleased with the route they've gone down this time around, at least they've got their new boss in before the summer transfer window opens for business.  While a very likeable bloke and potentially the facilitator of a brand of football Spurs supporters desire, there's no denying the risks with appointing Postecoglou given the sheer enormity of the task that awaits the 57-year-old Australian.  Time and patience is necessary among the fanbase with a difficult road ahead, and Postecoglou may seek familiarity in a bid to ease his transition into the Premier League. Here are four Celtic players he could bring with him to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this summer.  feed Ange has been wedded to a 4-3-3 since he joined Yokohama F. Marinos in 2018, and we should expect the Australian to adopt a similar system in north London.However, with Rodrigo Bentancur recovering from an ACL tear, there are currently few midfielders within the Spurs squad capable of excelling as a box-to-box number eight. You might argue that the two best suited to the roles, Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso, are destined to be moved on this summer. There are alternate options, such as Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Pape Matar Sarr, but Postecoglou might try and reunite with converted forward Hatate, who was arguably the most impressive performer in the Scottish top flight during the Australian's two years at Celtic Park.  With Lucas Moura moving on and Bryan Gil's future uncertain, Spurs require depth in wide areas - even more so if Harry Kane departs and Richarlison is tasked with replacing him up top.Thus, a possible familiar option for Postecoglou is Jota, who dazzled during the big man's two years at Celtic. The Benfica academy graduate has notched 41 Scottish Premiership goal contributions in 62 appearances. The 24-year-old is adept off both flanks and perhaps ready for a step up in standard after standing out in Scotland. His playmaking capacity is equally impressive as his goalscoring, and a move to Spurs would allow him to reunite with the boss that got the very best out of him. The club's current options mean Jota wouldn't be expected to claim a starting role right away either.  "
Sergio Ramos urges Harry Kane to choose Real Madrid over Man Utd,"Jun 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/sergio-ramos-harry-kane-choose-real-madrid-over-man-utd,"Real Madrid legend Sergio Ramos has urged Harry Kane to choose Los Blancos over Manchester United should he depart Tottenham in the coming months. Kane is about to enter the final year of the long-term Spurs contract he signed back in 2018. There is yet to be an agreement over a new deal, but 90min revealed in April that both Kane and the club have been willing to wait until a new head coach is appointed. After failing to convince Julian Nagelsmann and Arne Slot, that now looks set to be Ange Postecoglou after he agreed to take it. Manchester United are seeking a new first choice ânumber nineâ, with Kane among a list of options the club is considering alongside Dusan Vlahovic, Victor Osimhen and Benjamin Sesko. Bayern Munich have backed away from their longstanding Kane interest in favour or pursuing Randal Kolo Muani, despite his â¬100m price tag, while Paris Saint-Germain are ready to enter the race, and Spurs are also expecting interest to surface from London rivals Chelsea. As 90min reported in February, Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is determined not to let Kane join another Premier League club. feed Real Madrid have come on the scene following Karim Benzemaâs decision to leave the Bernabeu after 14 years for a new challenge in Saudi Arabia with Al-Ittihad. Los Blancos are now ready to step up their interest, with Kane the preferred replacement in the eyes of Carlo Ancelotti. Other options in Madrid include the aforementioned Osimhen, as well as Kai Havertz and Joselu. Ramos, who spent 16 years at Real and infamously resisted the chance to join Manchester United in 2015, has warned Kane against rebuffing the chance to join Real. ""My advice to any player is don't turn down the opportunity to play forÂ Real Madrid â it is a special club who know how to win,"" the centre-back explained. ""[Kane] has an incredible physical presence, you can't score as many goals as he does in theÂ Premier LeagueÂ and not be able to play the physical side of the game. But he can also play the technical side of the game as well and I don't think he gets enough credit for that. ""Yes, he is a great goal scorer but he is also a great football player as well."""

As 90min revealed late last month, talks have been held with the representatives of both Borussia Monchengladbach's Manu Kone and Nice's Khephren Thuram, who have also attracted interest from most of Europe's elite. Bayern Munich's Ryan Gravenberch, Wolves' Ruben Neves and impending free agent Youri Tielemans are all admired at Anfield, while Liverpool have also discussed a possible move for Leeds' Tyler Adams following the Yorkshire outfit's relegation from the Premier League."

After that meeting, Jorge confirmed that Messi wants to return to Barcelona and there is optimism that a deal can be done, but the 35-year-old has also been offered an eye-watering contract in Saudi Arabia that would make him the highest-earning player on the planet.

""The decision will be known this Tuesday or Wednesday,"" Jorge confirmed. feed Jorge later admitted that 'it is difficult' to say where Messi would be playing next season and stressed that a return to Barcelona hinges solely on whether the La Liga champions can actually afford to offer him a contract. Barcelona have exceeded their salary cap and have been banned from adding any extra salary by La Liga, who have received a viability plan from the Blaugrana in an attempt to gain permission to make moves this summer. 90min understands that their transfer wishes are expected to be given the green light imminently but Barcelona do have plenty of other business to attend to. Registering the contracts of Gavi and Ronald Araujo, whose senior extensions are still technically not official, remains a high priority as well. Once a final decision on Messi's future has been made, Barcelona also plan to recruit centre-back Inigo Martinez, who will leave Athletic Club as a free agent this summer, and they also want to sign Manchester City captain Ilkay Gundogan on a free transfer."

Erling Haaland contract: Man City pushing to remove clauses & agree new deal,"Jun 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/erling-haaland-contract-man-city-clauses-new-deal,"Manchester City remain keen on persuading Erling Haaland to agree a new contract at the club this summer, 90min understands. The 22-year-old arrived at the Etihad Stadium last summer in a bargain deal worth just over Â£50m, thanks to a release clause in his contract at Borussia Dortmund. Haaland has more than paid back the fee with a series of stunning performances during his debut campaign, and has registered an incredible 52 goals in all competitions at a rate of one goal per game. 36 of those goals came in City's successful Premier League title defence - a record for most goals scored in a single season - en route to collecting the Golden Boot, Player of the Season and Young Player of the Season awards. As well scooping those individual accolades, Haaland has helped City to the brink of a famous treble - Saturday's UEFA Champions League final against Inter on Saturday the missing piece of the jigsaw after the FA Cup final win over Manchester United last weekend. 90min revealed in March that City were keen to reward Haaland with a new contract, not only to reward his outstanding performances but also to remove a number of clauses that were inserted into the deal - with one in particular believed to stipulate that the Norwegian can leave should a certain figure be offered to City. Not all of the clauses in Haaland's contract are active - there's one that is believed to involve the future of Pep Guardiola as manager - but 90min understands that City remain keen on negotiating a new deal to prevent them becoming live in the future. The player's representatives, however, do not see the need to remove them at this time. Indeed, Haaland's agent, Rafaela Pimenta, explained to Spanish publication AS last year why the clauses are crucial to her client's contract. manual âWhen a player goes to a club, I do all I can to create a situation where the key is in their hands,"" Pimenta said. ""If tomorrow you donât want to be there anymore because you donât like it, or if they donât pay you well, or if your wide wants to live in Paris, well, you go, no? I donât like it when the player has no freedom to decide. I have done all the contracts in this agency in 25 years. All of them. There wasnât a single time when a player said âI want to goâ and they could not do it. âFor me,Â HaalandÂ is worth a billion, no one is going to pay that, but itâs the potential that he has when he arrives at a club. He brings with him fans, goals, results, professionalism, digital content, notoriety, sponsors...if you put all that together, his value includes a lot of things. âBut the price of a footballer, in reality, is set by a club. I know that no one is going to pay 700m for one player, but itâs very clear that Erlingâs value when he arrives at a club is immense, itâs at least a billion.â Pimenta added to the mystery of a potential release clause in a recent interview with Mundo Deportivo and has previously spoken about a move to Real Madrid amid links to the Santiago Bernabeu. The Spaniards are unexpectedly searching for a new centre forward after Karim Benzema opted to end his 14-year stay in the Spanish capital in favour of a move to Saudi Arabia, and Haaland is a known long-term target for the club alongside Kylian Mbappe and Harry Kane. Kane is expected to be the striker Real make a move for now, with Haaland's future at City likely secure in the short-term given the success of his first season in Manchester."

Paez is widely seen as one of the most exciting prospects in South America and recently impressed at the Under-20 World Cup, racking up one goal and three assists in Ecuador's four games in the competition. Before heading off on international duty, Paez agreed a huge move to Chelsea which 90min understands could be worth up to â¬20m if all bonuses are met - a clear record for a player of his age - and the Blues have now confirmed the move.

West Ham braced for opening bids for Declan Rice,"Jun 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-braced-for-opening-bids-for-declan-rice,"West Ham anticipate receiving bids for captain Declan Rice in the immediate aftermath of the Europa Conference League final with Fiorentina. The Hammers will appear in their first major European final for 47 years on Wednesday looking to win their first trophy of any kind since 1980, when they surprisingly beat Arsenal 1-0, as a second division side, to lift the FA Cup at Wembley. David Moyes' side were disappointing in the Premier League during 2022/23, losing 20 of their 38 games to finish 14th in the table, but have been excellent in Europe, overcoming Gent and AZ Alkmaar in the knockout stages of the Conference League to book their place in Prague. Central to their run to the final has been Rice, whose long-term future has dominated the build-up to the game. Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United all hold significant interest in the 24-year-old, as do Bayern Munich - Bundesliga champions for the last 11 seasons. West Ham have accepted that Rice, who has two years remaining on his contract, is likely to leave London Stadium this summer and have been preparing for his eventual departure for some time.

Rice has publicly stated his ambition to play in the Champions League and compete for trophies, and it's unlikely that a West Ham win against Fiorentina - which would book a place in next season's Europa League - will be enough to keep him at the club. And though money is not a factor in Rice's decision making, it's clear that his growing stature and reputation - one that has been enhanced by the interest of so many clubs - could command a significant wage packet that West Ham simply aren't able to afford. As it stands, Rice has not made it clear if he has a preferred destination, despite talk of the player wanting to remain in London to be . Furthermore, he is leaving talks over his future to his family and representatives while he focuses on leading West Ham out against Fiorentina."

Xavi expecting 'key week' for Barcelona transfer strategy,"Jun 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/xavi-expecting-key-week-barcelona-transfer-strategy-summer-2023,"Barcelona manager Xavi is expecting the club to make significant moves behind the scenes 'this week' as they look to finalise their plan for the summer transfer window. The Spanish champions have submitted plans, including for the possible re-signing of Camp Nou legend Lionel Messi, to La Liga and are awaiting approval. 90min understands a final decision from league officials is expected imminently. Currently, Barcelona have been banned from registering new players after exceeding their salary cap but a 'viability plan' has been put to La Liga in the hope of proving their ability to get spending back under control - a cause which has been aided by the departures of Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba. Xavi is expecting some positive moves in the coming days and, after Sunday's surprise defeat to Celta Vigo to finish the season, confirmed the club will finalise their plans soon. ""We have had a great season. We have to reinforce ourselves to fight for all the titles and compete especially in Europe. There we must take a step forward and we need two players per position.

The definitive step to be competitive in all the titles is to strengthen yourself well.""

""I donât know if it was the last game for some players, it will depend this week, which will be decisive,"" he continued. ""We are on âstandbyâ, but it will be a key week to find out what stage we are in."""
PSG finalising Manuel Ugarte transfer as Chelsea back away from deal,"Jun 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-finalising-manuel-ugarte-transfer-chelsea-back-away,"Paris Saint-Germain are closing in on the signing of Sporting CP midfielder Manuel Ugarte, 90min understands, after Chelsea pulled back from a move for the 22-year-old. PSG agreed personal terms with Ugarte last month after making the Uruguay international one of their primary transfer targets, but saw their move complicated by rival interest from the big-spending Blues. Chelsea, who are looking to strengthen their options in central midfield, put forward a healthy offer to Sporting in the hope of luring Ugarte to Stamford Bridge, but their efforts were met with resistance from the player and his representatives, who pushed to complete a move to the French capital. Sources have now confirmed to 90min that Chelsea backed away from the deal and PSG are now finalising the details of Ugarte's proposed transfer, which will reward the player with significantly higher wages than those on offer in west London. New Chelsea head coach Mauricio Pochettino has a number of other shortlisted players to choose from, with Brighton's Moises Caicedo and West Ham's Declan Rice seen as preferred targets at this stage. feed Monaco's Youssouf Fofana, PSV Eindhoven's Ibrahim Sangare and Southampton's Romeo Lavia are also appreciated by Chelsea officials, as is Ajax's Edson Alvarez, although the latter is expected to join Borussia Dortmund. Midfield is key focus for Chelsea this summer as the Blues prepare to bid farewell to Mateo Kovacic and Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who are being targeted by Manchester City and AC Milan, respectively. There is also uncertainty over the futures of Mason Mount and Conor Gallagher. N'Golo Kante, whose contract expires this summer, has seen talks over an extension at Stamford Bridge stall and is now considering his options, including interest from both PSG and clubs in Saudi Arabia."

Costa has long been admired at United but 90min understands the 23-year-old is one of a handful of names on a shortlist which also includes Brentford's David Raya, among others. Asked about a possible move to Old Trafford after the Taca de Portugal final on Sunday, Costa made it clear that he is not listening to the speculation. ""That's the internet,"" the goalkeeper said of the rumours. feed He added: ""I love Porto, itâs the club of my life. I would give my life for it. My life is resolved with Porto. It is a happiness and an honour to play for my favourite club. ""What they say is what they say, there is nothing concrete, I have a contract until 2027 and I hope to continue, letâs see."" De Gea came under fire from United fans after his performance in the FA Cup final defeat to Manchester City, failing to keep out Ilkay Gundogan's tame winner and struggling with the ball at his feet. Manager Erik ten Hag, who has publicly admitted his wish to sign a new goalkeeper, has tried to shield De Gea from the criticism but did concede 'there are issues' with the Spaniard's style of play."

Mason Mount quizzed on potential move to Manchester United,"Jun 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/mason-mount-quizzed-potential-move-manchester-united,"Mason Mount has been questioned about his potential move to Manchester United at the Spanish Grand Prix. 90min reported earlier in the week Mount's representatives had agreed personal terms in principle with Man Utd ahead of a summer move to Old Trafford. Liverpool, Arsenal and Newcastle United have also spoken to the midfielder after talks with current club Chelsea regarding a new contract stalled.

Real Madrid to step up Harry Kane pursuit after Karim Benzema exit,"Jun 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/real-madrid-step-up-harry-kane-pursuit-karim-benzema-exit,"Real Madrid are prepared to step up their pursuit of Tottenham striker Harry Kane after confirming the departure of Karim Benzema, 90min understands. Benzema had been expected to announce his exit from Real on Saturday during a press conference but kept his cards close to his chest and was later understood to have decided to stay in Madrid for at least another season. However, the Frenchman returned to his original decision and Real confirmed on Sunday the veteran striker would depart this summer after 14 years at the Santiago Bernabeu. As 90min reported earlier this month, Kane has been identified as Carlo Ancelotti's preferred replacement for the departing Frenchman and sources have confirmed plans are being put in place to try to lure Kane over to Madrid. Kane sits atop a shortlist which includes a number of possible targets, including Chelsea's Kai Havertz, Napoli's Victor Osimhen and Espanyol's Joselu, and Real officials are keen to force their way to the front of the queue for his signature. feed Kane has just one year left on his contract at Tottenham and is the subject of interest from both Manchester United and Bayern Munich, but Real's pressing need for a new striker has seen them enter the race. Spurs chairman Daniel Levy does not want to sell Kane but would prefer to do business with an overseas club if his hand is forced, which could give Real the edge. However, convincing Kane to leave England, where he sits just 47 goals behind Alan Shearer in the Premier League's all-time scoring charts, is not expected to be an easy task for Real or any other overseas suitor. Real Madrid are prepared to reshuffle their forward line this summer after confirming the departures of Benzema, Marco Asensio, Mariano Diaz and Eden Hazard on free transfers, leaving them light on options for next season. As it stands, only Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo and 18-year-old Alvaro Rodriguez are contracted to Real next year when it comes to forwards, forcing Los Blancos into action this summer."

Unfortunately for Arsenal, it appears they will have to look elsewhere as manager Xavi has insisted Raphinha will not be leaving Camp Nou this summer. ""Raphinha is not on the market,"" Xavi told the media. ""Heâs staying at Barcelona and will help us a lot. Heâs a crucial player for me and a really important player. He makes the difference."" feed Raphinha has been a regular on the right side of Xavi's attack this season, racking up ten goals and 12 assists in 49 appearances ahead of the season finale against Celta Vigo on Sunday. It was on that same right wing that Messi made his name at Camp Nou and so, with the veteran Argentine in line for a possible return this summer, questions have been raised about Raphinha's place in the team if Messi does join. However, Xavi has already made it clear that Messi may no longer be a winger, recently revealing his plans to fit the World Cup winner into his team. While Raphinha's place at Camp Nou appears safe, there are doubts over the future of Torres, another Arsenal target, and 20-year-old Ansu Fati."

Paying his respects to Rayo in an interview to AS, Garcia acknowledged everything he has done so far in his career has been with a view to earning a chance at the Santiago Bernabeu. ""I've never hidden it,"" he said. ""I am a clear and sincere person. I came to show that I'm ready and that I can take that step that every Madrid youth player goes looking for. The work is there.

I am young and I have to keep learning every day."" On what he will bring to Real's first team, Garcia added: ""I am a player who gives 100% all the time. I have a lot of energy and power.

Eden Hazard agrees to terminate Real Madrid contract,"Jun 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/eden-hazard-terminate-real-madrid-contract,"Real Madrid have confirmed that Eden Hazard will leave the club on a free transfer at the end of the current campaign. The Belgian, who joined from Chelsea in an enormous deal which could climb up to Â£150m, has struggled horribly with injuries during his time in Spain and has tumbled right to the bottom of the pecking order. Hazard's contract in Madrid still has one year to run but Real have now confirmed the winger will be released from his deal 12 months early.

Sergio Ramos: Potential destinations as former Real Madrid star confirms PSG departure,"Jun 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/sergio-ramos-potential-destinations-former-real-madrid-star-confirms-psg-departure,"As the enigmatic winner of every trophy imaginable, Sergio Ramos is surely destined for a spot among the game's pantheon of greats. However, when the time comes to parse through Ramos' glittering career, the two years he spent at Paris Saint-Germain will serve as little more than a forgotten footnote. Ramos almost had his deal terminated after limping through his first three months in Paris on the sidelines. The centre-back's second appearance for the club, in December, brought a trademark red card. Once fit enough to be a regular, Ramos couldn't transpose his Champions League-winning pedigree onto the dysfunctional unit, failing to preside over a single clean sheet in European competition. With 37 years and almost as many titles to his name, Ramos could live up to his pirate aesthetic and happily sail off into the sunset. Yet, while signing off at PSG he promised: ""I will face new challenges, I will wear other colours."" Here are some possible shades Ramos could don next season. Cristiano Ronaldo's view of Middle Eastern football has dramatically changed over the course of six months. After distancing himself from a move to Saudi Arabia in his infamous interview with Piers Morgan, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner is now calling for ""big players and big names"" to join him in the kingdom.Ramos played 340 matches alongside Ronaldo at Real Madrid but endured a complicated relationship with the demanding forward. Contact between the duo has been limited since Ronaldo joined Juventus in 2018 but they could be reunited at Al Nassr this summer. Ronaldo may have propelled Al Nassr to prominence following his arrival but Al Hilal are Saudi Arabia's traditional elite.In the midst of a transfer ban when Ronaldo arrived at Al Nassr after the winter World Cup, Al Hilal have relentlessly been linked with a gargantuan move for Lionel Messi, who is following Ramos out of the door at PSG this summer.Reports in France speak of an offer to quadruple Ramos' PSG wages - which were hardly insignificant - should he join on a free transfer this summer. With the Saudi top flight targeting as many as 20 high-profile players in the division next season, Ramos could be one of the arrivals. feed Inter Miami have been sniffing around Ramos since he entered the final months of his penultimate contract with Real Madrid in 2020. Three years on, the rugged centre-back isn't quite at the heights of that La Liga-winning vintage but whispers of a move to David Beckham's Inter persist.Beckham's former club LA Galaxy are also supposedly interested in the 37-year-old. Both clubs have made dire starts to the MLS season, with Inter propping up the Eastern Conference and Galaxy recording the worst defensive record in the western half of the division. 18-year-old Sergio Ramos for Sevilla during 2004/2005 season:â37 gamesâ½ï¸3 goalsâï¸14 clean sheetsGenerational talent. Beginning of a legend. pic.twitter.com/Ecl3KfQy0d When Ramos' mum warned him off following his first passion - bullfighting - he channelled his exuberance into football, rapidly rising through the ranks at Sevilla.Ramos only spent one full season in the senior side before joining Real Madrid, systematically eroding all of the good faith he had built during his time as a precocious teenager in Andalusia. As recently as March 2023, Sevilla had part of their stadium closed as a delayed punishment for abuse that the fans dished out to Ramos in 2017.However, there have been tentative rumours of a return to Spain for Ramos this summer. Victory in the Europa League final, and the prospect of Champions League football next season, makes Sevilla a more attractive destination but Ramos would have to stomach a hefty pay cut. After Real Madrid president Florentino Perez supposedly denied Ramos a lucrative move to China in 2019, the centre-back diplomatically outlined the bond between the two strong characters.""The president and I have a father-son relationship,"" Ramos said, ""we love each other a lot, the friction produces love."" However, in the intervening years, the love appears to have faded while the friction has increased.Putting aside the relationship between Perez and Ramos, Real Madrid have been uncharacteristically frugal in recent years, pinching the pennies and prioritising youth.While it would be a romantic return to the club that he captained to so much success, it remains unlikely."

Lloris does still have one year remaining on his contract but he confirmed to Nice Matin that he hopes to find an agreement to leave Spurs this summer and bring his 11-year association with the club to an end. ""We are coming to an important moment, for the club or for me,"" he began. ""It's the end of an era. I have desires for other things.

""My goal is to recover in July, then we'll see what the future holds for me."" feed Asked about links with a possible move to Saudi Arabia, Lloris appeared to stress he believes he is good enough to remain in Europe. ""You can't go from a successful World Cup to being an average player in a few months,"" the goalkeeper insisted. ""I had a few hard knocks, I was a little inconsistent in my performance, I got injured twice. I came out of the World Cup pretty dull. The pace had been hellish before that.  ""This is the first time in my career that I am unavailable. But I'm good in my head, in my body. This period will bring me freshness to still make me happy with my performance, my work. The most important thing is to find a project in which I flourish."" Lloris made 31 appearances in all competitions for Tottenham this season, with injury problems adding to what was a frustrating campaign for everyone at the club. ""It's not what we hoped for as a team,"" the Frenchman conceded. ""We made it halfway through the season rather well, in the Premier League and the Champions League. During the second part of the season, we experienced a lot of hard knocks on the collective level but also on the individual level with two injuries.  ""We failed as a team by not being able to reverse the course of things. It's disappointing but it's part of the life of a top-level football club. The most important thing is to prepare as well as possible for next season and to learn from our mistakes."""

His hauls of 12 goals in all competitions in both 2021/22 and 2022/23 weren't enough to earn him a regular starting spot under manager Carlo Ancelotti and he will leave the Bernabeu this summer for France. 90min revealed back in May Premier League side Aston Villa had offered a contract to the 27-year-old, but agent Jorge Mendes has since told Unai Emery's side that Asensio will instead join a PSG side led by Marquinhos and Kylian Mbappe. Asensio had previously attracted interest from Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Juventus and Marseille. feed The former Mallorca star made 285 appearances for Real and scored 61 goals in total, picking up three La Liga titles and three Champions Leagues amid other domestic and European honours. Villa still have their eyes on other wide options in La Liga, however. Barcelona duo Ansu Fati and Ferran Torres - neither of whom made massive contributions to the La Liga title win - have also been identified as potential alternatives. News of Asensio's imminent arrival at Parc des Princes comes soon after it was confirmed by manager Christophe Galtier that Lionel Messi will leave the Ligue 1 champions when his contract expires this summer."
Randal Kolo Muani drops major hint over Eintracht Frankfurt future,"Jun 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/randal-kolo-muani-drops-major-hint-eintracht-frankfurt-future,"Randal Kolo Muani has hinted he could stay at Eintracht Frankfurt this summer, despite clubs like Manchester United, Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich showing interest in the Frenchman. Kolo Muani only joined Frankfurt last summer on a free transfer when his contract with former club Nantes expired. But the 24-year-old, who scored 12 goals in Ligue 1 in 2021/22, went on to net 15 times in the Bundesliga and reached 23 in all competitions. He also made the international breakthrough with France, called up for Les Bleusâ 2022 World Cup squad. In fact, it was only a world class save from Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez in the 120th minute of the final that stopped Kolo Muani winning the World Cup for France. Frankfurt initially had no intention of selling the player, but chief executive Axel Hallmann later stated it would take an offer âdifferent than â¬90m, more than thisâ. Even then, Hallmann said Kolo Muani staying put would be the âabsolutely ideal scenarioâ. Now, Kolo Muani himself has spoken about his future and isnât itching for a transfer. feed ""I could stay,"" he told TMW. ""I have a long contract and as a result there is, of course, the possibility that I could still be the striker for Eintracht. The millions can be a pressure, but there will be another time to say goodbye. Now is not the right time."" Earlier this month, 90min revealed Bayern Munich had backed away from their longstanding interest in Harry Kane to avoid a protracted transfer saga, with the plan to target Kolo Muani instead. Bayern are unwilling to go as high as â¬100m, although the price tag didnât end talks. Manchester United are in the market for a striker this summer, having parted company with Cristiano Ronaldo in November and struggling with just Anthony Martial as the only recognised striker who is a permanent member of the first-team squad. Lionel Messiâs departure from PSG has now been confirmed, marking a blow to their front-line. Napoli consider Kolo Muani as a potential replacement for Victor Osimhen should he be sold this summer, while Atletico Madrid, Newcastle and Arsenal have all been keeping tabs on the player."
Potential Karim Benzema replacements at Real Madrid - ranked,"Jun 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/potential-karim-benzema-replacements-real-madrid-ranked,"In one of the most shocking turn of events of the 2022/23 season, Karim Benzema has told Real Madrid that he is set to leave the club this summer.  90min sources have confirmed that the 2022 Ballon d'Or winner is due to sign for Saudi Arabian club Al-Ittihad, and that means Real Madrid now need a new number nine.  To help the poor sods out, we at 90min have decided to list some candidates. Real Madrid, you're welcome... 90min understands that Dusan Vlahovic has requested to leave Juventus this summer after a rather torrid 2022/23 season at the club. And while that request to leave has opened the door for a Real Madrid to swoop in, that aforementioned 'rather torrid' season means it possibly wouldn't be the most exciting move to make. The Serbian has managed just 10 Serie A goals throughout the current campaign and, although the talent is there, the form just isn't right now. Fit? 4/10 Another Serie A striker, but this time one who is in the form of his life. Lautaro Martinez has been the catalyst for Inter winning the Coppa Italia and reaching the UEFA Champions League final against all the odds this season. He has the pedigree and winning mentality, but his very different skillset to Benzema makes drops him down this list. Fit? 5/10 feed That's right, another (yes, another) Serie A forward. Victor Osimhen is basically the best of both Vlahovic and Martinez rolled into one mask-wearing package. The Nigerian has enjoyed a career best season in front of goal - scoring 25 league goals - to inspire SSC Napoli to their first Scudetto in over 30 years, and he has that physical presence that Vlahovic possesses too. There's very little not to like...except maybe his â¬150m price tag. Fit? 7/10  In the words of Chandler Bing from 'Friends': Could Kylian Mbappe be any more Real Madrid? Mbappe exudes Real Madrid energy with his penchant for scoring big goals and general larger-than-life superstar personality. The problem is, however, that the forward looks all set to stay at PSG until his contract expires next summer. Fit? 9/10 So who can keep Real Madrid ticking over until they inevitably go out and sign Mbappe in 2024? Well Benzema 2.0 of course. Harry Kane is as close to carbon copy of Benzema that Los Blancos could possibly hope for. He's utterly brilliant and, with Spurs not managing to qualify for any European competition, he should be utterly available too. Fit? 10/10"

Tudor announced his departure from OM during a press conference on Friday ahead of the club's final game of the Ligue 1 season.  âIt was an honor to work for the club, for this family with supporters of the kind you so rarely find. On a personal level, I have grown. I leave the club in a better position than thee one I found it in,"" he said. âA season here is worth two or three seasons in another club."" Sources have confirmed to 90min that his departure has caught the attention of Juventus, who are due to decide the future of their current manager Allgri in the coming days.  feed Meetings are set to take place between La Vecchia Signora and Allegri following the club's final Serie A game of the season against Udinese at the Dacia Arena.  90min recently reported that the CEO of Juventus' parent company John Elkann was 'running out of patience' with Allegri following a string of disappointing results which saw them lose in both the Coppa Italia and Europa League semi-finals. If Tudor does indeed replace Allegri at Juve, he would be returning to the club where he spent nine successful years during his playing days. The Croatian won the Serie A on multiple occasions while in Turin and was also part of Andrea Pirlo's coaching staff when they lifted the Coppa Italia in 2021."
Karim Benzema informs Real Madrid he will leave club,"Jun 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/karim-benzema-informs-real-madrid-he-will-leave-club,"Real Madrid captain Karim Benzema has informed Los Blancos president Florentino Perez that will leave the club when his contract expires at the end of this month, 90min understands. Benzema will bring down the curtain on a glittering 14-year stay at the Bernabeu and pursue a new opportunity in Saudi Arabia with newly crowned Saudi Pro League champions Al-Ittihad. 90min understands that Benzema had his pick of clubs but opted for Al-Ittihad, which means lining up on the opposite side to former Real teammate Cristiano Ronaldo next season â Ronaldo joined Al-Nassr, who finished second in the final league table, in January. The contract that 35-year-old Benzema will sign with Al-Ittihad is set to run until 2025, with a basic annual wage of â¬100m that stands to be further inflated by other bonuses. feed Benzema had originally agreed, but not signed, a new one-year contract with Real. But he later changed his mind and is opting to leave Europe altogether, having won five UEFA Champions Leagues, four La Liga titles, three Copa del Reys and 12 other trophies. 90min already reported on Thursday morning that Real have identified Tottenham striker Harry Kane as their first choice to replace Benzema, who first moved to Madrid from Lyon in 2009. Luka Modric is another player linked with a summer switch to Saudi Arabia. The Croatian is yet to sign a proposed contract extension, but Real sources insist he will stay at the club."
Man Utd learn transfer fee needed to sign Atalanta striker Rasmus Hojlund,"Jun 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-learn-transfer-fee-needed-sign-atalanta-striker-rasmus-hojlund,"Atalanta will not sell Rasmus Hojlund cheaply this summer despite the in-demand striker's request to leave, sources have told 90min. Hojlund joined Atalanta in a â¬17m deal last summer from Sturm Graz, who themselves had only signed him from Copenhagen the previous January. The Dane has scored eight goals in 31 Serie A appearances this season and has attracted interest from Manchester United. 90min understands Hojlund has made it clear to the Serie A club through agents SEG that he would like to move on following their failure to qualify for the Champions League. Chelsea have already held talks with Atalanta about a possible deal, with Atalanta chief executive Luca Percassi visiting England in April for exploratory discussions. Man Utd are now talking with Percassi, while Arsenal, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain have also touched base with Atalanta and the player's agents. SEG are also the agents of United manager Erik ten Hag, who has been looking at Hojlund for much of this year. feed United's prefered plan is to bring in two strikers this summer. The Red Devils are targeting one younger option and a more established version. Hojlund would fit into the former category, but he would not come cheap. 90min understands United among other suitors have been informed by Atalanta it will take â¬65m to â¬70m (Â£55m) to prise the 20-year-old away from Gewiss Stadium. That figure would see Atalanta earn more than quadruple what they paid for him in just one season. As well as Hojlund, United are still assessing other targets such as Harry Kane, Victor Osimhen, Lauturo Martinez, Benjamin Sesko, Mohammed Kudus and Randal Kolo-Muani."
Dusan Vlahovic tells Juventus he wants to leave,"Jun 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/dusan-vlahovic-tells-juventus-wants-leave,"Dusan Vlahovic has informed Juventus he wants to leave the club this summer amid interest from Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Manchester United, 90min understands.  The 23-year-old signed for Juventus in 2022 for â¬70m but has struggled for form during his first full season at the Allianz Stadium. Vlahovic, following two seasons in which he managed over 20 Serie A goals, has managed to find the back of the net just ten times in the league this season. After a disappointing 2022/23 campaign under defensive-minded manager Massimiliano Allegri at Juventus, sources have confirmed to 90min the player has now asked to leave the club. Despite a poor season in front of goal Vlahovic has plenty of suitors ahead of the summer transfer window. Bayern Munich are very keen to sign the striker having been without an out-and-out number nine since the departure of Robert Lewandowski last summer, with Sky Sports Germany stating Thomas Tuchel is pushing for the club to sanction a move.  feed 90min understands Manchester United retain an interest in the striker and see him as a 'first box' option alongside Harry Kane, Victor Osimhen and Lautaro Martinez this summer, while Chelsea are also keeping an eye on the situation too. Juve, however, have told Vlahovic to wait until the club sort out their managerial situation before making a decision on his future. Rumours have been swirling recently about the long-term future of Allegri at the club, with Antonio Conte being linked with a return this summer. Vlahovic's representatives have insisted the player wants to leave La Vecchia Signora no matter who takes charge. Speaking to DAZN recently, Juventus CFO Francesco Calvo insisted Vlahovic will not be sold. ""Rumours are not something we can control, but the transfer market hasn't even opened yet. Dusan is not for sale. We are satisfied with the effort he puts in, although everyone in life can do better."""

Neymar could join Messi in leaving PSG this summer, having attracted interest from Newcastle United. 90min reported in early May that the club's owners PIF are keen to make Neymar a 'marquee' summer signing ahead of their first jaunt into the UEFA Champions League in two decades. One superstar who looks set to stay put is Kylian Mbappe, who stated he will be at PSG next season during the UNFP awards.

Colwill was one of the breakout starlets of the 2022/23 Premier League season, putting in eye-catching performances while out on loan at Brighton. The 20-year-old became a regular at the AMEX Stadium following Roberto De Zerbi's appointment as manager and was key in the club's qualification for next season's UEFA Europa League.  As expected, Brighton are now keen to sign the defender on a permanent deal, with Sky Sports reporting that the club lodged a Â£30m for the player's services. Sources have confirmed to 90min however that Colwill's parent club Chelsea consider the defender to be unsellable and are keen to see how he performs in pre-season under new manager Mauricio Pochettino. feed After a pre-season assessment there does remain the possibility that Colwill will be sent out on loan for another campaign, but there is no scope for a permanent departure. Chelsea are keen to sell 12-14 first-team players during the upcoming summer transfer window. 90min understands one player set to leave is Mason Mount, who has agreed personal terms with Manchester United ahead of a move. Mount has been heavily linked with a number of different clubs in recent weeks - including Liverpool and Arsenal - due to the Blues' difficulty in tying the midfielder down to a long-term deal at Stamford Bridge."

The transfer is expected to be worth an initial â¬100m with a further â¬50m in add-ons.

Harry Kane tops Real Madrid's list to replace Karim Benzema,"Jun 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/harry-kane-real-madrid-list-to-replace-karim-benzema,"Harry Kane is Real Madrid's first choice to replace Karim Benzema if he opts to move to Saudi Arabian club Al-Ittihad, sources have told 90min. Madrid have long been admirers of Kane, but they were not anticipating needing to replace Benzema until next summer as he had agreed terms to stay in the Spanish capital for another 12-months. However, Benzema's deal has remained unsigned and now he is understood to be close to agreeing a two-year deal to join Saudi Arabia's Pro-League with Al-Ittihad. Now Real's transfer team, led by Juni Calafat, are putting plans in place to replace Benzema and 90min has been told that Kane is their top target having already done plenty of background work on Tottenham's captain. Tottenham's hierarchy have already made it clear that they were not looking to sell Kane this summer, despite the fact he has just one year left on his current deal. feed Kane is also Manchester United's first choice transfer target this summer, but Spurs CEO Daniel Levy is not keen to do business with any other Premier League. That fact could very well open the door to Madrid, however much will depend on Kane's own position on his future and, as yet, he has not pushed to leave the club this summer. Should a move for Kane prove too difficult, as may be the case, they have other options in mind. One of these other options is Napoli's Victor Osimhen - another United target but also one who is very high on Chelsea's summer shopping list.

Mbappe has also recently confirmed his desire to stay at PSG for at least one more season during the recent UNFP awards ceremony.

Talks over a new deal have stalled in recent months, though Chelsea always held out hope of persuading their homegrown star to remain.

But sources have confirmed to 90min that it is City who have started their approach. Chelsea are not expected to make it difficult for Kovacic to leave Stamford Bridge.

Joao Cancelo: Potential destinations for Man City star after Bayern loan ends,"May 31, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/joao-cancelo-potential-destinations-man-city-bayern-loan,"Pep Guardiola raised the collective eyebrow of the footballing world when he opted to dump unicorn full-back off to Bayern Munich midway through the 2022/23 season. Canelo, an utterly unique footballer given his skillset, once appeared to be an indispensable member of City's juggernaut, but a diminished role after the 2022 World Cup saw his relationship with the boss become somewhat strained.  Guardiola's change in tack saw the introduction of four centre-backs across City's defensive line which left little room for Cancelo.  A loan move to Bayern followed in January with both of the clubs Cancelo represented in 2022/23 ending the season as champions. Everyone's a winner! However, with his future at City up in the air and a permanent move to Bayern far from guaranteed, there are doubts over where the Portuguese international will be playing his football next season.  Cancelo, however, does have a number of suitors.  Barcelona's ambition knows no bounds despite their financial misery, and 90min understands that Cancelo, a player they've had their eye on for a while, is on their summer wish list.A January move was impossible due to La Liga's Financial Fair Play regulations but with Jordi Alba now a goner and Jules Kounde looking to play centrally, there's potentially space on either side of Barca's defence.Re-signing Lionel Messi is the club's priority, which would make any kind of permanent deal for Cancelo difficult to achieve, but there's no knowing just how many levers Joan Laporta has left to pull in order to get what he wants. Arsenal are never too far away when a player wants out of Manchester City. The Gunners snapped up Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko last summer, with both playing leading roles in the club's excellent 2022/23 season that for so long looked like would culminate in Premier League glory.The Cityzens, in the absence of Cancelo, however, woke up down the stretch and eventually strolled to their third-straight title. `A busy summer beckons in north London as Arsenal attempt to bridge the gap between themselves and the champions, and sources have confirmed to 90min that Cancelo is of interest. Mikel Arteta only briefly worked with the full-back in Manchester, and there's no doubt the Portuguese international would thrive within his framework.However, will City make the same mistake and allow a player of Cancelo's talent to waltz into the lap of a potential title contender for years to come? That remains to be seen. Bayern have first dibs on Cancelo this summer, owing to the â¬70m optional purchase clause in his loan deal, but it's unlikely that will be triggered.Instead, rather than walk away from him altogether, Bayern may look to do business at around â¬40m to â¬50m - prices that are a little more reflective of Cancelo's standing in the market.With Benjamin Pavard's future uncertain - he's generating interest from Manchester United among others - that may be a smart route for the Bavarians to take."

Atletico Madrid president confirms Chelsea decision over Joao Felix transfer,"May 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/atletico-madrid-president-confirms-chelsea-decision-over-joao-felix-transfer,"Atletico Madrid president Enrique Cerezo has confirmed that Chelsea do not plan to pursue a permanent deal for on-loan forward Joao Felix. Felix joined Chelsea in January on an expensive six-month loan deal which did not include an option to buy, but club officials had been in negotiations with Atletico to determine the cost of a permanent transfer. Those talks began while Graham Potter was in charge, however, and with Mauricio Pochettino now in the dugout, the situation has changed and it is the Argentine who has made the final call on Felix's future. ""The truth is that I can't tell you the plan with Joao,"" Cerezo said. ""It's the news we had yesterday, that the new coach doesn't count on him for Chelsea.  ""We don't have anything planned yet, Joao is an Atletico player now."" feed Felix has spoken openly about his desire to remain at Stamford Bridge beyond this summer but now appears set to return to Atletico, ending his stint in England with four goals in 20 appearances for Chelsea. The 23-year-old remains under contract with Atletico until 2027 and Chelsea always had concerns over the cost of any potential deal, and at Pochettino's request, have now abandoned plans to pursue a permanent transfer. Chelsea have already wrapped up the signing of Christopher Nkunku from RB Leipzig and will welcome both Malo Gusto and Levi Colwill back from their respective loan deals as Pochettino's squad continues to grow. Talks have also been held over Sporting CP midfielder Manuel Ugarte, while Brighton's Moises Caicedo and West Ham's Declan Rice are of interest as well."
Liverpool confident of completing Alexis Mac Allister transfer,"May 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-confident-alexis-mac-allister-transfer,"Liverpool believe they are close to finalising an agreement to sign Brighton midfielder Alexis Mac Allister, 90min understands, Mac Allister, who played an integral role in Argentina's World Cup triumph, is being chased by most of the Premier League's elite and is expected to move on this summer, with Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi recently admitting the 24-year-old has likely played his final game for the club. With the season now over, Liverpool's focus is firmly on bolstering for the upcoming campaign, and Mac Allister is one of the Reds' top targets. The Brighton midfielder and his representatives have spent the past few months discussing his future with a number of clubs - Chelsea and Manchester United are known admirers - but sources have confirmed to 90min that Liverpool are leading the race for Mac Allister's signature. Personal terms have already been agreed in principle between Mac Allister and Liverpool, who have voiced a willingness to meet Brighton's asking price of around Â£70m. feed Liverpool are growing in confidence that they are close to getting a deal done and are pushing for a firm agreement as soon as possible, which would allow them to focus their efforts on other reinforcements. Mac Allister, who has been in Italy to attend the wedding of Argentina teammate Lautaro Martinez, is expected to make a final decision on his future in the coming days. Liverpool hired Jorg Schmadtke as their new sporting director on Tuesday, with the German brought in to help the Reds in their transfer dealings. Finding a new midfielder is a key goal for Liverpool, who had been planning a move for Borussia Dortmund's Jude Bellingham this summer. However, financial concerns saw them pull out of the race towards the end of the season and focus their efforts elsewhere. They were among the early suitors of Chelsea's Mason Mount, who will be sold this summer if an agreement over a new contract cannot be reached, but both Arsenal and Manchester United are preparing to launch rival bids."

Chelsea hold talks over PSG target Manuel Ugarte,"May 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-talks-psg-target-manuel-ugarte,"Chelsea have opened talks over a deal to sign Sporting CP midfielder Manuel Ugarte, 90min understands. A new midfielder has long been on Chelsea's agenda for this summer even before the arrival of new manager Mauricio Pochettino, whose move to Stamford Bridge was finally made official on Monday. Chelsea scouts have drawn up a long list of potential targets and 90min understands that 22-year-old Sporting midfielder Ugarte has emerged as a player of interest, with the Blues reaching out to discuss a possible deal. Paris Saint-Germain are also chasing Ugarte and recently struck an agreement over personal terms with the Uruguay international. The French side are looking to avoid paying his â¬60m release clause up front and are attempting to negotiate a payment plan. It is understood that the Parisians' pursuit of Ugarte is slightly more advanced at this stage, but Chelsea remain in talks over a deal which, if completed, would be the first of the Pochettino era. manual Sporting manager Ruben Amorim recently confessed his club face an uphill battle to keep hold of Ugarte after their failure to qualify for next season's Champions League. ""Obviously itâs difficult to keep players like him, there are several clubs interested, not just one, knowing that our project is not sold and that we missed the Champions League,"" Amorim said. ""It makes everything more difficult."" Chelsea's midfield transfer plans will depend on how many players are sold this summer. Talks are ongoing with N'Golo Kante, who is evaluating his options, while Mateo Kovacic will enter the final 12 months of his contract and could be sold amid interest from a number of Premier League rivals. Alongside Ugarte on Chelsea's radar are West Ham United's Declan Rice and Brighton's Moises Caicedo but, with England's elite all keen on the expensive duo, the Blues are keen to take closer looks at a number of targets.

The strikers Mauricio Pochettino should sign for Chelsea,"May 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/the-strikers-mauricio-pochettino-should-sign-for-chelsea,"You don't need to be Mauricio Pochettino to recognise just how much Chelsea need a new striker. The Blues have been 'bolstering' in attack for the last five years and yet still boast some of the worst goalscoring numbers in the Premier League. With Pochettino now installed in the dugout, it's the Argentine's turn to try and figure out a solution. Here are some strikers he could turn to. manual As one of Europe's top marksmen this season, Napoli hotshot Victor Osimhen is an obvious candidate here.Citing Didier Drogba as his idol, 24-year-old Osimhen has been outrageous this year, leading Serie A's scoring charts and helping turn the Partenopei into one of the continent's leading sides.The main issue here is Osimhen's price tag. Napoli agreed to pay up to â¬80m when they signed him from Lille in 2020 and the belief is he could cost twice as much as that this time around. Yikes. If you want a striker with Premier League experience, Ivan Toney appears the most feasible option. Well, that was until his eight-month ban for gambling offences.With his season now over, Toney ends the campaign with 20 league goals for Brentford. The last time Chelsea had a player reach that number? Diego Costa, six years ago.The ban obviously complicates things. Toney is not permitted to return to action until late January, 2024. That sounds like a discount. The cream of the crop when it comes to attainable Premier League strikers, Tottenham's Harry Kane may jump at the chance to reunite with the man who set him off on the journey to superstardom.Pochettino knows how Kane works and the pair's relationship remains strong. With his situation at Spurs growing more and more uncomfortable, the chance to jump ship may be too strong.Would Spurs ever sell to Chelsea? There's your real dilemma."
Newcastle confident over new Bruno Guimaraes contract despite Barcelona interest,"May 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/newcastle-confident-over-new-bruno-guimaraes-contract-despite-barcelona-interest,"Newcastle United remain unconcerned by the interest being shown in midfielder Bruno Guimaraes, 90min understands, with plans to tie the Brazilian down to a new contract still very much on track. Guimaraes has helped transform Newcastle into a genuine force since his arrival in January 2022, establishing himself as one of the influential midfielders in the Premier League as the Magpies sealed fourth place this season under Eddie Howe. His form has attracted interest from a number of sides across Europe, with Barcelona and Real Madrid both known to be keeping an eye on his situation, but sources have confirmed to 90min that Newcastle have no concerns about losing Guimaraes this summer. 90min understands that Guimaraes is very happy at St James' Park and has been in talks over a huge new contract for months, and Newcastle are confident they will have wrapped up an extension for the midfielder before the new season begins. feed While Barcelona are known to be fans of Guimaraes, he is not believed to be among their top priorities heading into a summer in which the La Liga champions are not expected to have the sort of money needed to complete such a deal. Instead, impending free agent Ilkay Gundogan of Manchester City remains a key target, while Real Sociedad's Martin Zubimendi has also been identified as a preferred replacement for the departing Sergio Busquets at the base of midfield - a position manager Xavi has publicly highlighted as his main concern. Bernardo Silva, Gundogan's City teammate, is also high on Xavi's wish list, while a large portion of the club's spare finances has currently been set aside for their push to re-sign Lionel Messi from Paris Saint-Germain. Barcelona will not make any major decisions on their transfer strategy until La Liga approve their budget for the summer, with Messi expected to be a top priority, while Barcelona also need to find the salary to register Gavi and Ronald Araujo's new contracts."
Mason Mount sends message to Chelsea fans ahead of uncertain summer,"May 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/mason-mount-sends-message-to-chelsea-fans-ahead-of-uncertain-summer,"Mason Mount has praised Chelsea fans for their support over this past season as he heads for a 'break' over the summer. Having missed the end of Chelsea's season with a pelvic injury, there is a real possibility that Mount may have played his last game for the Blues as he approaches a summer transfer window in which he could be sold. Mount will enter the final year of his contract and has been warned he will be sold this summer if he does not agree an extension. All offers thus far have failed to tempt the midfielder but talks have not yet been ended, with incoming manager Mauricio Pochettino known to be keen to keep hold of Mount. After Sunday's 1-1 draw to close out the season at Stamford Bridge, Mount took part in the lap of appreciation for fans, with Ben Chilwell putting his arm around his close friend as they approached the tunnel. Mount later took to Instagram to send a message to Chelsea fans after what has undoubtedly been a challenging campaign. feed âItâs fair to say itâs been an up and down season but your support has never dipped,"" he began. ""Travelling around the country, you were with us every step of the way and at times we didnât deserve you. But now itâs time to have a break and recover... Thank you and enjoy your summer bluesâ Chelsea have not yet given up hope of keeping Mount, with Pochettino pushing to keep the England international, but club officials are prepared to cash in on one of their most valuable assets before he enters the final 12 months of his contract. Premier League rivals like Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United are all known to be keen to take advantage of the situation and are readying bids for the 24-year-old if he does hit the market."
Dejan Kulusevski unsure about Tottenham future after loan expires,"May 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/dejan-kulusevski-unsure-tottenham-future-loan-expires,"Dejan Kulusevski has admitted that he doesn't know if he'll return to Tottenham Hotspur following the last game of his loan deal.  The wide forward has been on loan at Tottenham since January 2022 on an initial 18-month loan. Tottenham would have had an obligation to sign the player on a permanent deal for a reported Â£30m, but their failure to qualify for the UEFA Champions League - having finishing eighth in the Premier League - means that said obligation was not triggered.  Due to this, rumours have begun to swirl regarding the Swede's future with the Lilywhites after it previously seemed like a forgone conclusion that he'd sign a long-term deal in north London.  Speaking after his final game, a 4-1 win over relegated Leeds United before his scheduled return to parent club Juventus, Kulusevski admitted he was unsure where his future lies. feed âI don't know, honestly, we will see,"" Kulusevski confessed. ""I am just focused on the pitch, I tried to do as good as I can and now of course it's time to speak with the club.â The 23-year-old has generally impressed at Tottenham when fit, bagging seven assists during his full season at the club. At the tail end of the 2021/22 campaign Kulusevski was arguably the club's best player (along with Harry Kane obviously), scoring five and bagging eight assists in 18 games as Tottenham rallied to secure Champions League football.  Injuries have largely hindered his progress however, with a thigh injury seeing him miss 10 games this season.  Kulusevski ends his loan with Tottenham having made 57 appearances in all competitions, scoring seven goals and adding 16 assists."

Roberto De Zerbi confirms Alexis Mac Allister and Moises Caicedo transfer decision,"May 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/roberto-de-zerbi-confirms-alexis-mac-allister-and-moises-caicedo-transfer-decision,"Brighton and Hove Albion manager Roberto De Zerbi has confirmed that Alexis Mac Allister and Moises Caicedo have played their 'last game' for the club.  The pair both featured in Brighton's 2-1 defeat at the hands of Aston Villa on the final day of the season, with Mac Allister playing the full 90 minutes while Caicedo was a half-time substitute. Despite the defeat, Brighton have secured UEFA Europa League football for the 2023/24 season, finishing in sixth place at the end of what's been a stunning campaign for the club.  Unfortunately for the Seagulls fans however, they will have to play in the Europa League without their two star midfielders after De Zerbi confirmed both were set to leave the club: âYes, I think it can be the last game for Alexis and Moises Caicedo.

The best players available to sign from relegated Premier League sides,"May 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/the-best-players-available-to-sign-relegated-premier-league-sides-,"There is always a frenzy of shopping in the Premier League once it is confirmed who will be heading down to the Championship. That scenario is likely to play out this summer in particular, with some exceptionally talented squads underperforming and a whole host of talented players dropping down out of the top flight as a result. Everton live to fight another day but, arguably, the real gems for now and in the future can be found at Leicester, Leeds and Southampton - all of whom have surrendered their spot among the elite. Here's the ten best players likely to be on the move this summer. How on earth have Leicester City been relegated? That's the question many people are asking. Not only are the Foxes down just seven years after stunning the world to win the Premier League title, they are going to lose a number of really, really good players. One of the first out of the door will surely be James Maddison, who has been linked with Manchester United, Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal in the past. His most likely landing spot? Quite possibly Newcastle, who are entering the Champions League and could really do with a player of his creative quality. Possible destinations: Manchester United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal, Newcastle Romeo Lavia has been one of the rare bright spots of a terrible Southampton season. Aged just 19, he has shown incredible composure in central midfield, competing at an exceptionally high level despite things collapsing around him. Chelsea and Liverpool are two of the more logical landing spots and he may be seen by Arsenal as a cheaper alternative to West Ham's Declan Rice. Manchester United and Manchester City have also been linked, though the latter's Â£40m buy-back clause doesn't kick in until 2024. Possible destinations: Manchester United. Chelsea. Liverpool. Tottenham. Manchester City Robin Koch has not enjoyed himself at Leeds United this season, but anybody with a pair of eyes will know his level has been dragged down by those around him. A move away from Elland Road feels like an inevitably, with Newcastle heavily linked as they need more depth in central defence. A versatile operator who is just 26, Koch will also have his pick of clubs back home in the Bundesliga, should any of the top brass feel he's attainable for under Â£20m. Possible destinations: Newcastle, Tottenham, Bayer Leverkusen It has been a very unusual season for Wilfried Gnonto. For a patch of time, he was the darling of both Leeds United and the Italian national team, but the departure of Jesse Marsch as coach saw his playing time reduce drastically under Javi Gracia. Having paid just â¬4.5m for the former Inter youngster, Leeds could make a serious profit on a player who showed in a very short space of time what he's capable of. A Premier League stay would be nice but the queue of clubs wanting to take Gnonto back to Serie A is growing. Possible destinations: Sassuolo, Napoli, Inter, Lazio, Fiorentina, Chelsea, PSG If there's one player who has given their all for the cause, it's Southampton captain James Ward-Prowse. The 28-year-old has been the heartbeat of the Saints for the best part of a decade and is one of the world's best free-kick takers. He's also a leader who knows the Premier League inside out, making him an exceptionally appetising prospect. Ward-Prowse regularly knocks on the door of England squad's, which tells you all you need to know about the level of club he could join. Possible destinations: Newcastle, Aston Villa, West Ham This is a situation that Leicester will wish they had handled differently. Youri Tielemans is out of contract on June 30, 2023, so is now certain to leave on a free transfer. Not so long ago, the Belgian was being linked with a move away for around Â£60m - money that could have been reinvested effectively by Leicester. As it is, he will leave for nothing, with Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United potential landing spots. Roma also like Tielemans and he's shown a willingness to move to different countries in the past. Possible destinations: Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Roma, Newcastle If there's one player who really doesn't deserve to go down, based on individual performances alone, it's Harvey Barnes. A scorer of 13 Premier League goals, Barnes showed time and again during 2022/23 just how dangerous he can be on the left flank. A quick, direct runner, he has a keen appetite for goal and is a winger who is genuinely good with both feet. Leicester may still be able to demand up to Â£50m for Barnes, but he's not going to be short of suitors. Newcastle, Aston Villa and West Ham are among those to have been linked, but don't rule out a top side coming in. Possible destinations: Newcastle, Aston Villa, West Ham Jack Harrison is still only 26 years old and has shown during Leeds United's time in the Premier League that he can cut it at that level. Harrison actually travelled to Leicester in January for a medical but the move fell through at the last minute. A new contract was signed at Elland Road, but that may be rendered insignificant if a big-money offer comes in. Possible destinations: Newcastle, Aston Villa, West Ham Wilfred Ndidi was once regarded as one of Europe's best defensive midfielders - it's been some fall from grace during Leicester's season of struggle. But that shouldn't detract from the quality that the Nigerian has. Tireless with his running, Ndidi is strong in the tackle, excels at intercepting balls in the passing lane, and can help transition from defence into attack when things are going well. In a top side, Ndidi's abilities would undoubtedly come to the fore. Possible destinations: Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool Kyle Walker-Peters hasn't had a great time of things at Southampton, shipping 73 goals in a side that finished plum last in the table. But that's not a fair reflection on Walker-Peters' ability. Indeed, the 26-year-old has been hugely impressive on the south coast ever since he joined the club in 2020, even breaking into Gareth Southgate's England squad last year."
Marco Asensio: Potential destinations for Real Madrid forward this summer,"May 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/marco-asensio-potential-destinations-real-madrid-forward,"Marco Asensio has enjoyed a glittering career at Real Madrid, winning three Champions League crowns in addition to three La Liga titles. But life in the Spanish capital hasn't all been plain sailing for Asensio, who has struggled to command a regular place in the side and was also sidelined for most of the 2019/20 season with an anterior cruciate ligament tear. The 27-year-old has been a bit-part player under Carlo Ancelotti during 2022/23, despite notching 12 goals in all competitions, and speculation is rife that Asensio could be moving on when his contract expires this summer. Here's 90min's list of potential destinations for Asensio should he decide it's time to call it quits at Real. feed One of Asensio's most likely destinations is Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain, who are primed for a makeover up front as they prepare for life after Lionel Messi. Messi aside, PSG still boast two of the biggest names in world football - Kylian Mbappe and Neymar - and remain laser focused on conquering Europe and winning a maiden Champions League crown. Asensio has experience of doing that, which is something that PSG may consider while they weigh up whether to offer the Spaniard a contract or not. Asensio has never played a starring role at Real, but he's a supremely gifted footballer that has scored some crucial goals when the pressure is really on. Whether he fits into their current Christophe Galtier-led system is another matter, but the coach may not even be in the Parc des Princes dugout come next season. One of the Premier League's surprise packages this term, Aston Villa are eyeing ambitious summer transfer targets as they look to provide Unai Emery with the ammunition he needs to push on. Villa have previous of signing big name players, namely Philippe Coutinho - though the less said about his permanent switch to the Midlands, the better. Nevertheless, with Emery in charge, Villa have the ability to attract a calibre of player that was previously unattainable, and Asensio may be lured by the opportunity of playing in the Premier League under the Spaniard. Arsenal's desire to strengthen their squad is clear; you only need to listen to the words of manager Mikel Arteta and sporting director Edu to understand that. 90min understands that signing a new right winger to complement Bukayo Saka is high on the club's priority list, and they have been sounded out about taking Asensio to the Emirates Stadium. There is interest, given the possibility of signing a top class international for free, but there's no guarantee the switch would provide Asensio with the minutes he craves. Nonetheless, his arrival could release Saka to play in-field alongside Martin Odegaard, allowing Arteta the option to evolve his side and flex his formations depending on the calibre of opponent being faced. There's also the chance for Asensio to work under one of the Premier League's brightest young coaches. Luis Figo, Ronaldo and Michael Laudrup all have one extremely rare thing in common. Playing for Real Madrid and fierce rivals Barcelona. The Catalan giants have plenty of irons in the fire this summer, namely looking to lure Lionel Messi back to the club from Paris Saint-Germain. But the idea of Asensio drifting across to Camp Nou is one that was floated towards the back end of 2022, with the Spaniard doing little to dampen the speculation. Indeed, Asensio actually stoked the fire and discussed the possibility of joining Barcelona in the summer, only to retract his comments and claim that he'd been 'misinterpreted'. He couldn't, could he? Manchester United are another Premier League side whose ears have pricked up at the news of Asensio being available on a free, and it's easy to see why Erik ten Hag may be tempted. Antony is coming towards the end of a relatively slow first season in Manchester, as he looks to juggle the pressure that comes with being a near Â£100m signing. The Brazilian has shown glimpses of what he's capable of and there's high hopes that his best form is still to come. Still, the one burden on Antony's shoulders this season has been Ten Hag's inability to rotate. He lacks the depth in his squad to rest the 23-year-old and that's where Asensio could, in theory, come into the fold. Left-footed, technically gifted and with a sharp turn of pace, he's exactly the profile of inside forward that the Dutchman tends to like. Asensio isn't likely to come cheap though, with his hefty wages more than making up for the lack of a transfer fee. Still, he could follow in the footsteps of Raphael Varane and Casemiro by switching sunny Spain for a mild Manchester. Hoping their 2021/22 Serie A title will lure Asensio to Italy's capital, AC Milan would welcome the Mallorcan winger with open arms."
James Milner explains why he is leaving Liverpool,"May 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/james-milner-explains-why-leaving-liverpool,"James Milner has confirmed Liverpool's failure to offer him a new contract is the reason for his imminent departure, against the wishes of Jurgen Klopp. The 37-year-old is leaving the Reds after eight hugely successful seasons at Anfield, which have yielded Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup and Carabao Cup wins, and a Europa League runners-up medal. 90min reported at the beginning of May that Europa League-bound Brighton are pushing to complete a deal for Milner, with some experience at the highest level of continental competition designed to help Roberto De Zerbi's side take the next step in their exciting rise. But Milner's exit from Merseyside is not something Klopp was aligned with. The German is also saying goodbye to Roberto Firmino, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Naby Keita at the end of their contracts, leaving Liverpool exceptionally light in midfield. Alexis Mac Allister is expected to be a quick incoming, arriving in a big-money move, but Milner has confirmed recent reports that Klopp wanted to reward him with a new contract. ""It's all good because the manager wanted to keep me - which as a player is what you want,"" Milner said of why he is leaving. ""Obviously the club decided a different way. In my head it felt like it could be a good time, so I'm content with how it's all come about. ""It was probably about three weeks ago that I heard from the club. Because I hadn't heard anything, in my own mind I had probably decided myself that I would be going. feed âI will continue to play football, so yes I could be back in front of the Kop potentially. It's an option."" While Milner intends to continue playing, he did go on to speak about his post-retirement plans. The former Manchester City, Aston Villa and Leeds star revealed that he's at odds with himself sometimes about what to do next, though he recognises that not sharing his years of experience with others would be somewhat of a waste. ""Some days I think I'd love a go at management - and then other days you see a manager sign a new contract and six weeks later they get sacked.

Carlo Ancelotti responds to Real Madrid Marco Asensio exit rumours,"May 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/carlo-ancelotti-responds-real-madrid-marco-asensio-exit-rumours,"Carlo Ancelotti has admitted that he'll be disappointed if Marco Asensio leaves Real Madrid on a free transfer this summer. The 27-year-old's contract at the Santiago Bernabeu expires at the end of June and he is yet to put pen to paper on a new deal. Intermediaries and representatives of Asensio have been sounding out Europe's biggest clubs for a number of months over a potential move, and recent speculation has suggested that Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain are in advanced talks. Asensio played no part in Real Madrid's 2-1 win over Sevilla on Saturday night, earned by a brace from Brazilian forward Rodrygo, but Ancelotti was asked after the game about his position on Asensio and whether or not there was an update on his next steps. ""I donât know anything about Asensio, just like I donât know about others like Nacho. Itâll all be clarified in the coming weeks,"" the Italian confirmed. ""I would be sad if they left because they have been and are important players for us. Whatever they decide, weâll plan accordingly."" feed Real Madrid have put forward a new contract offer to Asensio but even though his preference has been to remain in the Spanish capital, there have been ongoing concerns about his lack of minutes. Indeed, just 13 of Asensio's 30 La Liga appearances have come as a starter, while he featured even less in the club's run to the Champions League semi-finals. He has still managed to contribute nine goals in La Liga and 12 in all competitions - matching his career-best tally from the 2021/22 season.  Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City are among a string of Premier League clubs to have shown interest in Asensio's situation, in addition to Bayern Munich, Juventus and Marseille from the continent. Asensio's final appearance for Real Madrid - if he does decide to leave for pastures new - could come against Athletic Club when the La Liga season concludes on 4 June."
Xavi reveals how Barcelona must replace Sergio Busquets,"May 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/xavi-how-barcelona-must-replace-sergio-busquets,"Barcelona manager Xavi has admitted that it's ""essential"" that the club find a top-quality replacement for the departing Sergio Busquets. The 34-year-old is leaving Camp Nou 15 years after breaking into the first team as a teenager, having won 32 major honours with the club. Busquets' trophy haul includes nine La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey triumphs and three Champions League crowns. Busquets has played over 700 games in all competitions for Barca and has been a staple of the side under Pep Guardiola, Tito Vilanova, Luis Enrique, Ernesto Valverde, Xavi and other managers. His departure will leave a huge void for Barca, who despite their abundance of quality midfielders, lack a player capable of filling Busquets' boots in the anchor role. Bayern Munich's Joshua Kimmich has been linked with a move to Camp Nou, while there's active interest in Real Sociedad midfielder Martin Zubimendi. Whatever Barca do, Xavi has admitted that the club must get their decision right if they are to continue competing for the major honours that they have won this season. ""Whoever is more complete, whoever is the best pivot to replace Busquets,"" Xavi replied when asked how he'll replace the Spaniard. ""We depend on âfair playâ and the economic situation. The profile must be a very determined player, who wins duels and is intelligent. The natural substitute for Busi. feed ""You have to find that piece. If we want to compete well next year, itâs essential. Busi has been fundamental to getting the Super Cup and La Liga. We have to find a very important player to replace Busquets.â Barca's precarious financial situation means a number of players will need to leave in order to facilitate incomings. Raphinha, Ferran Torres and Ansu Fati are among those who Barca could look to move on Camp Nou, while there's uncertainty over the future of Jules Kounde despite his denial of being unhappy at playing out of position. President Joan Laporta is moving heaven and earth to complete a fairytale return to Barcelona for Lionel Messi, while the club are actively engaging in talks with Manchester City captain Ilkay Gundogan. The 32-year-old German is available on a free transfer but isn't the same profile of player as Busquets - meaning another midfielder may still need to be targeted. Barca are also wanting to strengthen their squad with another striker and continue to show interest in another Manchester City player, Bernardo Silva."

Santos striker Marcos Leonardo scouted by Europe's elite at Under-20 World Cup,"May 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/santos-striker-marcos-leonardo-scouted-europe-elite-under-20-world-cup,"20-year-old Santos striker Marcos Leonardo is being watched closely by a number of clubs from across Europe at the Under-20 World Cup, 90min understands. Leonardo, who already has over 140 senior appearances for his club, started both of Brazil's first two group games, scoring twice in a 3-2 defeat to Italy before adding another goal in a 6-0 win over the Dominican Republic. His performances so far have only increased the excitement around Leonardo, who has long been on the radars of some of Europe's elite clubs, many of whom have sent scouts to the Under-20 World Cup for further reports on the striker. Indeed, sources have confirmed to 90min that Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain and Roma are all watching the 20-year-old, while there is plenty of Premier League interest as well. feed West Ham, who failed with a bid in the January transfer window to sign Leonardo, have been represented at the tournament in Poland to keep tabs on Leonardo, while Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United, Newcastle and Tottenham are all known admirers. Chelsea, who have stepped up their South American scouting with recent acquisitions of Andrey Santos and Kendry Paez, have taken a liking to the striker during their checks on teammate Santos. Leonardo has racked up 42 goals and ten assists for Santos, with his 13 strikes last season good enough for fifth place on the Serie A scoring charts. The 20-year-old, who cites Cristiano Ronaldo as his idol and has been compared to South American icon Sergio Aguero, is under contract in Brazil until the end of 2026."
Real Madrid close to Jude Bellingham agreement with Borussia Dortmund,"May 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/real-madrid-close-jude-bellingham-agreement-borussia-dortmund,"Real Madrid are close to agreeing the terms of a deal to sign Borussia Dortmund midfielder Jude Bellingham this summer, 90min understands. Most of Europe's elite have been chasing Bellingham over the past 12 months but Real moved clear in the race for his signature when they struck an agreement over personal terms with the 19-year-old last month. Bellingham, whose preference is to join Real this summer, has agreed the terms of a six-year contract in Madrid that will include a â¬1bn release clause. All that was left was an agreement between the two sides over a transfer fee. Dortmund have long made it clear that they are looking for around â¬150m to part ways with Bellingham and sources have now confirmed to 90min that Real have indicated a willingness to meet that figure. Meetings in Germany this week have seen Real and Dortmund agree the structure of a deal worth an initial â¬100m, with a further â¬50m in add-ons, to push the transfer closer to completion. feed 90min understands Real attempted to lower Dortmund's asking price by including a number of players, either on permanent or loan deals, but the German side insisted they wanted a cash-only offer. That being said, Dortmund have not yet ruled out the idea of returning to Real for potential signings of their own this summer, although any moves will be separate from Bellingham's proposed switch to the Santiago Bernabeu. An official announcement has been delayed by Real out of respect for Dortmund's Bundesliga title push. Edin Terzic's side sit top heading into Saturday's meeting with Mainz on the final day of the season and must match Bayern Munich's result against Koln if they are to get their hands on the trophy. Once that match is out of the way, Real will push ahead with their plans to finalise Bellingham's arrival and there is hope among the Spanish outfit that a deal can be announced next week. Los Blancos are also looking to recruit a new striker to compete with Karim Benzema, while they are eyeing up two new defenders as well. Carlo Ancelotti recently confirmed that Rayo Vallecano left-back Fran Garcia will join the club this summer but the Spanish side also hope to add an expensive new signing like RB Leipzig's Josko Gvardiol or Bayern Munich's Alphonso Davies - deals which both appear unlikely given the cost."
Jurgen Klopp sends firm transfer message to Liverpool stars over lack of Champions League football,"May 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jurgen-klopp-sends-firm-transfer-message-liverpool-stars-lack-champions-league-football,"Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has joked that he would personally drive any of his players to their new clubs if they chose to leave over the Reds' lack of Champions League football next season. Despite an outstanding recent run of form, Liverpool failed to climb their way back into the top four and will instead have to settle for the Europa League qualification that comes with finishing fifth. Star forward Mohamed Salah admitted he was 'totally devastated' to miss out on Europe's premier competition - issuing a social media apology which, bizarrely, has been interpreted by some as a desire to leave Anfield. Asked about Salah's feelings, Klopp laughed off the suggestions that the Egyptian might want to leave Liverpool this summer but made it clear that anybody frustrated by the lack of Champions League football will be happily allowed to leave. ""Mo loves being here,"" he said. ""He was part of the apologies for what we did, not apologies for what the other guys did. No, it is all fine. feed ""If ever a player comes to me and says: 'We didnât qualify for the Champions League, now I have to leave' then I would drive him to the other club. Iâd take the key and ask: 'Where do you want to go? I will drive you'. That would be something I would never understand. ""I would never say: 'I need to work in the Champions League so now I go'. I am responsible for this 'mess' or whatever. You cannot go in these moments. ""Nobody has asked me [about leaving]. They asked me if they could have a day longer holiday or whatever, but nobody asked me if after their holiday they have to come back. Thatâs not been in our conversations."" Klopp went on to insist that Liverpool's failure to reach the Champions League will not impact their transfer plans this summer. ""I don't think so but we will see,"" he explained. ""That is obviously possible, it's always possible things don't go as quick as you want. It's not only possible, it is probably likely.  ""The better the players you want the lesser is the desire of the other club to let him go and that's exactly what we are prepared for. But it's a long window and a long pre-season and a long break in-between so we have time. If we get in players tomorrow or in six or seven weeks it is not a game-changer for me to be honest. In an ideal world they all sign tomorrow and I can tell them when to be here and we can start giving them the plans for the summer break but that will not likely happen."""

Jules Kounde speaks out on transfer speculation,"May 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jules-kounde-speaks-out-on-transfer-speculation,"Jules Kounde has asserted that he does not intend to leave Barcelona this summer. 90min revealed earlier this week that BarÃ§a had been shocked by reports that the Frenchman was seeking an exit due to being played out of position for much of this season, and that they were not impressed with his conduct. However, Kounde has now refuted claims that he asked Barcelona to let him seek a new challenge only a year after signing from Sevilla. ""To make it clear, at no time did I ask to leave, and I'm not going anywhere,"" the defender said on Twitter. This statement dispels further speculation that arose when Barcelona's director of football, Mateu Alemany, failed to quell rumours of a potential exit after Tuesday's 3-1 defeat to Real Valladolid. Read the latest Barcelona news here feed Alemany at the time said: ""These are internal situations that we will resolve internally."" Head coach Xavi has since confirmed that he had discussed the matter with Kounde and asserted that they were on the same page. ""I spoke to him, yes, we were happy, and everything was clear.""I don't see any problems. We both came out of the meeting happy,"" Xavi insisted. Kounde has played a vital role in Xavi's team this season, helping them regain La Liga from Real Madrid. The club will look to strengthen this summer to compete on all fronts this season, but their financial challenges and the need to comply with La Liga's feasibility plans may necessitate the sale of key players to secure top transfer targets. Barcelona have shown interest in Bayern Munich's Benjamin Pavard - another versatile French defender capable of playing at right-back and centre-back - and 90min understands they had considered offering them Kounde as part of a potential package. Chelsea, once managed by Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel, had previously Kounde for two years before his move to Barcelona last summer. Newcastle are also admirers of the defender. LISTEN NOW"
Eddie Howe confirms Newcastle's desire for 'marquee signings' as PIF make transfer plans,"May 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/eddie-howe-confirms-newcastle-desire-marquee-signings-pif-transfer-plans,"Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe has admitted he would be on board with bringing in 'marquee signings' this summer, and 90min understands the club's owners are planning to spend big in the transfer market. Howe has guided Newcastle into the Champions League in his first full season in charge, and despite a quarter of a billion pounds being spent since his arrival at the club in late 2021, he has long insisted they still need to be careful with how they use their money. 90min revealed earlier this month that the club's majority shareholders, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), were eager to spend lavishly. They are set to provide substantial funds and have their eyes on some major deals. Newcastle are due to announce some major sponsorships this summer which, coupled with European qualification, will enable them to rub shoulders in the transfer market with almost anyone in world football. Neymar is one of the players PIF have identified as a possible signing, as 90min recently reported, and not just because of his standing in the game but because Newcastle are in need of a left-sided attacker. Howe has now admitted that he would sanction signings in the ilk of Neymar and other superstars. Ahead of Newcastle's final game with Chelsea on Sunday, Howe was asked if his summer wish-list would include 'marquee' transfers. ""Yes,Â there would be players we'd love to bring in that would be classified in thatÂ bracket, I'm sure,"" he replied. ""For me, it's more about the role they can fulfil in the team - whether that'sÂ viewed positively or as a marquee signing, then great. ""I'm not in my mind thinking, 'We have to have one of those players that ticksÂ that box for the supporters'. As much as I'd love to do that, it's about findingÂ the right player in the right position who I think makes us better."" READ MORE FROM THE 90MIN TALKING TRANSFERS TEAM feed Howe added: ""Unfortunately players don't come cheap, especially good players. Yes, we are going to have to spend a certain amount of money. How much that is, I don't know. ""I still don't know what my budget is at this moment in time, but there will have to be some expenditure. It will have to be controlled. It will have to be under FFP restrictions, which we have worked under and will continue to work under. They are definitely impacting us and what we will be able to do."" Howe also insisted that despite enhancing his squad, he won't be jettisoning his current stars who have taken them into the top-four. ""Dan [Ashworth, director of football] has made the point to me about trading being an important part of our future. That does not necessarily mean selling your best players, but trading with FFP rules can be a good thing for your finances,"" he continued. ""The club will also be very keen to protect their assets and be ahead of the curve in terms of contract length and make sure weâre in a strong position, but also recognising players who have done well and rewarding them for their performances."" 90min understands that Newcastle are looking at bringing in up to six new players across various positions. A holding midfielder, right-sided centre-half, a left-back and two forwards are among the roles they are hoping to strengthen in.

Man City express interest in Joshua Kimmich,"May 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-city-express-interest-in-joshua-kimmich,"Manchester City are interested in signing Joshua Kimmich from Bayern Munich and are prepared to use Joao Cancelo as a makeweight in the deal, sources have told 90min. 90min reported last week that the midfielder was considering his future at the Allianz Arena and a number of elite European sides had been made aware that he may be looking for a new challenge. Kimmich's situation has now notably drawn the attention of Man City, who are in the market for a midfielder - prime target Jude Bellingham is set to join Real Madrid instead, while Bernardo Silva out-of-contract Ilkay Gundogan could leave the club this summer. 90min understands that Man City believe Kimmich, who has previously worked under Pep Guardiola, would be capable of slotting seamlessly into their midfield and they have outlined a deal which could see Cancelo join Bayern on a permanent transfer. The versatile full-back surprisingly left the Etihad Stadium for the Bundesliga at the back-end of the January transfer window, but struggled to initially make an impact under Julian Nagelsmann. However, since Thomas Tuchel became the new head coach, Cancelo has had more of a starring role and the 49-year-old wants to keep him in Bavaria. READ MORE FROM THE 90MIN TALKING TRANSFERS TEAM feed Bayern were drawn against Man City in the quarter-finals of this season's Champions League and Cancelo was roundly booed after coming off the bench at the Etihad. While Bayern's stance initially was to not even consider any approach for Kimmich, it remains to be seen whether Man City's strong interest will change their stance in any way. Man City have wrapped up the Premier League title and have their eyes on the treble, with rivals Man Utd to come in the FA Cup final before a showdown with Inter in the Champions League final.

Mason Mount: Summer transfer window destinations - ranked,"May 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/mason-mount-summer-transfer-window-destinations-ranked,"Mason Mount has been one of the most talked about footballers heading into the 2023 summer transfer window. With just one year left on his current contract, Mount has been linked with basically every single football you could possibly name.   Man Utd? Yep. Liverpool? Of course. Bayern Munich? Why the hell not! And while the rumour mill runs wild (brotha) we at 90min decided that it was as good a time as any to rank the England international's potential destinations this summer: manual Beating the other gigantic teams on this list to Mount's signature would be one hell of a coup for the nouveau riche Newcastle United.UEFA Champions League football could be a lure as it's something that his current club can't offer, but ultimately, this would still feel like a half-step back rather than any size of step forward.Maybe a few years time things will be different.Fit? 3/10 Fed up with not winning trophies for a few seasons, Mount? Well we've got the team for you! While a move to Bayern will guarantee winners' medals however, it possibly won't guarantee not game time. It's hard to imagine Mount displacing the quite brilliant Jamal Musiala in the FC Hollywood starting XI. Musiala is younger and, well, you know, better. Fit? 4/10 Mount is seemingly one of three midfield options for Man Utd this summer. The other two are Adrien Rabiot and Declan Rice. Rice fits Man Utd's needs for a box-to-box midfielder much more seamlessly, while Rabiot - amazingly - is in outrageously good form and currently looks like a better footballer than Mount. It's a weird world, it really is. Fit? 6/10  A move from Chelsea to Arsenal would be a rather controversial one to make. In a footballing sense, it does scan though. Arsenal are in need of an extra bit of athleticism in the middle of the park, and Mount would provide that in spades. He'd also provide some cover out wide for Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli when needed. If it didn't mean he'd be moving to a rival then Arsenal would perhaps be top of this list.Fit? 7/10  Despite all of the rumours, there is a world in which Mount stays at Chelsea. And in this world, Mount is playing under Mauricio Pochettino and all is probably gravy. Fit? 8/10  Sure, it'd be fun for Mount to work with Pochettino. But there's no doubt that working with Jurgen Klopp would improve Mount's game ten-fold. He fits a need at Liverpool too, who are in dire need of midfielders who are dynamic and good - neither of which they really have right now. Fit? 9/10 "

Edouard Mendy likely to leave Chelsea ahead of Kepa Arrizabalaga,"May 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/edouard-mendy-leave-chelsea-kepa-arrizabalaga,"Chelsea are looking to sell one of their two first-team goalkeepers, 90min understands, with Edouard Mendy currently the likeliest to leave this summer. 31-year-old Mendy, who joined Chelsea in 2020 and played a huge role in the team's Champions League triumph in his debut season, has been benched for the second half of the campaign in favour of Kepa Arrizabalaga. Both goalkeepers will enter the final two years of their contracts this summer and, as a result, Chelsea are open to offers for both Mendy and Kepa. Despite his recent string of starts, 90min understands that Chelsea would prefer to cash in on Kepa, who became the world's most expensive goalkeeper when he moved to Stamford Bridge for Â£71.6m in 2018, but his high wages have long complicated plans to get the Spaniard off the books. That salary is again expected to limit Kepa's options this summer and could push Mendy closer to the exit door, with the Senegal international's pay packet understood to be significantly lower. feed As a result, Mendy is seen as the easier goalkeeper to sell and it is hoped that the Champions League and Club World Cup winner will attract plenty of interest. Linked to these plans is Chelsea's desire to sign a new starting goalkeeper, and the Blues have voiced their interest in a number of potential options from across Europe. Inter's Andre Onana is a target for Chelsea, who would be prepared to offer either Mendy or Kepa to the Serie A side in an attempt to drive down his price tag, while Brighton's Robert Sanchez and Brentford's David Raya are being eyed and boast several years of Premier League experience. Porto's 23-year-old stopper Diogo Costa is also admired. Chelsea also have 19-year-old Gabriel Slonina on the books. The American international, signed from Chicago Fire last year, has impressed with the Under-21 side this season and is in line for a loan move for his first taste of senior football in Europe."

Ona Batlle agrees to join Barcelona,"May 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ona-batlle-agrees-to-join-barcelona,"Ona Batlle has agreed to join Barcelona when her Manchester United contract expires this summer, 90min understands. The Spaniard has become a fan favourite at United since joining the club in 2020 and has established herself as one of the best full-backs in the world during that time. Batlle was initially due to be out of contract at the end of last season, with the club choosing to trigger a 12-month extension. Talks over a new long-term deal had been ongoing for some time, but no agreement was reached, paving the way for a return home. The 23-year-old made her name as a player during spells with Madrid CFF and Levante, but she hails from the Catalan town of Vilassar del Mar and joined Barcelonaâs famed La Masia as a 12-year-old, eventually rising to Barcelona B, before starting her senior career elsewhere in 2017. Batlle has had a stunning season for United at both ends of the pitch. The way she completely shut down Lauren Hemp during last weekendâs victorious Manchester derby encapsulates her defensive supremacy, while her nine WSL assists indicate her enormous attacking importance â no other defender even comes close to that number, while only Chelsea winger Guro Reiten (10) has more. feed Batlle will join a Barcelona squad that already has Lucy Bronze. But the England right-back will be 32 in the autumn and only has one more year left on her contract. Batlle also has the versatility to operate as a left-back, which Barcelona have lacked since last summerâs Leila Ouahabi exit. Sweden winger Fridolina Rolfo has spent much of the current season in that role instead. As far as Manchester United are concerned, manager Marc Skinner insisted after the Manchester derby that the future success of the team wonât be dependent on individual players. Discussing both Batlle and Alessia Russo, who is also due to be out of contract next month but could yet stay, he commented: ""If they're here [next season] we'll be great and if they're not here, we'll [still] be great. That's the defiance of me and this club â one player won't make a Manchester United team. That's got to be clear if we want to win things."""
Angel Di Maria set to leave Juventus amid MLS and Saudi Arabia interest,"May 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/angel-di-maria-set-leave-juventus-mls-saudi-arabia-interest,"Angel Di Maria is set to leave Juventus as a free agent after just one season in Turin, 90min understands.  The Argentine World Cup winner signed a one-year deal at Juve last summer following the expiration of his deal at Paris Saint-Germain. Following a rocky start to life in Serie A, during which he was sent off in a defeat to Monza for violent conduct, Di Maria's form improved dramatically in the first few months of 2023.  Di Maria would prove to be pivotal in Juventus' run to the UEFA Europa League semi-final, scoring a hat trick against Nantes back in February and following that up with a winner against Freiburg the following month.  Since that goal however, Di Maria has gone 14 appearances without a single goal contribution and attracted the frustration of fans for his performances in Juve's semi-final clashes against Sevilla.  feed 90min now understands that contract talks between Di Maria's representatives and Juve over a new one-year extension have broken down, with the forward now set to leave the club.  Sources have confirmed that there is interest from MLS and Saudi Arabian clubs in the player's services as he becomes a free agent for a second consecutive summer.  Both Di Maria and the club itself are in agreement that the best course of action is to part ways at the end of the season. The 35-year-old has previously enjoyed lengthy spells at European giants Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain, winning the UEFA Champions League in 2014 with the former. "
Declan Rice not a priority target for Bayern Munich as Man Utd links resurface,"May 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/declan-rice-not-priority-target-bayern-munich-man-utd-transfer,"Bayern Munich hold an interest in signing West Ham captain Declan Rice but they are not actively regarding him as a top target, 90min understands. The Bavarian giants have been linked with a move for the 24-year-old in recent days, joining the ever-growing list of clubs interested in prising him away from London Stadium. Rice has attracted the attention of Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Newcastle thanks to his consistently outstanding performances for West Ham, and Manchester United remain interested as they consider bolstering Erik ten Hag's midfield options. West Ham know they face an uphill battle to keep Rice, who has two years remaining on his contract, but remain steadfast in their valuation. The Hammers believe Rice is worth at least Â£100m in today's market and sources have reaffirmed to 90min that the club have no intention of compromising on that figure â either it is met or a move will not happen. A fee of that size would comfortably smash Bayern's transfer record - Lucas Hernandez is their record purchase at just shy of Â£70m - and although the club, and head coach Thomas Tuchel, appreciate Rice's ability and believe that he could make a significant impact in both the Bundesliga and Champions League, 90min understands that a deal is not regarded as a priority at this stage. Bayern are instead looking to replace the guaranteed goals supply of Robert Lewandowski, who left last summer to join Barcelona after eight hugely successful seasons in Munich, despite the sudden uncertainty over the future of midfielder Joshua Kimmich. feed Tottenham striker Harry Kane remains Bayern's number one target and, like with Rice, a deal is affordable should the club wish to follow through their interest with a bid. Doing so may compromise their ability to facilitate other transfers, however, unless they are able to generate money through the sale of Sadio Mane - he will be allowed to leave the Allianz Arena if the price is right - and Lucas Hernandez, who has agreed personal terms with PSG. There's no guarantee that Kane or Rice would make the move to Germany. What Rice has done is publicly state his ambition to play in the Champions League and compete for trophies â the latter is something he could now do with West Ham as they prepare to contest the Europa Conference League final with Fiorentina â which has led to months and months of speculation about where he may end up. 90min understands that Arsenal are pushing hard for Rice and are confident that a deal can be agreed with West Ham. However, it's unclear whether or not they would be willing to match the Â£100m asking price, which may open the door for London rivals Chelsea â incoming manager Mauricio Pochettino is a huge fan and considers Rice to be an upgrade on a number of the club's current options. Manchester City are also lingering with intent as they are yet to tie down Ilkay Gundogan to a new contract, while uncertainty remains over the future of Barcelona and PSG target Bernardo Silva."
PSG agree personal terms with Manuel Ugarte & Lucas Hernandez,"May 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-agree-personal-terms-with-manuel-ugarte-lucas-hernandez,"Paris Saint-Germain have agreed personal terms with both Sporting CP's Manuel Ugarte and Bayern Munich's Lucas Hernandez as they look to step up their plans for the summer transfer window, 90min understands. Despite heading for another Ligue 1 title, PSG have endured a disappointing season by their standards. Coupe de France and UEFA Champions League campaigns both ended in abrupt defeats and so PSG officials are keen to improve their squad. Midfield reinforcements are high on PSG's wish list and contact has now been made with Sporting CP over a deal for in-demand Uruguay international Ugarte. Ugarte has plenty of interest from the Premier League but is also open to the idea of moving to the French giants and PSG have already voiced a willingness to meet his wage demands, with talks now on with Sporting over a transfer fee. The 22-year-old has a release clause of around â¬60m which 90min understands PSG are reluctant to pay up front, with talks now on over a deal which would see the French side pay in instalments instead. feed Also on PSG's radar is Bayern defender Lucas, who is approaching the final two years of his contract in Bavaria. An agreement over personal terms has also been reached with the 27-year-old, who is now evaluating all his options. Bayern are keen to keep Lucas but have already made it clear they will not match PSG's offer to the Frenchman. Should Lucas refuse to extend his stay in Germany, Bayern are prepared to sell this summer and PSG are ready to make an offer if the versatile defender hits the market. Bayern paid â¬80m to sign Lucas from Atletico Madrid in the summer of 2019, but injuries have prevented him from showcasing his best form. Lucas suffered a season-ending knee injury just 13 minutes into France's opening fixture of the 2022 FIFA World Cup and may well have played his final game for Bayern as a result."
Carlo Ancelotti confirms Real Madrid's first signing of the summer,"May 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/carlo-ancelotti-confirms-real-madrid-first-signing-summer,"Carlo Ancelotti has confirmed that full-back Fran Garcia will re-join Real Madrid from Rayo Vallecano this summer.  The 23-year-old came through the Real Madrid youth system and made one appearance for the Spanish giants during the 2018/19 season before being shipped out on loan to Rayo in 2020. After helping the club to La Liga promotion, Garcia signed permanently for the club and has impressed in the top flight ever since.  Following a season in which his side Rayo finished a respectable 11th in La Liga, the Spanish defender has now secured a move to his boyhood club Real Madrid.  feed Speaking to the press after Los Blancos' 2-1 victory over Rayo at the Santiago Bernabeu, Ancelotti confirmed the signing, revealing: âFran Garcia is a left-back who has a lot of energy. He is very fast with the ball, and he attacks very well.  ""He is a very good profile for Real Madrid, and next year he will be with us.â Along with Garcia, Madrid are also working extremely hard to finalise a deal to sign Jude Bellingham this summer.  90min reported earlier in May that the dynamic midfielder has agreed personal terms with Real Madrid ahead of a blockbuster move.  Real Madrid secured a last ditch win on Wednesday evening thanks to an 89th minute winner from Rodrygo Goes after Raul de Tomas cancelled out a first-half goal from Karim Benzema. The result sees Ancelotti's side rise up to second in the La Liga table thanks to Atletico Madrid's thrilling 3-3 draw with Espanyol."
Erik ten Hag confident of Man Utd transfer plans despite takeover uncertainty,"May 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/erik-ten-hag-confident-of-man-utd-transfer-plans-despite-takeover-uncertainty,"Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag is confident the Red Devils will be able to push ahead with their transfer business this summer, despite uncertainty over the ownership of the club. United's current owners, the Glazer family, have received significant bids from the likes of Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al-Thani and Sir Jim Ratcliffe - 90min understands the latter's offer is favoured - but there remains significant uncertainty over the entire process. Just whether the Glazers will remain at the club as part of any takeover is unclear, while the decision over a sale has dragged on for months and will now overlap with the summer transfer window, sparking fears that Ten Hag may not receive the financial backing he needs to bolster the team. However, the Dutchman is confident he will be able to push ahead with his plans for the squad this summer regardless of what is going on behind the scenes. ""Yeah, that's what I'm doing and that's our job,"" he told Sky Sports News when asked if he has been able to plan adequately for the summer amid all the uncertainty. feed ""This season that has to be our energy and the focus, but of course we are also planning for the future, for next season and that's what we have to do. And that is also talking with your scouting department, recruitment responsibilities, and talking with players of course."" Asked whether he was confident United could move for their top targets even if the Glazers remain at the club, Ten Hag added: ""I think so. I came in here [at the end of] last season and we talked about what can we do in the squad, what can we do in transfers. ""And last year, the club confirmed they can do. So, for me, I don't think anything changed and yeah, in this summer period we can do the same."" A new striker is high on Ten Hag's wish list. Tottenham's Harry Kane remains the top target, while Napoli's Victor Osimhen, Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic and Inter's Lautaro Martinez are all under consideration as well. 90min understands there are plans to sign more than one new forward. Ten Hag also wants a new centre-back and is keen on Napoli's Kim Min-jae, whose bargain release clause of anywhere between â¬40m and â¬60m has piqued the interest of a number of clubs across Europe."

West Ham undertaking thorough search for new director of football,"May 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-undertaking-thorough-search-new-director-football,"West Ham are working through an extensive shortlist as they seek to appoint a director of football to oversee their transfer business, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Hammers' dealings over the past year have largely been overseen by manager David Moyes and head of recruitment Rob Newman, with over Â£150m spent on new players last summer in a bid to continue building on the sixth and seventh place finishes earned during the 2020/21 and 2021/22 Premier League seasons. West Ham's 2022/23 campaign hasn't gone as planned from a domestic point of view - they sit 14th in the table and had been engrossed in the battle to beat relegation until a recent spate of wins - but progression to the Europa Conference League final has relieved some of the pressure on Moyes and the team overall. 90min understands majority owner David Sullivan has expressed his dissatisfaction over the club's performances this season, and in particular the impact of some of the club's more expensive signings. An appointment to take back an element of control over which players are targeted and signed by the club is being sought as a result. Roma sporting director Tiago Pinto is among the frontrunners for the director of football position - which will see Mark Noble transition into a slightly different role - while 90min understands Tim Steidten, formerly of Bayer Leverkusen, Brentford's Lee Dykes, Benfica's Rui Pedro Braz and Aston Villa's Johan Lange are also under consideration. The off-field uncertainty stretches to Moyes himself, with a decision yet to be made about his long-term future. 90min reported in March the Scot was unlikely to continue at the London Stadium even if the club end up winning the Europa Conference League, but that stance has softened in recent weeks with Premier League safety and a place in Prague now assured. Moyes hopes to at least see out the final year of his contract, 90min further understands, but is acutely aware the West Ham hierarchy do not want a repeat of this season's trials and tribulations. The Hammers have lost 19 Premier League games this season and have found it difficult to score goals â Said Benrahma is their top scorer in the league with just six."
Premier League confirms transfer window dates for 2023/24 season,"May 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/premier-league-confirms-transfer-window-dates-2023-24-season,"The Premier League has confirmed that clubs will be able to start recruiting new players from 14 June 2023 to kick off the summer transfer window ahead of next season. Although player contracts do not end until 30 June, which means any free agent signings will become official from 1 July, deals between clubs can be completed two weeks earlier that that. There are also different rules for domestic and international transfers, which may delay the latter until 1 July. The 20 top flight sides in England, which will feature Burnley, Sheffield United and one of Luton or Coventry, with the latter two contesting the Championship playoff final at the end of the month, will then be able to sign players for the next two and a half months. The summer transfer deadline will fall on at 11pm (BST) on 1 September. feed In previous seasons, the Premier League briefly decided to end its summer transfer window earlier than the rest of Europe. That hasn't been the case for the last few years after the short-sightedness of the plan was quickly exposed, and the league has confirmed that the new season's transfer window dates following talks with the EFL and league systems in Spain, Germany, Italy and France. The transfer deadlines in all of Europe's top five leagues will therefore close on the same day. In winter, the transfer window will open for business on 1 January 2024 and run for the whole of the month until it closes on 1 February at 11pm (GMT).

Erik ten Hag responds to rumours linking Neymar with Man Utd,"May 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/erik-ten-hag-responds-to-rumours-linking-neymar-with-man-utd,"Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag refused to answer a question regarding the speculation linking the Brazilian with a move to Old Trafford. A report from French publication L'Equipe this week claimed that United have opened talks with PSG and that Casemiro has been trying to persuade his international teammate to join him at United. Neymar joined PSG in a world record â¬222m transfer from Barcelona in 2017 when the French giants ambitiously triggered his buyout clause at Camp Nou. His current contract at Parc des Prince, which was signed in 2021, has another two years to run. 90min has previously reported that Manchester United have been among the clubs contacted by intermediaries to make them aware of Neymarâs potential availability. But Ten Hag chose to give a vague and general answer when asked for comment. ""When we have news, we will tell you,"" the Dutchman said. 90min reported just this week that United are being kept informed of Neymar's situation, but hold no active interest in the 31-year-old at this time. United are considering signing two central strikers this summer, which Neymar isn't, with Harry Kane, Victor Osimhen, Lautaro Martinez and Dusan Vlahovic among high profile primary considerations. The second would likely be a younger player to develop - Rasmus Hojlund, Santiago Gimenez and Goncalo Ramos. Benjamin Sesko and Mohammed Kudus have also been recommended by scouts. feed 90min first revealed last summer that the PSG hierarchy has been considering the possibility of letting the player go. Club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi also warned around that time that PSG are looking to change strategy: ""We don't want flashy, bling-bling anymore, it's the end of the glitter."" As such, intermediaries briefed Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea and nouveau riche Newcastle last summer about Neymarâs potential availability. However, PSG were still weighing up whether selling the Brazilian before the World Cup was the right move for them. 90min reported in February of this year that Neymar was again offered to a number of Premier League clubs by intermediaries, making Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Newcastle and Liverpool aware of the player's interest in moving to England and his potential availability. As of the start of May, 90min was able to reveal that Newcastle's majority owners, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, are interested in bringing Neymar to the Premier League. PIF had also shown interest in Cristiano Ronaldo until it was decided that the 38-year-old would not be the right fit for the current team that has been assembled. But Neymar could be, given Newcastle's need for a left-sided forward and a handful of other Brazilians already on Tyneside."
Napoli concerned by Kim Min-jae release clause amid Man Utd links,"May 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/napoli-concerned-by-kim-min-jae-release-clause-amid-man-utd-links,"NapoliÂ are desperately trying to convince Kim Min-jae to sign a new contract before a release clause in his current deal kicks in for the first two weeks in July, 90min understands. Sources close to the Italian champions have confirmed to 90min that there is a clause that exists in Kimâs deal that could see him leave in a specific window if a club meets a required fee. Manchester United have held talks over a possible deal, while other Premier League clubs hold interest. A fee to extract Kim from Napoli in early July will range between â¬40m and â¬60m, though the final figure is understood to be fluid and related to the buying club's turnover. Regardless of a final fee, it would still be far below the player's real market value - which has rocketed to around â¬100m. Napoli were essentially forced to include the exit clause in the deal to sign Kim last summer, and it was used as a tool to convince the South Korean to choose to move to Naples ahead of Ligue 1 club Rennes. He joined from Fenerbahce in July for just over â¬18m. feed The club have been trying to finalise a new deal with Kim since before the World Cup finals last year, but his agents have kept Napoli at an armâs length throughout this year. The player re-signing at Napoli can't be ruled out at this stage, but Kim's camp are aware of mounting interest in his services and are exploring their options. 90min can confirm that Manchester United have held talks about a possible deal and they are well positioned to make a move for Kim - who has never hidden his desire to one day play in the Premier League. Sources also confirm that United are not the only club courting Kim, and not the only one in England. Liverpool and Newcastle are both confirmed admirers of Kim, and both are in the market for central defenders this off season, whilst it is believed Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City are also ""aware"" of the situation and could yet become involved. Paris Saint-Germain are also in the mix, even with the summer arrival of Milan Skriniar, while Real Madrid and Barcelona are being kept informed of the situation too. Kim himself is set for military service in June, but come July he will make a decision on where he wants to play next season. It is looking increasingly likely it will be away from Naples."
Inter loanee Romelu Lukaku drops fresh hint about Chelsea future,"May 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/inter-romelu-lukaku-drops-fresh-hint-chelsea,"Romelu Lukaku has once again hinted at his desire to remain at Inter beyond the current expiration of his loan deal from Chelsea. The Belgian forward joined Inter during the 2022 summer transfer window following an extremely disappointing season at Chelsea. Lukaku managed a measly eight Premier League goals for the club after being signed for a whopping Â£97.5m.  The 30-year-old's form has picked up in recent weeks for Inter after initially struggling upon his return to San Siro. He has bagged six goals and contributed four assists in his last eight appearances, with the club's form leading to a first appearance in the Champions League final since 2010. 90min revealed in April that Lukaku had made it known that staying at Inter was his priority, and speaking to Het Laatste Nieuws, he reiterated his feeling of belonging to the Serie A giants. ""I was good at Chelsea last season. But I knew then that if it didnât work out at Chelsea, I still had Inter,"" Lukaku said. ""When I signed again, I knew: I belong here. I had that too at Anderlecht. I take this club seriously. I want to do my best. The people here see that. Being encouraged here is the best thing there is."" feed Lukaku's comments back up what Inter CEO Giuseppe Marotta recently told Radio Rai, saying that he believes the player is 'very comfortable' at San Siro but that his future depends what Chelsea want to do. ""Romelu loves the shirt he wears, he is very comfortable at Inter. These are fundamental aspects, this desire of his to be with us,"" Marotta remarked. ""But he is on loan until June 30. He will return toÂ Chelsea, and we don't know what will happen on a technical level at that club. At the moment we are at the window."" Lukaku previously scored 64 goals in 95 appearances for Inter to earn his big-money move to Stamford Bridge. He formed a dynamic partnership with Lautaro Martinez up front - which continues to flourish to this day - and previously enjoyed a hugely successful spell with Everton in the Premier League. A two-season stay at Manchester United between 2017 and 2019 was regarded as a failure by many, though he still scored 42 goals in 96 appearances in red - 27 of those coming in his first season at Old Trafford."
Mason Mount set for meeting with Chelsea hierarchy amid Man Utd links,"May 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/mason-mount-set-for-meeting-chelsea-hierarchy-man-utd-links,"Mason Mount is set for a meeting with Chelsea's hierarchy next week regarding his future at the club, 90min understands. The 24-year-old midfielder is entering the final 12 months of his current deal at Stamford Bridge, and the club have been embroiled in lengthy discussions with the player regarding a contract extensions. The delay in a new deal being agreed upon has sparked interest from Liverpool, and 90min also understands that Arsenal have registered their interest with Mount's representatives. Manchester United has also been thrown into the mix regarding a potential Â£55m bid for Mount, while sources have stated that Newcastle United, who secured UEFA Champions League qualification on Monday, are keeping an eye on how negotiations are panning out. Chelsea's imminent appointment of Mauricio Pochettino has led to new confidence at the Blues that Mount will indeed rebuke interest from elsewhere to sign a new long-term deal. In light of Pochettino's proposed hiring, 90min recently reported that the club had planned to accelerate talks with Mount's representatives, and they will sit down with the midfielder next week. feed Pochettino is believed to be a huge fan of Mount and wants him to be a part of his Chelsea project moving forward. The England international has struggled with form and fitness this season as the Blues have woefully underperformed under three different managers. In just 20 Premier League starts, the midfielder has managed a measly three goals and two assists. Prior to this season's woes, however, Mount was one of Chelsea's most consistent performers, winning the club's player of the year award in 2020/21 and 2021/22."

However, reports from Spain on Tuesday revealed that Kounde has grown increasingly frustrated with being played at right-back as opposed to his natural centre-back and will look to engineer an exit from Camp Nou. 90min understands that Barcelona are surprised with this development and are not impressed with Kounde. Barca's financial woes and need to meet La Liga's feasibility plans means they may need to sell key players in order to bring in top transfer targets. Kounde was not someone thought to have been on the chopping block but his sudden change of heart could change the club's stance. Barcelona director Mateu Alemany was asked about Kounde's future on Tuesday evening, but insisted that the club will 'resolve internal situations internally'. feed Kounde is on huge wages at Barcelona and they would demand a fee of roughly â¬80m, which could make him hard to shift despite his intentions to find a new club. Barcelona are known admirers of Bayern Munich's Benjamin Pavard - another French defender comfortable at right-back and centre-back - and there have been suggestions they could try and package a deal that would send Kounde to Bavaria in return. 90min reported last week that Barcelona are also among a list of elite European clubs that have been alerted to the possible availability of Bayern midfielder Joshua Kimmich. Kounde was courted by Chelsea - then manged by current Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel - for two years prior to last summer's move to Catalonia. Newcastle have also shown an interest in Kounde in the not too distant past."

"Arsenal, Man City & PSG among sides interested in Zenit winger Malcom","May 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-man-city-psg-among-sides-interested-zenit-winger-malcom,"Zenit Saint Petersburg forward Malcom is attracting plenty of interest across Europe ahead of a potential transfer this summer, 90min understands. Malcom, formerly of Bordeaux and Barcelona, has enjoyed a sensational campaign out on the right side of Zenit's attack, racking up 23 goals and nine assists from just 27 top-flight outings this season. The 26-year-old is understood to believe he is ready for a return to one of Europe's top leagues and sources have confirmed to 90min that his agents have spoken with Zenit to try and engineer a move away this summer. Those same representatives have reached out to a number of sides from across Europe to try and find suitors for Malcom, and it is understood that plenty of teams have voiced an interest in getting a deal done. Indeed, 90min understands that Arsenal, Manchester City and Newcastle have all been alerted to Malcom's potential availability, while Paris Saint-Germain are also known admirers after failing to get a deal over the line in the January transfer window. feed Zenit are well aware of the interest in Malcom but, given he signed a new deal last summer to tie himself to the Russian side until 2027, they are prepared to demand a significant fee for his services. Sources have told 90min that Zenit are set to demand upwards of the Â£40m with which they parted to sign Malcom from Barcelona in 2019. The Russian side are also braced for potential approaches for another Brazilian, 19-year-old defender Robert Renan. Renan, who only joined Zenit in January, has long been tracked by teams across Europe. Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Newcastle and Tottenham are all known admirers of the centre-back, who was handed a maiden call-up to the Brazil national team back in March."
Man Utd exploring signing two centre forwards this summer,"May 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-exploring-signing-two-centre-forwards-this-summer,"Manchester United are considering signing two new centre forwards in the summer to address their long-standing issues in front of goal, 90min understands. United are one point from confirming their qualification for next season's Champions League and can rubber stamp their return to the competition by avoiding defeat at home to Chelsea on Thursday night, in their penultimate league game of the season. Fulham visit Old Trafford on Sunday before United's showdown with Manchester City in the FA Cup final on June 3. Notably, Erik ten Hag's side have only managed 52 goals in the league over 36 games - the second lowest total in the top half of the table. Ten Hag has often criticised his team's inability to kill matches off while leading, and United followed a similar trend in their 1-0 win over Bournemouth last weekend. The Dutchman is keen for United to address the problem over the summer and as 90min has reported, Tottenham talisman Harry Kane is the club's top transfer target. Despite Kane's 28 league goals this season, Spurs have endured a miserable season which will see them finish between seventh and ninth in the table - and likely out of Europe altogether. Kane has one year left on his deal with Spurs and United sense a better opportunity than ever before to finally sign one of their most-wanted players from the past decade. It's understood that there is not huge confidence at United that they will be able to secure a deal for Kane with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy, who has garnered a reputation for being a tough negotiator even dating back to the days where United signed Michael Carrick and Dimitar Berbatov from the north London club. Tottenham want a minimum of Â£100m for Kane and while United will explore if they can pull off the move, 90min understands they will be prepared to move on to other targets should Spurs drag their heels. Tottenham run the risk of losing Kane for free in a year's time should they be unable to convince Kane to extend his contract, so Kane is in a more powerful position than at any time before. READ MORE FROM THE 90MIN TALKING TRANSFERS TEAM feed Ten Hag wants United to secure their targets as early as possible in the summer, ideally in time for their pre-season tour of the US and certainly before the Premier League resumes in August. The uncertainty over the club's ownership situation complicates the matter further but United have already identified their targets - it will soon be about making advances. Any fee for Kane would likely break United's transfer record, and while the club also hold interest in Napoli's Victor Osimhen, his price is understood to be a significant stumbling block. There are fears in the club that a deal for the Nigerian could reach Â£130m - a near Â£40m increase on their current transfer record, and such an outlay would limit their options to strengthen in other areas. Both Kane and Osimhen are in a first ""box"" of targets which comprises of ready-made options to fill the central striking void, with Inter's Lautaro Martinez and Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic also considered. 90min reported in January of United's early interest in the Serbian, who could be the most attainable of the four at present, despite Juventus' public statement that the player is not for sale. United have been following Vlahovic since before his move to Turin, which hasn't gone to plan for the 23-year-old, and there is growing confidence that he would like to join - there are certainly indications from the player's camp that he would like to move to England. Those within United aren't deterred by the difficult spell at Juventus and have confidence that a coach like Ten Hag could, as he has done with a number of players at United to date, bring the best out of the player. Vlahovic's price would likely sit in the Â£70m-Â£80m range and allow United room for manoeuvre with other options, and while central midfield is a high priority position to strengthen, United would like there to be room in the budget to put towards a second centre forward from a second ""box"" of younger options. Evan Ferguson is liked by United but recently signed a new deal with Brighton and looks unattainable this year, while Rasmus Hojlund, Santiago Gimenez and Goncalo Ramos are among other promising striking prospects who could integrate into the squad in the long term. Benjamin Sesko and Mohammed Kudus also come recommended by club scouts. Kudus in particular finds himself in an interesting situation, having already worked with Ten Hag at Ajax, while he can play in a number of positions - from both the right side and at number 10 as well as through the middle. The Ghanaian would offer United valuable versatility, which they lack in both the central and right sided positions in attack. The player's agent recently stated that this summer is the ""right time"" for Kudus and Ajax to part ways, while he has also rejected the option to extend his deal through 2026. Ajax may be more willing sellers to United or any other interested party, such as Newcastle United, this summer compared to last, given they are unlikely at best to qualify for next season's Champions League. ""I think it is best for both Ajax and Mohammed that he makes a transfer now. Now is the right time,"" said Kudus' agent, Jennifer Mendelewitsch, to De Telegraaf.  ""He has ignored a proposal to extend his contract until the summer of 2026. What I can say is that after the World Cup and this season there is a lot of interest in Kudus."" Kudus' price is likely to fall in the Â£30m-Â£40m range and would represent a valuable, versatile outlet that Ten Hag is familiar with, who could also fit into the shape of the squad alongside a more established name to take the burden of scoring the goals.  He would also represent a younger alternative to Neymar, who United have been linked with this week in France. It's understood by 90min that United are being kept informed on the Brazilian's future developments - as is commonplace for leading clubs and high profile players - but there is no active interest on United's end. United see their attack as the primary area to fix before next season, as Wout Weghorst's loan will end in early June and Anthony Martial, who signed for United eight years ago, is a player United are actively looking to sell. The Frenchman has struggled for the duration of the season with injuries and Ten Hag has internally indicated his willingness to part with the player."
Middlesbrough braced for Premier League interest in Hayden Hackney,"May 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/middlesbrough-braced-premier-league-interest-hayden-hackney,"Middlesbroughâs Hayden Hackney is being watched by some of the Premier Leagueâs biggest clubs after a hugely impressive campaign at The Riverside Stadium, 90min understands. The 20-year-old, who previously enjoyed a loan stint at Scunthorpe, has quickly become of Michael Carrick's most trusted performers after graduating from the club's youth academy, earning a regular place in midfield. Hackney signed a new long-term deal with Middlesbrough in December, but 90min understands that he could be rewarded with another contract such has been his progress. However, with the club failing to earn promotion to the Premier League after losing their two-legged play-off semi-final with Coventry, it does mean that a large offer could see him sold. Boro are not in a position financially to reject reasonable offers for their big names - they no longer receive financial assistance in the form of parachute payments - and it's expected that they will have to sell this summer to buy. Chuba Akpom, the club's leading goalscorer during 2022/23 with 28 Championship goals, is set to leave in a big money deal this summer, but Boro are fearful that Hackneyâs form could attract some of the Premier Leagueâs top clubs. feed 90min understands that Arsenal and Liverpool have both checked on the 20-year-old, while local rivals Newcastle, as well as Nottingham Forest and Leicester City, have also taken an interest in his recent performances. Hackney's international future is also the subject of contention, with England ready to take on Scotland this summer in a bid to commit him to the Three Lions. Having played for England at Under-15 level, Hackney - who qualifies for Scotland via his mother - was called up to their Under-21 squad in November and played. However, sources have told 90min that England want Hackney back in their fold and are ready to hand him a call-up to their Under-21 squad this summer - leaving the Teessider with a big decision to make."

Several clubs in France, Italy and Germany remain interested as well, namely Lille, Eintracht Frankfurt and Napoli. No official offers have yet been made to Feyenoord, however. Gimenez adjusted quickly to the Dutch Eredivisie after arriving ahead of the 2022/23 campaign, scoring 23 goals so far this season in all competitions. But it's his recent form - 11 goals in his last 10 appearances and scoring in eight consecutive Eredivisie away games - that has attracted interest from across Europe.

""He's an important player for us, he is not for sale, we are not interested,"" Te Kloese said.

Xavi reveals Barcelona's main transfer priority for summer window,"May 22, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/xavi-reveals-barcelona-main-transfer-priority-for-summer-window,"Barcelona manager Xavi has revealed that a midfielder is the club's top priority for the summer transfer window.  Contrary to the expectations of many fans, who believed Barcelona would prioritise a right-back signing to address the ongoing positional issue, Xavi has revealed that their primary concern lies in bolstering the midfield. This decision stems from the imminent departure of the club's long-serving captain Sergio Busquets, who will bid farewell to Barcelona after an illustrious 15-year tenure. Jules Kounde has been filling in at right-back for a significant portion of the season, highlighting the pressing need for reinforcement in that position. However, Xavi's focus remains steadfast on revitalising the midfield unit, recognising the impact of Busquets' imminent departure on the team dynamics. ""Busi is leaving, and we need a high-level defensive midfielder. An important, differential footballer is leaving us. And we have to replace him. The more we strengthen ourselves, weâll be more competitive,"" Xavi told reporters.  The Barcelona manager also addressed recent criticism from Real Sociedad's sporting director, Robert Fernandez, who condemned Xavi for discussing midfielder Martin Zubimendi.  âThe Real Sociedad sporting director was angry because I talked about Zubimendi, but it is you who ask me about him. I donât want to destabilise any other teams."" Real Sociedad boss Imanol Alguacil has recently relayed his confidence that Zubimendi will not leave the club in the summer, saying: ""I know what Zubimendi thinks and wants. I have no doubt he wants to play in the Champions League with us next year. Zubimendi has a contract with us, itâs the best place he can be, and he wants to be with us.â Xavi was also asked about Joshua Kimmich as a target for Barcelona this summer, and he said: ""Kimmich is spectacular in my opinion, one of the best in his position.â"

Vinicius has established himself as one of the most dynamic attackers in the world over the past couple of years. He scored 22 goals in all competitions for Real last season, earning him a 2022 Ballon d'Or nomination, and has eclipsed that with 23 this season.

Vinicius has openly criticised La Liga's response to the various incidents this season and has claimed in the wake of the Valencia game that 'racism is normal' within the competition.

They are firmly backing Vinicius and are determined to fight La Liga or anyone else to get justice for him. Vinicius himself is not seeking to leave and remains happy at Real. His relationship with coach Carlo Ancelotti, who is under contract until at least the end of next season is also a main reason why the player is keen to continue in the Spanish capital. Ancelotti has helped Vinicius unlock his potential since returning to the club in 2021, overseeing the player's transformation from talented youngster to decisive game-changer."

""Yes, I know [why], but I don't talk about the process. Let the process go,"" Ten Hag replied. ""Once again, this is not important at the moment for me or Rashy.

Back in December 2022 ahead of Everton's 1-1 draw at Manchester City, Lampard said: ""[Haaland] is an amazing player and the ultimate top level players generally can do what he does in a top level league. ""I coached against him in a pre-season game when he was playing for Salzburg. I tried to sign him for Chelsea and it was not to be. ""It was clear in our pre-match preparation what this boy was.

I know the Chelsea side is another story. I tried to sign him when I was last here. I was really keen to get him here but it couldn't happen. ""His level was really clear at that point as well.

Raphinha drops biggest hint yet about future at Barcelona,"May 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/raphinha-drops-biggest-hint-yet-about-future-barcelona,"Barcelona winger Raphinha has again signalled his intention to remain at Camp Nou amid strong speculation linking a return to the Premier League. The 26-year-old joined the Catalan giants last summer in a deal worth up to Â£55m, having played a starring role for Leeds United for two seasons. The tricky Brazilian initially struggled to find form at Barca, as he failed to command a regular starting spot under Xavi, but has now tallied up 14 goal contributions in 32 La Liga appearances - a combination of seven goals and seven assists. Raphinha signed a five-year contract upon his arrival in Catalonia but his future at the club has already been called into question. 90min understands that Arsenal hold a strong interest in taking him back to England, while they are also interested in signing team-mate Ferran Torres. Newcastle and Chelsea have also been linked with moves - the latter came close to signing Raphinha before he put pen to paper with Barcelona - and the impending return of Lionel Messi from Paris Saint-Germain is likely to have an adverse effect on his playing time. Amid the ongoing speculation, Raphinha recently hit out at an 'uninformed and unprofessional' report that suggested he'd already agreed to move on this summer, and while celebrating the club's 27th La Liga title success, he again reiterated his desire to stay at Barca and continue winning trophies. feed ""I hope to be able to come back one more time,"" Raphinha told Barca TV (via Mundo Deportivo) aboard the club's open-top bus parade, before adding: ""...we worked hard for this, we knew what we wanted and to crown the League with this rÃºa is spectacular. It's better than I imagined. ""I would ask people to continue supporting us that next season we are going to try something more and go for the maximum titles that we can get"". Whether or not Barcelona could afford to turn down a bid for Raphinha remains to be seen. The club need to dramatically cut their wage bill if a fairytale return for Messi is to materialise, and they currently can't even afford to register the new contract of teenage sensation Gavi. As a result, 90min understands that offers for Raphinha, Torres and Ansu Fati will be considered, with Ousmane Dembele another who would be allowed to leave if a suitable offer came in."

We drive home, Tuesday is a day off - not for him but for the others - and then Wednesday he will be in team training, that is my information. ""We have to see. The Saturday game is a super difficult game for plenty of reasons.

The 28-year-old has been one of the better performers in Serie A throughout the 2022/23 season, putting in vastly-improved showings for a Juventus side who are now up to second in the table after three successive wins. Rabiot has bagged 11 goals in all competitions for La Vecchia Signora, after failing to score a single goal last season, and has also contributed four assists - form that has played him into contention for a new contract with his current deal up at the end of June. Negotiations have been ongoing with Rabiot's representatives about prolonging his stay at the Allianz Stadium and manager Massimiliano Allegri is understood to be a huge fan of the Frenchman. Notably, Rabiot himself is thought to he happy in Turin and is enjoying his time at the club. Nevertheless, the fact that talks with Rabiot's camp are yet to lead to an agreement has stoked the fire over a potential transfer away from the club. feed 90min revealed in March that Manchester United, Liverpool and Tottenham were keeping tabs on Rabiot's situation and they, alongside Arsenal, are continuing to monitor developments. The quartet believe that signing a player of Rabiot's calibre would represent excellent transfer business - United manager Erik ten Hag is also a known admirer - and would be willing to pounce if Juventus are unable to agree terms over a new deal. Rabiot opened the door to a move in December last year when he said that he'd be interested in moving to the Premier League, but more recently suggested that he could end up staying at Juventus, whom he joined from Paris Saint-Germain in 2019. Indeed, Rabiot opting to move to a different league could adversely affect his chances of getting into France's squad for the 2024 Euros, given the need to acclimatise to the pace and style of English football."

While they continue to push for a contract extension for N'Golo Kante, there are doubts over the futures of Mateo Kovacic, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Conor Gallagher and it is understood that strengthening in midfield is a key part of Pochettino's vision for the Blues. West Ham are prepared to part ways with Rice but are well aware of his value in the Premier League and would look for a fee of at least Â£100m to sell the midfielder, who still has two years remaining on his contract and would command an enormous fee even if he remains at the London Stadium for a further 12 months. feed Competition is also fierce for Rice, with the majority of the Premier League's elite all sensing an opportunity to lure the England international away this summer. Arsenal have emerged as a leading suitor and Rice is understood to be interested in a move to the Emirates, but there is also interest from Manchester City, Manchester United and Newcastle.

Barcelona must lower their wage bill before they can make any further signings, and they have submitted a feasibility plan to La Liga in an attempt to prove their ability to get back under the salary cap.

Chelsea to step up Mason Mount contract talks after Mauricio Pochettino agreement,"May 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-mason-mount-contract-talks-mauricio-pochettino-agreement,"Chelsea are planning to accelerate talks with midfielder Mason Mount over a new contract following their imminent hiring of Mauricio Pochettino as new manager, 90min understands. A full agreement has been reached with the former Tottenham boss, who will fly into London and put pen to paper on a contract in the coming days with a view to taking over from Frank Lampard at the end of the season. With that pressing order of business now all but finalised, Chelsea's focus will once again turn to the future of Mount. The 24-year-old is approaching the last 12 months of his contract and has previously rejected the offer of an extension, leading to warnings from Blues officials that he will be sold this summer if he does not change his stance. 90min revealed in April that Chelsea were confident that the imminent arrival of Pochettino would impress Mount and boost their chances of reaching an agreement over fresh terms, and sources have confirmed that their optimism remains. Pochettino is understood to be a huge fan of Mount and has made it abundantly clear to Chelsea that he wants to see a new contract handed to the academy graduate, and the Blues are ready for a fresh round of negotiations in the coming weeks. feed Mount has held positive, informal talks with Chelsea, including co-owner Todd Boehly, in recent weeks, which has boosted the club's hopes that an extension will soon be agreed. Should Mount continue to reject the offers on the table, he will have no shortage of suitors. Liverpool have long been keen on the 24-year-old while 90min can confirm that Arsenal have registered their interest with Mount's representatives. The Gunners are prepared to step up their pursuit of the midfielder in the coming weeks if Mount does decide to leave Chelsea, who are readying another push to try and prevent that from happening. Mount has struggled with injury in recent months and, should he opt to leave Stamford Bridge, may have already played his final game for the club as he battles to return from a minor operation on his pelvis. Interim boss Lampard has already confirmed Mount 'might' miss the final few weeks of the season, and ahead of this weekend's 2-2 draw with Nottingham Forest he confessed it would be a 'tight call' over whether the midfielder will be fit again before the end of the campaign."

How Barcelona could line up in 2023/24,"May 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/how-barcelona-could-line-up-in-2023-24,"Joan Laporta can be a loquacious character but Barcelona's president was blunt when he outlined the club's goals before Christmas. ""We've made it crystal clear to everyone in the dressing room that our all-important objective is to win the league,"" the elected official declared. Xavi Hernandez has lived up to his president's ambitions in his first full season in charge of the club he captained to such success. However, while the La Liga table looks mightily healthy with a double-digit gap to Real Madrid, the figures on Barcelona's balance sheet are nowhere near as attractive. Naturally, with Laporta at the helm, the goals for the transfer window will be characteristically aspirational. Based on the grounding of 90min's expert transfer assessment, here's a look at how Barcelona could line up for the 2023/24 campaign. GK: Marc-Andre ter Stegen - With more La Liga clean sheets in one season than any other Barcelona goalkeeper in the history of the Spanish top flight, Ter Stegen's place is safe for another year. RB: Jules Kounde - If Barcelona still had all the levers available to them, there may be an upgrade at right-back. Yet, with La Liga furtively pouring over every decimal point, what funds Barcelona can conjure up will likely be used elsewhere. CB: Ronald Araujo - Seemingly the only La Liga defender that can consistently muzzle Real Madrid's Vinicius Junior, the admiration between Xavi and Araujo is mutual. CB: Andreas Christensen - Without hogging the plaudits of other teammates, Christensen has been subtly superb at the heart of the best defence not only in Spain but across Europe's top five leagues during his debut season. LB: Alejandro Balde - The fleet-footed Masia graduate will still be a teenager by the start of the 2023/24 campaign. Nevertheless, as Jordi Alba's role continues to dwindle, Balde is set to cement his spot haring up and down the left flank. CM: Bernardo Silva - Here is where things start to get interesting. Bernardo has seemingly had one foot out of the Etihad for the last three years only for Pep Guardiola to cajole him into one more season but Barcelona, as dominant La Liga champions (don't look at their European record) are attractive suitors. City are thought to want as much as Â£75m for the 28-year-old under contract until 2025. CM: Ilkay Gundogan - Barcelona will not have to loosen the purse strings for Gundogan's transfer fee as the Manchester City captain's contract runs out this summer. 90min understands that the Catalans are close to finalising a deal for a cerebral midfielder to fill the void vacated by the departing Sergio Busquets. CM: Pedri - When detailing the importance of the slender midfielder, Xavi once gushed: âPedri gives us a lot of tranquillity. He makes every ball that goes through his feet better. Iâm just calmer when he has the ball, itâs that simple."" There is no way he is going anywhere. RW: Lionel Messi - Two years after Messi sobbed his way out of Camp Nou - which was just 12 months after sending a burofax demanding his sale - Barcelona are ""leaving no stone unturned"" in their bid to resign the club's all-time top scorer. It may take an unprecedented scale of financial fiddling - even for Barcelona - but they are supposedly desperate, or keen to look as desperate as possible, to bring Messi home. ST: Robert Lewandowski - Despite a post-World Cup lull, Lewandowski's debut season in La Liga can be viewed as an overall success. Barcelona's leading scorer is on course to become the first player since Ruud van Nistelrooy in 2007 to finish as the most prolific player in Spain after his first campaign in the country. LW: Gavi - The muddled shirt number history which has played out on the back of Gavi's jerseys this season underpins the complex nature of the teenager's contractual situation. Given La Liga's strict salary limits, Gavi will technically become a free agent this summer until Barcelona can shed the excess expenditure on the balance sheet. The season may be over but Barcelona have plenty of work still to do."
Southampton players Premier League teams should sign after relegation,"May 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/southampton-players-premier-league-teams-should-sign-after-relegation,"After an 11-year stay in the top flight, Southampton were relegated after a defeat to Fulham on Saturday. It's been a disastrous season for the Saints and a season in which the club looked doomed for relegation since the very first game - a 4-1 defeat at Tottenham. Despite their poor performances, there is a surprising amount of quality on the books at St. Mary's Stadium at the moment. Here's the pick of the bunch and which Premier League clubs should snap them up in the summer. feed Clubs that should be interested: Aston Villa, Tottenham HotspurThe Saints' captain, for his set pieces alone, would be a valuable addition to any Premier League club. And when you add in the fact that he's quite a good player in open play too, Ward-Prowse could be a clever signing for a team eyeing up a top six finish next season.  Clubs that should be interested: Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United, Tottenham HotspurPerhaps the standout talent on Southampton's books, 19-year-old Romeo Lavia has everything it takes to become a genuinely world class midfielder. The youngster should be set for a move to one of the better teams in the Premier League during the summer.  Clubs that should be interested: West Ham, Fulham, Crystal PalaceSouthampton's -35 goal difference and their 66 goals conceded in 36 games may deter quite a few clubs from looking at the defenders on the books at St. Mary's, but in doing so some clubs will be overlooking a very talented young centre-back. Bella-Kotchap largely struggled during the 2022/23 season as the leader of the Southampton backline, but alongside a veteran centre-back at another club we could see a much, much improved player. At just 21 years old, he's worth taking a punt on this summer. "

Barcelona's transfer options as fairytale Lionel Messi return nears,"May 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-transfer-options-fairytale-lionel-messi-return-nears,"Barcelona's transfer window could be full of thrills, spills and unmissable drama, with Lionel Messi's potential blockbuster return setting the news agenda across the world. The 35-year-old has been in Paris for a couple of years trying to fire PSG to glory in the Champions League, but alongside Kylian Mbappe and Neymar, he has failed to match the expectations of the club's board and supporters. A third optional year will not be taken up in Messi's contract, opening the possibility of a dream return to Barcelona, or a potential money-spinning jaunt to Saudi Arabia - a country the World Cup winner has links to already in an ambassadorial capacity. Messi's homecoming would inevitably be the marquee signing for Barcelona as they prepare to build on this season's La Liga title success, but there's other irons in the fire as Xavi bids to return BarÃ§a to Europe's top table. Personal terms have already been agreed with Athletic Club's Inigo Martinez, with the central defender out of contract at the end of the season and able to join on a free transfer, and there's a number of other players being linked with the arrivals lounge at Camp Nou. Here's 90min's spin through of how things stand. Age: 35Club: Paris Saint-Germain The one transfer Barcelona are looking to get over the line above all others is that of Lionel Messi - bringing the all-time great back to the club after a two-year stint at PSG. Whether or not BarÃ§a can afford to do so is another story, but the club are leaving 'no stone unturned' in their bid to make it happen. Saudi Arabian moneybags Al Hilal have their own aspiration of signing Messi - they are hoping a â¬400m-a-year contract and the fact he's an ambassador for the club's tourism board will swing the pendulum in their favour - but all signs point towards a return to Catalonia. Crucially, confidence is growing that Barcelona will be able to facilitate Messi's return in some way and the club hope to announce a deal soon. Age: 32Club: Manchester City Ilkay Gundogan represents a real opportunity for Barcelona to add a winner to their ranks, owing to his success at Manchester City. Under Pep Guardiola, Gundogan has got used to winning just about everything, and has one eye on ending the club's wait for a first ever Champions League success. Now 32, he remains one of the first names on the teamsheet, particularly for big games. Gundogan's experience could be a perfect guide for emerging stars Pedri and Gavi, while giving BarÃ§a a great chance to make their own mark on next season's Champions League. In terms of a deal materialising, there's high hopes in Catalonia. Age: 28Club: Manchester City Cash flow is still not great at Barcelona but they can't take their eyes off Gundogan's Manchester City team-mate, and creative maestro, Bernardo Silva. The 28-year-old has made noises about wanting to test himself away from the Etihad and there's every chance that BarÃ§a may look to test the soon-to-be (if they keep winning every game) Premier League champions' resolve with a cheeky summer bid. To be successful though, BarÃ§a may need to somehow stump up as much as Â£75m. Age: 28Club: Manchester City The third piece of a Manchester City target trio, Barcelona are also looking at a deal for full-back Joao Cancelo, currently on loan at Bayern Munich. The Portuguese has established himself as one of the world's best full-backs in recent years, capable of playing on both flanks and tucking into midfield to provide additional support in central areas. But a rumoured falling out with Pep Guardiola saw Cancelo head for Munich in January, with the Bundesliga giants also having a â¬70m option to buy. That amount is regarded as a little steep, meaning a permanent switch is not guaranteed, and BarÃ§a, along with Arsenal, are monitoring the situation. In the case of the Catalan giants, a loan is the preferred option. Age: 33Club: Chelsea Barcelona are pretty well stocked in the forward department but there's been murmurings of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang returning to the club on a free transfer. The Gabonese international left Camp Nou to reunite with former manager Thomas Tuchel at Chelsea, but the German was axed a week after Aubameyang arrived on deadline day last summer. He's barely had a look in since and the Blues are willing to cut ties and get a number of players off their books. By no means a priority signing, Aubameyang could at least offer up another free transfer option for BarÃ§a, and he's certainly interested in returning. Age: 18Club: Athletico Paranaense There's plenty of buzz in Brazil around teenage sensational Vitor Roque - the latest in a long line of wonderkid forwards destined to make it big in Europe. A far better fit for Barcelona than Aubameyang if long-term plans are factored into the equation, 18-year-old Roque is known to be ready for a move. One stumbling block is Athletico Paranaense having the power to demand â¬60m for the teenager as that's his release clause, and they're likely to hold out for a fee close to that because of significant levels of interest from the Premier League. Barcelona are considered to be at the front of the queue for Roque, who has already played up front for Brazil's senior side, so it's now a question of how far will the club's finances stretch this summer. feed Age: 23Linked clubs: Arsenal, Aston Villa It's been less than three years since Ferran Torres traded Valencia for Manchester City, signing a five-year contract to lead Pep Guardiola's side into the future. The Spaniard didn't manage to showcase what he could do at the Etihad but that didn't stop Barcelona from forking out a wedge of money to lure Torres back to Spain at the end of 2021. Some 15 months later, he could be on the move again. Although highly-rated by Xavi, Barcelona need to raise funds this summer through player sales and reduced wages, making Torres' position at the club vulnerable. He's not first choice and is a long-term target for Mikel Arteta's Arsenal - Aston Villa are also keen after improving under Unai Emery. Age: 26Linked clubs: Newcastle, Chelsea, Arsenal âThis is a lie and whoever said that is a liar, uninformed and unprofessional,â Raphinha recently said when informed of media reports that he'd agreed to allow Barcelona to listen to offers. But despite the Brazilian's desire to stay at Camp Nou, the decision may be taken out of his hands if Barcelona want to push through a return move for Messi. The two play in the same position and it's unlikely he'll have much sway over a player widely regarded to be the best of all time. Arsenal and Newcastle like Raphinha, as do Chelsea, but it's unclear whether or not he's seen as a preferred target at any of the trio. Age: 20Linked clubs: Wolves, West Ham Ansu Fati was once tipped to be the future of Barcelona, even taking on the club's famous number ten shirt after Lionel Messi's departure. But injuries have hampered the young Spaniard's progress and he has been usurped in Xavi's pecking order by a number of other talented players. Indeed, just 11 of his 31 La Liga appearances so far in 2022/23 have been as a starter. 90min understands that Fati has been told he can move on, but moves to Wolves and West Ham, two interested parties, are unlikely to appeal to a player who once had Manchester United, Arsenal or Chelsea on his coat-tails.  Age: 25Linked clubs: PSG, Bayern Munich, Newcastle The fourth winger Barcelona are prepared to sanction an exit for, should the terms be right, is Ousmane Dembele - a player they committed to spending â¬144m on when negotiating with Borussia Dortmund. It's fair to say Dembele has struggled to live up to that billing - any player would unless they are regularly competing for Ballon d'Or wins - amid a catalogue of injury problems. Those have cleared up this season, for the most part, allowing Dembele to find some form under Xavi on both wings. The Frenchman's future has been up in the air for years and his latest suitors, Newcastle, could firm up their interest should Champions League qualification be secured. There's talk of Barcelona wanting to give Dembele a new contract - Xavi is a huge fan - but the situation could change in a heartbeat depending on financial need."
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer reveals Man Utd turned down Erling Haaland deal,"May 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ole-gunnar-solskjaer-man-utd-turned-down-erling-haaland-deal,"Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has insisted that he tried to persuade Manchester United to sign Erling Haaland as a teenager, only for his pleas to be ignored. Solskjaer oversaw Haaland's development during their respective spell at Molde between 2017 and 2018 before the former rejoined Man Utd, firstly as caretaker manager before receiving the job on a permanent basis. Speaking to an audience at the Mercure ManchesterÂ PiccadillyÂ Hotel on Friday evening, Solskjaer revealed that he tried to persuade United to take on the then up-and-coming Haaland when Jose Mourinho was manager. ""I got in contact with United because we had this talented striker who they should have had,"" Solskjaer said. ""But they didn't listen, unfortunately. Four million, I asked for. But they never signed him. Four million! Donât ask [where he is now]. Heâs too good."" Read the latest Man Utd news here feed United did make an attempt to sign Haaland from Red Bull Salzburg in January 2020 when Solskjaer was at the helm, but the striker instead chose to join Borussia Dortmund. He would go on to score a whopping 86 goals in 89 games across two-and-a-half seasons for BVB before completing a Â£51.2m move to Manchester City last summer, following in the footsteps of his father Alf-Inge. Haaland has already broken the record for most Premier League goals scored in a single campaign, finding the net 35 times in his debut campaign. City are also on the cusp of winning the treble. They lead the Premier League by a point from Arsenal but with a game in hand, face Real Madrid in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final on Wednesday and take on Man Utd in the FA Cup final in June."
David Moyes admits Declan Rice likely to leave West Ham this summer,"May 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/david-moyes-declan-rice-likely-to-leave-west-ham-this-summer,"West Ham manager David Moyes has conceded for the first time that Declan Rice is likely to leave the club this summer. The Scot, who led West Ham to a 2-1 win over AZ Alkmaar in the first leg of their Europa Conference League semi-final clash on Thursday, has always maintained that the club are not looking to sell their best players, despite ongoing speculation about Rice's future. Moyes has even said that interested parties will need to part ways with at least Â£100m to have any chance of luring Rice away from London Stadium - he'll have two years remaining on his contract at the end of the season. 90min has extensively reported on interest in Rice over recent months. Manchester City are among those considering a move this summer, as they plan for life after Ilkay Gundogan and Bernardo Silva, while Arsenal are also a potential landing spot for the England midfielder. Chelsea and Manchester United also hold an interest in Rice, as do Liverpool - they are looking to sign three midfielders this summer but are leaning towards making Brighton's Alexis Mac Allister their first acquisition. feed West Ham could qualify for next season's Europa League if they are able to beat AZ and then Fiorentina or Basel in the Conference League final, but even that achievement is unlikely to match Rice's ambitions. He has previously stated that he wants to play in the Champions League to test himself against the best players in the world. The Hammers have known for a while that cashing in on Rice may be their only option, and Moyes has admitted publicly that his time at the club may be drawing to an end. ""We honestly hope he stays,"" Moyes said. ""We'd love for him to be a West Ham player but we are aware that might not be the case at the end of the season. So that's one of the scenarios around planning. There are plans that we have Dec here but we're also fully aware there is a good chance we won't have him."" He continued: ""The planning has been on the back burner. It's always been about making sure you're a Premier League club. Your planning will go completely if you weren't. A lot of it will only start to go into place once we've realised we have kept our Premier League place. ""We're watching a lot of players, a lot of games, doing a lot of scouting, but truth is the focus has been on staying in the Premier League. We brought in a big number of players last summer so I see this summer more as tinkering and bits and pieces being done here and there. I see a change here or there and an addition or two."" Rice was outstanding in West Ham's most recent Premier League win - a 1-0 success over Manchester United - and those three points look to have secured the club's place in the top flight barring a dramatic late turn of events."
'Quality players want to come' - Erik ten Hag drops huge Man Utd transfer hint,"May 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/erik-ten-hag-drops-huge-man-utd-transfer-hint,"Erik ten Hag has insisted that the quality of player that Manchester United can sign has increased over the past year. The Red Devils have largely enjoyed a successful first year under the Dutchman, notably ending their six-year wait for a trophy by winning the Carabao Cup. Though qualification back to the Champions League looked safe a month ago, a poor run of results means that United could yet be dragged back into a battle for a top-four spot. Nevertheless, Ten Hag is adamant that the club's summer transfer business will not hinge on which European competition they are in next season and claimed that they can now sign better players than before. Read the latest Man Utd news here feed ""I see a big difference in comparison with last year,"" he said at a press conference on Friday. ""There were a lot of reservations last year when I spoke with players and now many players see the project, what's going on, the dynamic and the ambition in this project, the quality especially. ""They are really keen to come, I've noticed that. It looks like there were a lot of reservations last year, a lot of doubts when we approached players. This year, many quality players really want to come."" Man Utd made five key additions to their squad during Ten Hag's first transfer window, bring in Lisandro Martinez, Christian Eriksen, Casemiro, Tyrell Malacia and Antony. They then added Wout Weghorst, Jack Butland and Marcel Sabitzer on loan in January. Man Utd are gearing up for a busy summer in the transfer market. While David de Gea is closing in on a new contract, 90min understands they have been keeping watchful eyes over Porto's Diogo Costa and Brentford's David Raya this season, while young goalkeeper Matej Kovar could challenge him for the starting spot too. The Red Devils have also kept tabs on Milan defender Fikayo Tomori, as well as Monaco's Axel Disasi. Further up the pitch, Man Utd have considered bolstering their midfield options, with Bayern Munich's Ryan Gravenberch and Chelsea's Mateo Kovacic among their targets. Signing a new striker is among Man Utd's top priorities, with Tottenham's Harry Kane and Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic among a raft players on their shortlist."

Xhaka came close to a Bundesliga return in January 2020 when Hertha Berlin made an offer to Arsenal two months after the midfielder was stripped of the captain's armband. However, he was persuaded to stay and fight for his place by the incoming Mikel Arteta. Since then, Xhaka has embarked on a redemption arc that could yet end in Premier League glory, establishing himself as a dependable figure in the heart of midfield during the Gunners' title challenge this season. Arsenal remain a point behind Manchester City in the standings, though the reigning champions also have a game in hand. LISTEN NOW"
Jurgen Klopp reveals what lack of Champions League football would mean for Liverpool transfer plans,"May 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jurgen-klopp-champions-league-football-liverpool-transfer-plans,"Jurgen Klopp has insisted that failure to qualify for the 2023/24 UEFA Champions League will not hinder Liverpool in the summer transfer window.  The Reds currently sit in fifth place in the Premier League, just one point adrift of Manchester United having playing a game more than their arch rivals.  A few months ago Liverpool had seemingly no hope of qualifying for Europe's elite competition having started the 2022/23 season surprisingly poorly. Results have picked recently, however, with Liverpool winning their last five Premier League games on the bounce - results which have pushed them into top four contention.  Regardless of whether or not Liverpool catch fourth place United, Klopp has insisted in his latest pre-match press conference that the club's transfer plans will not be affected. âAt the moment, when you talk [to a player], you realise that heâs already clarified because we canât tell anybody that we will be definitely in Champions League next year,' the German said. feed âSo if heâs talking to us then itâs probably already clear that he knows about that situation. Itâs obvious that we have to fight for being part of the Champions League and to fight for trophies. And if you want to be part of that, youâre more than welcome. Itâs only one thing which we canât guarantee this year and this is Champions League football. âAll the rest is the same like it was before. Itâs a fantastic club with a really, really good football team and an even better one hopefully next year. So thatâs it, and thatâs not so difficult. Iâve barely faced the situation that you are in talks with the player and everything sounds great in the end, he says âok, now, see you if that happensâ. âWeâre still Liverpool and that means we are really attractive for a lot of players and we should not forget that. Thatâs why Iâm not concerned about that fact. âEverything is more difficult without Champions League, thatâs how it is. Especially in the long term; we should not do these kind of things more often. Apart from that, itâs absolutely ok the situation we are in, from a talking point of view and from a convincing point of view.â Liverpool have recently been linked with a number of players ahead of the summer transfer window, with 90min reporting that the club are keen to get a deal for Alexis Mac Allister over the line by the end of May.  The Reds have also sent scouts to check out Lens stars Kevin Danso and Seko Fofana, Eredivisie duo Jurrien Timber and Ibrahim Sangare, and Atalanta's Teun Koopmeiners."
Barcelona confident of announcing Lionel Messi return soon,"May 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-confident-of-announcing-lionel-messi-return-soon,"Barcelona are 'hugely confident' they will be in a position to announce the return of Lionel Messi soon, sources have told 90min. The 35-year-old is at the centre of a tug of war between former employers Barca and Saudi Arabian outfit Al Hilal, with his two-year stay at Paris Saint-Germain guaranteed to come to an end this summer. Al Hilal are confident they can persuade Messi to move to Saudi Arabia - he recently made an unauthorised trip to the country as part of his duties as an ambassador for the tourism board - but the player is believed to prefer a return to Catalonia, where he spent the first 21 years of his career after moving from his native Argentina. Messi's representatives, including his father, Jorge, have received a contract offer from Al Hilal estimated to be worth â¬400m-a-year, which would make him the highest paid footballer of all time. Barcelona won't be able to match that financial package but are doing all they can to clear the financial decks and make space for Messi on their wage bill - he only left the club in 2021 because La Liga would not authorise his new contract due to the club's financial plight. President Joan Laporta is confident the club will be able to balance the numbers and sources have reiterated to 90min that Barcelona believe they will be in a position to announce Messi's return soon. manual One piece of the jigsaw was slotted into place earlier this week when veteran midfielder Sergio Busquets confirmed he will depart Camp Nou at the end of the season, after winning 32 major honours with his boyhood club en route to making over 700 appearances. Busquets was one of Barcelona's highest earners, with his imminent departure prompting La Liga  president, Javier Tebas, to tell COPE of Messi's potential return: âBusquetsâs departure is the beginning of the road for Messi to return. âBut to reach the end, they still have to walk many meters. Iâm not the one to give them the green light, it will be their economic control.â 90min understands that Barcelona are prepared to listen to offers for young winger Ansu Fati, while they will also consider bids for Ousmane Dembele, Raphinha and Ferran Torres - players who all earn a significant wage at the club and may see their minutes marginalised by Messi's return. Others are likely to leave as well to allow Barcelona to pursue other long-term targets, including Manchester City duo Ilkay Gundogan, who is available this summer on a free transfer, and Bernardo Silva."
Jude Bellingham agrees personal terms with Real Madrid,"May 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jude-bellingham-agrees-personal-terms-with-real-madrid,"Jude Bellingham has agreed personal terms with Real Madrid and informed Borussia Dortmund of his decision to leave the club this summer earlier this month, 90min understands. Bellingham is one of the most wanted players in world football at present and has been courted by the likes of Manchester City and Liverpool for a number of months, as well as Los Blancos, with all parties anticipating a potential move for the England international in 2023. The 19-year-old's representatives have spoken to each of the main contenders while Dortmund themselves had their own pitch for Bellingham to extend his contract with the club before moving at a later date. However, Bellingham informed Real of his decision to join them at the start of May via Juni Calafat, the club's chief scout and driving force behind the signings of Fede Valverde, Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo Goes. Dortmund were later informed by Bellingham's representatives that he would not be extending his deal with them, and that the player instead wanted to push through the transfer to Spain. City were also told of Bellingham's choice - with no bad blood between the parties, Bellingham's decision has been taken as a matter of preference and career mapping. manual Bellingham's team have been in talks with Real over the last week to finalise terms and they are now agreed, with the initial deal set to run for six years. A release clause of â¬1bn has also been set for when the contract is signed. With the player's wishes now clear, the onus is on Madrid to reach a deal with Dortmund. They are set to speak this month to reach an agreement that suits all parties, though Dortmund have maintained throughout the process that they are looking to reach a deal worth a total value of â¬150m - a club record sale that would surpass the sum Barcelona paid for Ousmane Dembele in 2017. There is no release clause set in Bellingham's current contract, meaning the structure of the transfer is open to negotiation for both clubs. Initial talks, 90min has learned, have been centred around payment structure and how much will be paid up front. Real are aware of the size of the deal required and are prepared to be flexible in order to get it over the line - with the teams not far aware from finalising."

Man Utd consider promoting loan star to challenge David de Gea,"May 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-consider-promoting-loan-star-challenge-david-de-gea,"Manchester United will hand a new contract to David de Gea, but his competition to be the starting goalkeeper next season could come from within the club. United have De Gea as number one with veteran Tom Heaton in reserve alongside Jack Butland, who arrived on loan from Crystal Palace in January after Martin Dubravka returned to Newcastle. United are in the market for other goalkeepers and have been assessing their options, including the likes of Swiss veteran Yann Sommer, who is expected to leave Bayern Munich this summer, and Anderlecht's young Dutch keeper Bart Verbruggen. They have also looked at Porto's Diogo Costa and Brentford's David Raya, but with De Gea's extension in the offing it remains to be seen if they will spend big on a new goalkeeper. That's where Matej Kovar comes into the equation. feed Sources have told 90min the 22-year-old is under consideration for a place in the first-team next season after emerging as one of the best young keepers in Europe. Kovar has been with United since 2018 after joining from FC Slovacko. He has never played for United's first team but was involved in the Champions League squad under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He has tasted first-team football during loan stints at Swindon, Burton and now Sparta Prague. Kovar has enjoyed a brilliant campaign in his homeland with Sparta, who are top of the Czech First League table and hoping to claim a first title in nine years. 90min understands United have been keeping close tabs on Kovar, particularly in recent months, and the reports on his progress have been glowing. It is now believed United's goalkeeping staff think Kovar can push to become De Gea's understudy at Old Trafford. Of the current reserves, Butland is set to leave and has held talks with Scottish giants Rangers, while Heaton - whose contract expires this summer - could remain for another season."
Barcelona target plays down talk of summer transfer,"May 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-target-plays-down-talk-summer-transfer,"Real Sociedad midfielder Martin Zubimendi has ruled out leaving the club this summer, having been linked with Barcelona as a potential replacement for departing captain Sergio Busquets. San Sebastian local Zubimendi has spent half his life at La Real, joining the clubâs youth setup aged 12 in 2011. He progressed through the various age groups and has been a first-team regular since 2020. Zubimendi has consistently played Europa League football in recent years and has earned plaudits for his role helping La Real challenge for a top four finish this season to return to the Champions League for the first time in almost a decade â they have a seven-point cushion on fifth place Villarreal with only five games left to play. With Busquetsâ impending exit from Camp Nou suspected for some time but finally confirmed this week, reports in Spain have already picked out Zubimendi as a like for like replacement. But the 24-year-old, whose contract at Anoeta runs until 2027, doesnât appear keen. âI have never said anything about wanting to leave La Real,â he told Radio Marca Donostia. âI do nothing but see news of that and it makes me feel uneasy. I have neither listened nor wanted to do anything. I do not know if I have been able to leave, but I have not even considered it. I have already said it several times, to say it more times it seems that they do not listen to me.â feed Barcelonaâs main transfer ambition for the summer is re-sign Lionel Messi, who is set to leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of his contract next month. Sources have previously confirmed to 90min that the club is âleaving no stone unturnedâ in their efforts to strike a deal that will comply with La Liga financial regulations. In that regard, La Liga president Javier Tebas has already warned that Barcelona must âtake many financial measuresâ. Tebas said last month: âToday, I don't see his signing as feasible. But thereâs a lot of time left, Barca can still make moves to get Leo. We are still awaiting a feasibility plan from Barcelona. They need a big effort to make it happen.â Barcelona have been confident for some time, although there is rival interest from Saudi Arabia, for whom Messi is a tourism ambassador, and confidence from club Al Hilal that a deal will be struck. In addition to Messi, the Catalans are keen on Manchester City captain Ilkay Gundogan and remain confident the German will join on a free transfer when his contract in England soon expires. Another Manchester City player that Barcelona have had longstanding interest in is Bernardo Silva. That interest is reciprocated but, as 90min has reported, City will only sell if an offer meets what they deem to be the Portugal internationalâs market value - Â£75m (â¬86m). Aymeric Laporte is a third City player on the radar in the Camp Nou offices but, again, finances are proving to be a hurdle, while they would enter the race to sign out of favour full-back Joao Cancelo if a transfer could be arranged as an initial loan."
Manuel Ugarteâs agent claims move is imminent amid Liverpool links,"May 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/manuel-ugarte-agent-claims-move-imminent-amid-liverpool-links,"The agent of Sporting CP midfielder Manuel Ugarte hopes his client's future will be 'resolved in 15 days' amid interest from Liverpool and a number of other Premier League clubs. The Uruguay international has enjoyed a stellar couple of seasons in the Portuguese capital following his 2021 move from Famalicao, notably playing a starring role in Sporting's triumphs against north London rivals Arsenal and Tottenham in European competition this term, and his performances have not gone unnoticed. 90min understands that a number of Premier League sides have shown an appreciation of Ugarte, including Liverpool, who have him on their shortlist of midfielders and are one of the clubs most keen on a deal. Aston Villa are also fond of Ugarte, while Newcastle, West Ham and Wolves have watched him in recent times. But despite there being a widespread liking for Ugarte and his abilities, sources have told 90min that interested parties value him at around Â£30m - a figure roughly Â£20m short of his current release clause. Nevertheless, Ugarte's agent, Jorge Chijane, has told Portuguese outlet O Jogo that the 22-year-old will likely leave Sporting this summer and that Jorge Mendes will help broker a deal - he even hopes a resolution will be found over the next couple of weeks. feed ""It is almost certain that he will leave,"" Chijane said. ""I'll be in Lisbon soon. I trust Jorge Mendes, who is the best businessman in the world. In fact, when I told him about Ugarte for the first time, he said: 'Your eyes are my eyes'. ""There is a lot of talk, but they are not the only club, there are others,"" he continued when asked directly about Liverpool's interest. ""There's a lot of talk, but I'm still not sure about the club [Ugarte will join]. There are many hypotheses on the table. I believe that in 15 days the situation will be resolved."" 90min further understands that Tottenham, who have watched plenty of Sporting games over the past 12 months -  they signed Pedro Porro in January and remain interested in Pedro Goncalves - do like Ugarte but he is not believed to be anywhere near the top of their list of summer transfer targets. Arsenal have also sent scouts to watch Ugarte in previous months but they have cooled their interest and are focusing on other targets."
Pep Guardiola passionately appeals for Lionel Messi's 'impossible' Barcelona return,"May 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/pep-guardiola-passionately-appeals-lionel-messi-impossible-barcelona-return,"Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has revealed that he believes Lionel Messi ""will do the impossible"" to return to former side Barcelona. Messi's career as we know it took off under Guardiola at Camp Nou, becoming a perennial Ballon d'Or winner and announcing himself as one of the best players of all time even early in his career. The Argentina forward had to leave Barca in the summer of 2021 as La Liga's strict financial restrictions meant they could not register his new contract. He signed for PSG on an initial two-year deal later that transfer window.

""Leo helped our club [Barcelona] become much greater than when he arrived. When a person is so big, you have to say goodbye in the right way. He left because of very difficult financial circumstances, for thousands of reasons that I'm not going to get into. ""I hope the day comes when I'm in my seat [at Camp Nou] and I can stand up and applaud, and say goodbye to Leo as he deserves.

"Arsenal, Bayern Munich & Barcelona interested in Joao Cancelo signing","May 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-bayern-munich-barcelona-interested-joao-cancelo-signing,"Joao Cancelo is unlikely to be reintegrated into the Manchester City first team next season, with several of Europe's top sides interested in taking him off their hands, sources have told 90min. The Portugal international was surprisingly sent on loan to Bayern Munich for the second half of the 2022/23 season, and City fans booed Cancelo when he came on as a substitute during Bayern's Champions League quarter-final defeat at the Etihad Stadium in April. 28-year-old Cancelo initially struggled to nail down a place under Julian Nagelsmann but has since become more of a regular with Thomas Tuchel at the helm. Bayern retain a â¬70m option to buy Cancelo once his loan expires this summer but they have publicly insisted this price is too steep. 90min understands that the German champions would like to keep hold of the versatile full-back, however. In addition to Bayern, other major clubs across the continent are interested in Cancelo. Barcelona have been monitoring his situation and it's understood they would enter the race for his signature if they could sign him on an initial loan first. feed Arsenal are also keen on Cancelo. Mikel Arteta briefly worked with him during their respective times at Manchester City and the Spaniard believes that he could slot nicely into the Gunners' current tactical setup. Real Madrid are also in the market for a right-back with their options thin beyond the veteran Dani Carvajal, and Cancelo's camp have been exploring the Santiago Bernabeu as a possible landing spot. Cancelo arrived at City in 2019 on a long-term contract, joining from Juventus in a deal that sent Danilo the other way. He became the most expensive right-back in history in the process, but initially struggled to dislodge Kyle Walker from the side and played a bit-part role. He showed his versatility to eventually command a regular spot at left-back, shuffling between the two positions as helped City win back-to-back Premier League titles in 2020/21 and 2021/22."

Gareth Bale's agent responds to ongoing Wrexham links,"May 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/gareth-bale-agent-responds-ongoing-wrexham-links-ryan-reynolds-rob-mcelhenney,"Gareth Bale will not be coming out of retirement to join the Hollywood revolution at Wrexham, despite the pleas of Red Dragons co-owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney. Wrexhamâs journey has become global news over the last couple of years, with Reynolds and McElhenney completing their takeover in 2020 and putting the historic Welsh football club firmly in the spotlight. They have invested heavily and recently saw the team return to the EFL for the first time in 15 years by winning the National League title. The club reaped the rewards of tempting goalkeeper Ben Foster out of retirement in the closing stages of the campaign and there are already big plans for the 2023/24 season ahead in League Two. McElhenney, who found fame in the long-running cult TV show Itâs Always Sunny in Philadelphia, first propositioned Bale on Twitter: âHey Gareth Bale, letâs play golf, where I totally wonât spend four hours trying to convince you to un-retire for one last magical season.â Bale later joked, âI think I was looking more for a free round of golf off Rob.â The Wrexham pair later denied it was a joke on their part, with McElhenney going on to tell Welsh broadcaster S4C: âI think thereâs seriousness from our side, but I donât know that thereâs seriousness from his. I think heâs happy.â manual But Reynolds appeared to hint there was still hope when he said: âI like that we can kind of do some stuff thatâs a little outside the box of convention when it comes to goofing around. I didnât think Ben Foster would be coming over and he did.â McElhenney also seems to be refusing to take no for an answer, calling on Bale just this week during an appearance on The Aarthi and Sriram Show to give it âone last yearâ. Speaking to Sky Sports, Baleâs long-standing agent, Jonathan Barnett, has now quashed the idea that the 33-year-old former Real Madrid star has any desire to be back on a football pitch. âHeâs flattered by the offers, but theyâre all tongue-in-cheek,â Barnett said. âHeâs having a great life at the moment and [itâs] well deserved â heâs been the best British football, probably ever. Heâs now having a well-deserved rest and weâll see how things go. âThey havenât actually spoken to me, theyâve only spoken to Gareth. But Gareth doesnât want to play football anymore. Heâs had a great career, enjoyed himself, but heâs having a great life with his family, which is the most important thing, and spending a lot of time with his children and thatâs what he wants to do. Heâll do other things later down the line, but at the moment, let him just enjoy himself."
Is Jude Bellingham joining Real Madrid?,"May 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/is-jude-bellingham-joining-real-madrid,"Jude Bellingham's future was poised to be the sub-plot of the summer, but the proactivity of a particular member of Europe's elite likely means there will be little time for a saga to develop. A whole host of clubs were said to be interested in acquiring the England international at the end of the 2022/23 season, but Borussia Dortmund's hefty price tag forced several clubs, including Liverpool, out of the running. Instead of putting all of their eggs in the Bellingham basket, the Reds are now primed to take a more Moneyball-esque approach to rebuilding and reshaping their midfield. Real Madrid and Man City, however, are two clubs that seemingly haven't been deterred by the midfielder's price tag and it's the Spanish giants who have taken considerable strides to securing the signing of the youngster. Real Madrid are leading the race to sign Bellingham, with many believing the current European champions are the midfielder's preferred destination this summer.  90min reported that the meeting between Bellingham's father and Real Madrid chief scout Juni Calafat was hugely positive and the player is close to reaching a deal with the Spanish behemoths. Real, however, are yet to strike a deal with the German club. While it's unclear how much it'll cost to convince Dortmund to sell, it's almost certain that Bellingham will garner a fee close to â¬150m (Â£130.4m). Negotiations are said to be in their final stages and the impending contract extensions of Toni Kroos and Luka Modric will not have any impact on the potential deal. Real regard Bellingham as their present and future.  Err...absolutely! While Dortmund are fully aware that it'll be hard to keep the teenager on their books for next season, they are giving it a go - hence why they're demanding a club-record fee for his sale this summer.  Bellingham's current deal expires in 2025, but Dortmund are willing to offer him a bumper new deal in a bid to convince him to stay. Reports suggest BVB have offered the midfielder a fresh salary of â¬14m, but that offer pales in comparison to Real's supposed â¬20m offering.  After dazzling for three seasons in the Bundesliga, the time now seems right for Bellingham to move on. City are certainly still in the hunt, but they've got to move right now if they're to have any chance of snatching Bellingham away from Real Madrid. The back-to-back Premier League champions hold an interest in the midfielder, but they're yet to send any sort of offer to Dortmund or Bellingham.  Some thought the England international would be an excellent replacement for Ilkay Gundogan, whose contract expires in the summer, but his recent form will surely convince the club to negotiate a new deal. manual Liverpool's midfield is in dire need of a refresh and Bellingham appeared to be the ultimate solution to the Reds' woes.  The Merseyside club certainly boasted an interest in the box-to-box midfielder before pulling out of the race in April. Bellingham long appeared to be the answer to their problems, with club legends like Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher doing their bit in the media to get the England international to Anfield."
Raphinha hits out at reports of Barcelona exit,"May 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/raphinha-hits-out-at-reports-of-barcelona-exit,"Barcelona winger Raphinha has denied that he has given his blessing for the club to start welcoming offers for him in the upcoming summer transfer window. Raphinha joined Barcelona from Leeds last summer in a deal worth up to Â£55m. The Brazilian had a mixed start to the season, finding himself in and out of the starting XI and struggling for goals and assists. But he has hit his stride since 2022 became 2023, managing nine direct goal contributions in his last 16 La Liga games, compared to only four in his first 15. However, Barcelonaâs ongoing financial trouble will make player sales necessary again to raise capital ahead of next season, especially with ambitions to re-sign Lionel Messi. In that regard, Ansu Fati has already been told he can leave, as reported by 90min. There is likely to be no shortage of interest in Raphinha. Arsenal wanted the 26-year-old last summer when he was in the process of leaving Leeds and even made contact with Barcelona over both him and Ferran Torres in January after missing out to Chelsea on Mykhailo Mudryk. The interest from north London in both players still stands, with 90min reporting only last week that Arsenal remain determined to sign a right winger as part of a targeted wider recruitment drive ahead of returning to the Champions League next season for the first time in six years. feed Raphinha and Torres each feature on a list of Gunners targets, as does Bayer Leverkusenâs Moussa Diaby. Soon to be free agent Wilfried Zaha is also a secondary option at this stage. But Raphinha has responded angrily to a post by Fanaticos Por Futebol on Instagram that claimed he has said âOKâ to Barcelona listening to offers. The post specifically referenced Chelsea and Newcastle and appeared to have twisted a report originally published by SPORT. âThis is a lie and whoever said that is a liar, uninformed and unprofessional,â he directly replied. Raphinhaâs determination to stay at Barcelona is understandable. As 90min reported last July, he was holding out for a transfer to Camp Nou at a time when Chelsea had already agreed a fee with Leeds. The Blues were tellingly unable to agree personal terms, given that the player and agent, Deco, the former Porto, Barcelona and Chelsea star, were both angling for a switch to Catalonia instead."
Rafael Leao agrees terms over new Milan contract,"May 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/rafael-leao-agrees-terms-new-milan-contract,"Rafael Leao has agreed terms over a new long-term contract with AC Milan, sources have told 90min. The Portugal forward's deal was due to expire at the end of the 2023/24 season and talks between the two parties have long been ongoing over a fresh one. And 90min understands Leao has now agreed a new five-year contract at San Siro, with the player's representatives informing interested parties of the decision. Chelsea had long courted Leao and have spent lavishly in the Todd Boehly era, while Manchester City had been keeping a watchful eye on his contract negotiations with Milan. There had been an ongoing legal case between previous clubs Lille and Sporting CP over an unpaid transfer bill from the former to the latter, but this has since been sorted. feed Milan have not removed Leao's â¬150m release clause from this new contract. Leao has announced himself as one of the world's premier forwards in recent years, firing Milan to their first Scudetto in over a decade last season. He won Serie A's MVP award for his stellar performances. Though Milan have fallen short in their Serie A title defence this term, Leao has been the shining light in their run to the Champions League semi-finals. His crowning moment came in their quarter-final second leg at Napoli, teeing up Olivier Giroud's tie-clinching goal with an enthralling solo run."
Oliver Kahn reveals how close Bayern Munich came to signing Erling Haaland,"May 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/oliver-kahn-how-close-bayern-munich-came-to-signing-erling-haaland,"Bayern Munich CEO Oliver Kahn has revealed the club ""tried everything"" to sign Erling Haaland during the 2022 summer transfer window.  FC Hollywood were one of a number of clubs who held talks with the superstar striker while he was on the books at Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund - where he scored a quite ridiculous 86 goals in 89 games in all competitions in two-and-a-half seasons.  Haaland would eventually sign for Manchester City for a fee of around Â£55m, with Bayern opting to sign Sadio Mane as their replacement for Robert Lewandowski. While Mane has struggled for form in Bavaria, Haaland has thrived in Lancashire, breaking the all-time single Premier League season goalscoring record. The 22-year-old has 35 strikes to his name and also scored crucial goals to knock Bayern out of the Champions League at the quarter-final stage. Speaking about Haaland to BILD Sport, CEO Kahn has now revealed the lengths Bayern went to in order to try and push through a move before coming up short. ""We tried everything for Erling Haaland one year ago and went to our financial limits,"" the former goalkeeper said. ""We had to decide: do we want to break our wage structure? We werenât ready for that. Thatâs not Bayern-like."" feed In light of Haaland's move to Manchester and Mane's indifferent form in Munich, 90min understands that Bayern are already prepared to listen to offers for the latter - the Senegalese international has played second fiddle to Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting in recent weeks - and are pursuing a move for Eintracht Frankfurt's Randal Kolo Muani. Talks have been held with the Frenchman's representatives about a potential move to Bayern, though Frankfurt's CEO Axel Hallmann recently suggested that a bid of at least â¬90m would be needed for a deal to be agreed. âKolo Muani? When I look at the international market, I imagine a different number than â¬90m - more than this,"" he said. ""He has a long-term deal. My absolutely ideal scenario would be that he stays with Eintracht."" The 24-year-old has scored 13 Bundesliga goals and 21 in all competitions after joining from Nantes on a free transfer last summer."

At the age of 34, Busquets has remained one of BarÃ§a's most dependable players and they can wrap up a first La Liga title at city rivals Espanyol this weekend. But this trophy will be the midfielder's last for the club, with Barcelona announcing on Wednesday morning that Busquets will leave this summer. ""It has been an honour, a draw and a source of pride to have been able to wear this badge but everything must come to an end,"" Busquets told club channels.

Busquets has racked up 719 appearances for Barcelona, a tally that is only bettered by former teammates Lionel Messi and Xavi. Should BarÃ§a win La Liga, he will have won a staggering 32 major honours for his boyhood club.

Brighton ready to consider Moises Caicedo offers,"May 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/brighton-to-consider-moises-caicedo-offers,"Brighton & Hove Albion will consider allowing Moises Caicedo to leave the club this summer if their valuation of the player is met, sources have told 90min. The Seagulls have little intention of becoming a selling club in the long-term, but they are also an analytically driven club and every player has their price. Alexis Mac Allister is set to leave this summer, though many people within Brighton's hierarchy believe that he is the only key player that should have an exit sanctioned ahead of the 2023/24 season. However, 90min has been told that if the bidding for the in-demand Caicedo surpasses a certain number - believed to be Â£80m - then Brighton are ready to have conversations about his future. Brighton rejected all offers for the midfielder in January, with both Chelsea and Arsenal pushing hard and seeing bids of up to Â£70m knocked back. Caicedo made it known in January that he wanted to leave, but within weeks of the window closing he penned a new long-term contract, tying him to the club until 2027 with an option for a further year. READ MORE FROM THE 90MIN TALKING TRANSFERS TEAM feed Despite this new deal, interest in Caicedo has not dissipated and Arsenal are still very interested in taking him to north London. West Hamâs Declan Rice is a player the Gunners like a lot, but 90min understands that Caicedo remains an option as well. Liverpool and Manchester United are also confirmed admirers of Caicedo and retain an interest, while it is believed Manchester City have him on a list of potential backups to top target Jude Bellingham, who is likely to join Real Madrid instead this summer. Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi, who is becoming more involved with the club's transfer decisions, is eager to keep his key men, but potentially bringing in Â£150m for Mac Allister and Caicedo - who cost the club Â£11m combined - would be a staggering bit of business for any club. Should those deals be sanctioned, Brighton have made it clear they will reinvest in the squad. They have already agreed summer deals for Watford's Joao Pedro for a club-record Â£30m, as well as James Milner on a free transfer from Liverpool. LISTEN NOW"
Liverpool maintain interest in Aurelien Tchouameni,"May 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-maintain-interest-aurelien-tchouameni,"Liverpool would be interested in signing Aurelien Tchouameni from Real Madrid even if they could only acquire him on loan, sources have told 90min. The Reds have a long-standing interest in the midfielder and spent much of the 2021/22 season trying to convince him to sign from Ligue 1 side Monaco. Chelsea had also pushed hard for his signature before being placed under sanctions by the UK government. After an impressive two-year stint in the microstate, Tchouameni essentially had the pick of which club to join and ended up heading to European champions Real Madrid, who defeated Liverpool in last year's Champions League final, for a transfer fee that could eventually reach â¬100m. Liverpool's need to retool - particularly in midfield - has become a lot more evident this campaign, and 90min understands they remain huge fans of Tchouameni. feed Liverpool have informed Real Madrid they would be willing to take the 23-year-old off their hands should he become available. Jude Bellingham is expected to head to the Santiago Bernabeu this summer, while Toni Kroos and Luka Modric are likely to pen new deals, making competition for midfield places fierce. Tchouameni has endured a steady but hardly eye-catching debut season in Spain, though has not always been called upon in big games - most recently, he was dropped from the starting lineup to face Manchester City in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final. However, Carlo Ancelotti and the Real Madrid hierarchy do not intend to let the France international leave and the player himself has not displayed any signs of discontent. Nevertheless, even if Tchouameni is not available for a permanent transfer, Liverpool would still be interested in taking him on loan. Other midfielders on Liverpool's radar include Mason Mount, James Maddison, Florian Neuhaus, Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister. Bellingham had been their top target before pulling out of the race to sign him in April."

"Premier League clubs scout Lens stars Kevin Danso, Seko Fofana & Lois Openda","May 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/premier-league-clubs-scout-lens-stars-kevin-danso-seko-fofana-lois-openda,"A number of Premier League clubs sent scouts to watch Kevin Danso, Seko Fofana and Lois Openda during Lens' win over Marseille on Saturday, 90min understands.  Lens have been one of the surprise packages in Ligue 1 this season and currently sit in second place in the table, leapfrogging Marseille with their 2-1 victory at the Stade Bollaert-Delelis.  Key to Lens' astonishing 2022/23 season has been the form of their best players, Danso, Fofana and Openda. That is form which, as expected, has caught the eye of a number of Premier League clubs. 90min understands that Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool, Newcastle, Aston Villa, Wolves and West Ham all sent scouts to the game to watch Lens' three star men.   feed Centre-back Danso, who spent a short time on loan at Southampton during the 2019/20 season, attracted particular interest from Manchester United, Liverpool, Newcastle, Aston Villa and Wolves scouts during the game, with the Austrian bagging an assist to boot.  Throughout the 2022/23 campaign, Danso has been the main man in a defence which has conceded a Ligue 1 low of just 26 goals in 34 games.   Both Manchester United and Liverpool are in the market for some defensive reinforcements this summer, with 90min recently reporting that the two clubs sent scouts to watch Ajax's Jurrien Timber. As well as a centre-back, Liverpool are also notably keen to sign central midfielders during the upcoming transfer window. As such, 90min understands that Reds scouts were also keeping a close eye on the performance of Seko Fofana during the Lens - Marseille game. The midfielder is the club captain and signed a new deal at the Ligue 1 outfit last year, but Liverpool as well as Newcastle and West Ham hold a long-standing interest in the player.  Fofana is on the lengthy list of midfielders Liverpool has kept an eye on in recent months. 90min recently reported that Ibrahim Sangare and Teun Koopmeiners are also among the options, and the club are also keen to finalise a move for Alexis Mac Allister this month.   Sources have confirmed to 90min that Lois Openda is of interest to Arsenal, who have the in-form striker on a list of potential number nine options ahead of the summer.  The 23-year-old has been one of the most in-form strikers in Europe recently, scoring 10 goals in his last eight appearances for Lens - including the winner at the weekend against Marseille.  Along with Openda, Arsenal also retain an interest in Dusan Vlahovic, who is keen to move to the Premier League after a different first full season at Juventus. "

Messi is keen to move back to Barcelona, who are working hard in the background to make a deal financially viable, but Al Hilal have made him a huge offer should he not return to Spain. The Argentine is already an official ambassador for Saudi Arabia's tourism authority, and was recently suspended by PSG for making an unsanctioned visit to the country in the aftermath of the 3-1 defeat to Lorient. Messi's representatives have been speaking with Al Hilal officials in recent weeks and they have made him an offer which is understood to be worth more than â¬400m-a-year - which would make him the highest paid footballer of all time, surpassing the â¬220m-a-year that Cristiano Ronaldo is earning at Al Nassr. feed Sources have told 90min that while Al Hilal believe they are well placed to land Messi, talks are continuing with Barcelona, who are doing everything they can to take him back to Catalonia.

Why Willian rejected Liverpool & Tottenham to join Chelsea,"May 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/why-willian-rejected-liverpool-tottenham-to-join-chelsea,"Willian has revealed that he turned down the chance to join Liverpool in 2013 because he wanted to play for a club in London, while he also rejected Tottenham just minutes away from signing a contract because it was his âdreamâ to join Chelsea. At 34, Willian is enjoying a career resurgence with Fulham, having seen an earlier spell at Arsenal not work out as hoped and then returned to Brazil to join Corinthians. But the veteran winger, who has made his permanent home in London, could have easily had a very different career had he been prepared to join Liverpool a decade ago instead. Willian first arrived in Europe as a teenager when he was scouted by Shakhtar Donetsk way back in 2007. He played more than 220 games for the club and won 10 domestic and European trophies. But interest from Chelsea in particular surfaced as early as 2011 and Shakhtar blocked a transfer. The Sao Paulo native wound up joining short-lived Russian powerhouse Anzhi Makachkala alongside Samuel Etoâo, before that experiment blew up and he was made available for sale. âI went to London,â Willian told PL Brasil. âLiverpool and Tottenham showed interest.Â I was negotiating with both [but] not Chelsea.Â And in my heart the dream was to go to Chelsea. ""Proposals came from both [Liverpool and Tottenham] and, as I wanted to stay in London, I decided that I would go to Tottenham.Â It was alright, I had already done medical tests, all that was left was to go to Tottenham's training ground to sign the contract.â feed Willian admitted that he was going to sign for Tottenham still âwith Chelsea in mindâ. So when an offer from Stamford Bridge finally came through at the 11th hour, he backed out of the Spurs deal. âChelsea made an offer and I didn't think twice,â he recalled.Â âIt was something I really wanted, with all due respect to Tottenham, which is also a great club, but my dream was to play for Chelsea. âWhen I was at Shakhtar, the first club that made an offer for me was Chelseaâ¦in 2011. I started to follow the club, I saw [Didier] Drogba, [John] Terry, went crazy for the Blues and decided that wanted to play for Chelsea.Â It became a dream.â Willian explained that Shakhtar rejected three separate Chelsea offers, even hinting the Ukrainian club reneged on a promise to let him go for a certain amount. He later went on to score twice for Shakhtar at Stamford Bridge in a Champions League game, but Chelsea had âgiven upâ by the time he was determined to leave Donetsk for a new challenge, with only Anzhi prepared to meet a â¬35m release clause. âI thought the club's project was cool,â he said. âI played with Eto'o,Â we were runners-up in the Russian Cup.Â But in the middle of [2013] the owner of the team had a health problem, decided that he would stop investing and sell the players.Â And then my negotiations with English clubs began.â"
Steve McManaman admits Real Madrid's 'aura' key to expected Jude Bellingham move,"May 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/steve-mcmanaman-real-madrid-aura-key-jude-bellingham-move,"Steve McManaman says Real Madrid's aura and ability to offer Jude Bellingham ""the all-round package"" could be key in persuading him to join the club ahead of Manchester City, adding that the teenager can expect to be treated like a god. 19-year-old Bellingham has been heavily linked with Real, City and Liverpool all season long, but 90min revealed last week that a move to the Santiago Bernabeu this summer now looks likely after a positive round of talks with the teenager's father. McManaman spent four years playing for Real Madrid between 1999 and 2003, scoring in the 3-0 win over Valencia in the 2000 Champions League final before winning the competition again two years later, so knows exactly what it's like to play for a club regarded by many to be the biggest in the world.  Speaking exclusively to 90min, McManaman, who also won two La Liga titles and a UEFA Super Cup during his Bernabeu stint, opened up about why Bellingham may opt to join Real instead of one of his Premier League suitors, stating that the ""all-round package"" is hard for any player to resist. ""They have an aura, they have a history, they have the stadium, they have the city, they have the fans who adore the players if you're successful, and I think the all-round package is that,"" McManaman said. ""There's a reason why so many ex-players decide to stay in Madrid [after they retire]. You've got players like Zinedine Zidane, Luis Figo, Santiago Solari, Roberto Carlos, all who are not from Spain yet every one of them resides in Madrid. And they reside in Madrid for a reason, and that reason is that it's a wonderful city and they have a great quality of life. So I think little things like this, not just the football, helps attract people.  Why would Jude Bellingham choose Real Madrid over any other club? ð§Former Madrid player Steve McManaman lists all of the incredible reasons why...@btsportfootball | @btsport pic.twitter.com/9Qh5iqdBNe ""Their stadium is going to be incredible [when completed] next year, and their history of winning things is etched on their shirts. They're always successful every single year.  ""The fact that they can offer him the all-round package and be treated like a hero, like a god, I think that might be the culmination for him."" McManaman also revealed how Bellingham could fit into Real Madrid's side, citing Los Blancos' need to rejuvenate their squad as being a key reason for why the move is being made. ""If he does come in he'll bring a drive to Madrid that I don't think Tchouameni and Camavinga do. They don't play the same way as Jude does. Toni Kroos has still got a number of years left and I know Luka [Modric] is going to be 38 in September.  ""I just think he offers them something else. He offers something different to Tchouameni and Camavinga, and I think Fede Valverde will complement him and work as a runner and a real good ball player. He could have Rodrygo and Vinicius, both young players too, either side of him further forward  and Benzema will get a new contract, of course he will, and Real Madrid are in the market for a new centre forward too. feed ""So I think they're just trying to refresh the squad. They've still got their bit-part players on the bench, and I think they'll keep a lot of them but they'll also move a few on. Financially it won't be a big burden on Madrid because they've still got money to spend. ""It's another really good signing if Jude does go to Madrid."""
Napoli set asking price for Man Utd target Kim Min-jae despite reluctance to sell,"May 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/napoli-set-asking-price-man-utd-target-kim-min-jae,"Napoli have accepted that they may have to sell star defender Kim Min-jae this summer despite long insisting that he will stay at the club, 90min understands. The South Korea international has announced himself as one of the world's leading centre-backs since his move to Serie A from Fenerbahce last summer, and is known to be of interest to Manchester United, Liverpool and a number of other leading clubs. The 26-year-old has played a key role in helping Napoli win their first Scudetto since 1990, and the Partenopei have spent much of the year trying to tie Kim and winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia down to new and improved deals, believing that striker Victor Osimhen would be the only high-profile departure in the summer. While a contract extension is not off the table and they are reluctant to part ways, sources have told 90min that Napoli would find it hard to knock back bids for Kim in excess of â¬60m amid increasing interest. feed Kim's current deal contains a release clause worth around â¬45m which sources believe is active for the first two weeks of the summer transfer window, but an up-front payment of that amount is difficult for any side to action because of Financial Fair Play regulations. 90min understands that Manchester United are in the market for a right-footed centre-back and had representatives at Napoli's 1-0 win over Fiorentina at the weekend. Ajax's Jurrien Timber and Benfica's Antonio Silva are also on their radar. Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham were also at the Stadio Diego Maradona on Sunday and are long-term admirers of Kim - Spurs notably made a play for him when he was at Beijing Guoan in 2020.

The emerging France international has enjoyed a breakout 2022/23 campaign at both club and international level, impressing at the World Cup - his miss in the final against Argentina aside - and scoring 21 goals in all competitions for Frankfurt.  These performance have, as expected, caught the eye of a number of clubs throughout Europe. 90min understands that Kolo Muani has attracted interest from Napoli, Barcelona, Newcastle, Atletico Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester United and Bayern Munich in recent months.  It is Bayern who are firmly the frontrunners to sign the striker however. 90min reported last week that the Bavarians had held talks with the player's representatives over a potential move, viewing Kolo Muani as the ideal replacement for Robert Lewandowski - who left the club last summer. They have even backed away from long-term target Harry Kane in preference for the 24-year-old Frenchman. feed Since Lewandowski left, Bayern have been forced to play Sadio Mane out of position as a striker or utilise veteran former Stoke player Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting as their starting number nine - something which is far from ideal.

Barcelona tell Ansu Fati he can leave amid Premier League interest,"May 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-tell-ansu-fati-he-can-leave-amid-premier-league-interest,"Barcelona have informed Ansu Fati that he can leave the club this summer as one of a number of players whose departure could help finalise the return of Lionel Messi, 90min understands. Messi is determined to head back to Camp Nou this summer, having left to join Paris Saint-Germain in 2021. His return is also seen as a priority for the club, but Barcelona are having to work tirelessly on constructing a deal that wonât fall foul of La Ligaâs financial regulations. Fati was once billed as the future of the club, even inheriting Messiâs iconic number 10 shirt at the age of 18. But injuries in recent seasons have hampered his progress and, even now back consistently fit, the 20-year-old has only been an occasional player in Xaviâs team â just 11 of his 31 La Liga appearances so far in 2022/23 have been as a starter. However, a deal to try and move him on is not straightforward, nor is one close. feed 90min can confirm that agent Jorge Mendes did try to engineer a recently rumoured swap deal with Premier League side Wolves involving midfielder Ruben Neves. But sources have confirmed that while Barcelona do admire Neves, he is far from a top priority this summer â the Catalans are more enamoured with Ilkay Gundogan, who would be available on a free transfer. Wolves are keen on Fati, though, and he also has other interest from England in the shape of West Ham. The Spain international isnât particularly keen on leaving Barcelona as it is. But even if he were, teams that are 13th and 15th respectively in the Premier League standings wonât cut it. Fati would want to join a bigger club that is challenging towards the top end of the table. Manchester United, Arsenal or Chelsea have all been linked in the past, but none of them have any irons in the fire when it comes to a Fati deal at this moment in time."
Dusan Vlahovic interested in move to Premier League,"May 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/dusan-vlahovic-interested-premier-league-transfer-man-utd-arsenal-chelsea-newcastle-aston-villa,"Dusan Vlahovic's representatives have told Premier League clubs that their client is keen to move to England from Juventus, 90min understands.  The Serbian striker joined Juve during the 2022 January transfer window, said to have spurned interest from Arsenal in order to sign for La Vecchia Signora for â¬70m. After a solid first half season with his new club, Vlahovic has largely struggled for form during the current campaign.  Vlahovic had recently gone eight games without a goal before scoring against Lecce and Atalanta in the last week, and has been in and out of the starting XI under Massimilano Allegri. The striker's goal against Atalanta came in a game during which he suffered a barrage of racial abuse from La Dea fans - something he was then ridiculously booked for reacting to.  FIFA president Gianni Infantino has been among the number of high-profile people who've come out to condemn the abuse Vlahovic received, calling on the FIGC apply 'strict sanctions' on Atalanta fans.  feed The incident on Sunday, coupled with Vlahovic's lack of consistent gametime, have led to the Serbian becoming increasingly unsettled at Juve. 90min understands that he is now keen to leave Turin and his representatives are trying to make his preferred move to the Premier League a possibility. As 90min reported at the time, Vlahovic was offered to Manchester United in January and sources have confirmed that they are among the clubs interested in Vlahovic, with the striker being on the Red Devils' list of forward options heading into the summer window. United also harbour an interest in Tottenham star Harry Kane and Napoli goalscorer Victor Osimhen. Arsenal, who have been long-term admirers of Vlahovic, also retain an interest, and 90min understands Chelsea, Newcastle United and the highly-ambitious Aston Villa are on the list of clubs all mulling over a move for the young striker during the summer transfer window"
Harry Kane hints at upcoming talks with Spurs chairman Daniel Levy,"May 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/harry-kane-hints-at-upcoming-talks-with-spurs-chairman-daniel-levy,"Tottenham striker Harry Kane has hinted he could hold talks with chairman Daniel Levy in the coming weeks. It comes at a time when the England captainâs future is again uncertain as the final year of his Spurs contract rapidly approaches. Kane was keen to leave Spurs in the summer of 2021 when Manchester City were determined to sign him, although he has always denied he went as far as refusing to train in an effort to force a transfer. Bayern Munich havenât hidden their desire to sign Kane over the past year, while 90min has reported in recent weeks on both Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain's interest in the 29-year-old.  90min also understands that Spurs are bracing for Chelsea interest in their talisman. As things stand, contract talks with Kane are on hold. Those discussions are set to continue once a new permanent manager is appointed â Julian Nagelsmann and Luis Enrique have each been spoken to about the job, but Spurs continue to also consider a number of alternative options, including Xabi Alonso and Ruben Amorim. No decision is yet close, however. feed ""Thatâs down to the club,â Kane said on the hunt for a manager. âIf I end up speaking with the chairman towards the end of the season, then Iâm sure heâll fill me in on what heâs thinking,â hinting that he could be set for talks with Levy at some point. âBut ultimately weâve got three more games, we donât want to look too far ahead and get too carried away. The club will make the best decision for everyone, for the players, the fans, for the club in general, so weâll just have to wait and see what that is.â 90min understands that in an attempt to convince Kane to commit his future to the club, Spurs are willing to include him in key decisions like hiring the new head coach. Indeed the hierarchy are touching base with the wider squad to gauge their feelings over the job. But by consulting Kane in particular, it is hoped that he would be completely happy with the choice and sign a new deal."
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang names club he wants to leave Chelsea for,"May 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/pierre-emerick-aubameyang-names-club-he-wants-to-leave-chelsea-for,"Chelsea forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has revealed his hopes of re-joining Barcelona at the end of the 2022/23 season.  Aubameyang played for Barcelona between February and September of 2022 after agreeing a mutual termination of his contract at former club Arsenal. He was actually a hit during his first few months in La Liga, managing 11 goals in 17 appearances to help steady the ship for Barcelona during a difficult season on and off the pitch.  Aubameyang then made the move to Stamford Bridge for a reported fee of around Â£10m to work with Thomas Tuchel again - his former coach at Borussia Dortmund. After Tuchel was sacked by new owner Todd Boehly and replaced by Graham Potter, Auba was quickly ostracised and was even left out of the club's UEFA Champions League squad for the knockout rounds.  feed Following Potter's sacking, the striker has found his way back into the team on a more regular basis under caretaker manager Frank Lampard, making a number of cameo appearances for the Blues.  However, speaking on the DjamLife TikTok feed, the extra gametime has not changed the forward's mind regarding his Chelsea future, with Auba stating which club he'd like to join in the summer: ""I'd like to return to Barcelonaâ¦but we will see."" 90min understands that the 33-year-old has been told he can leave and would be available on a free transfer. But while Barcelona have him on their list of possible targets, their first choice to bring in up front remains Athletico Paranaense teenager Vitor Roque. Barcelona have enjoyed a fantastic 2022/23 campaign and all set to secure their first La Liga crown in four years as they sit 13 points clear of second-place Atletico Madrid with just five games remaining.  While their league form has been sublime, however, Xavi's side have struggled in cup competitions - both domestic and European - due to a lack of quality depth in the squad, something signing another forward could help rectify heading into next season.

Barcelona remain confident over Ilkay Gundogan signing,"May 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-remain-confident-ilkay-gundogan-signing,"Barcelona remain confident of finalising a deal to sign Ilkay Gundogan during the summer transfer window, 90min understands. The Man City captain has been in stunning form for his club this season, scoring seven goals and bagging three assists in all competitions.  Gundogan bagged himself two goals in the weekend win over Leeds United at the Etihad Stadium and, speaking after the game to the press, Pep Guardiola pleaded with the German to commit his future to the Citizens. He said: ""I said about the contract, the club is involved and knows my opinion. They are above me, we take the decision together, good and bad. It's not necessary if he scored two incredible goals, how good he played today, reading the spaces, he has everything â incredible run in the final third, how intelligent he is. feed ""It's not necessary to score two goals to know exactly how I like this player and enjoying working with him and how I'd like to work with him in the future.""

Marcel Sabitzer makes admission over future as Man Utd loan nears end,"May 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/marcel-sabitzer-makes-admission-over-future-man-utd-loan-nears-end,"Manchester United midfielder Marcel Sabitzer has admitted he is yet to speak with Bayern Munich or Thomas Tuchel over his future as his loan at Old Trafford nears the end. Sabitzer joined United on a short-term deal until the end of the season in January, providing additional cover to a midfield that had recently lost Christian Eriksen to injury. The Austrian has made a decent impact across his 17 appearances in all competitions so far and, even though Eriksen has since returned to fitness, 90min has already recently revealed that manager Erik ten Hag is keen to make Sabitzerâs deal a permanent one. But the 29-year-old has revealed he is yet to speak to his parent club about the situation. âOf course, there hasnât been any contact up until now, because they have a lot going on and so do we,â Sabitzer has told Sky Sports Germany. âEveryone is focused on their tasks. Weâll discuss and analyse everything calmly and see in which direction itâll go.â feed Things have changed at Bayern since Sabitzer left Munich in January. He was out of favour under Julian Nagelsmann, who has since been replaced by the aforementioned Tuchel. However, 90min understands things with regard to his status at the Allianz Arena are unlikely to be much different. Bayern are not expected to stand in the way of a permanent transfer and would sell for a fee similar to the â¬16m (Â£14.2m) they paid RB Leipzig in the summer of 2021. Other clubs are interested in Sabitzer, but he has settled at United and they are his first choice. Unitedâs ideal situation ahead of next season is to sell a midfielder not in the clubâs long-term plans â Scott McTominay, valued at Â£30m, or Fred â and buy Sabitzer while still in overall net profit. There are then also ambitions to sign a new starting ânumber eightâ."

West Ham eye summer transfer raid for Manchester City duo,"May 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-summer-transfer-raid-manchester-city-duo-kalvin-phillips-kyle-walker,"West Ham United remain interested in signing Kalvin Phillips from Manchester City, 90min understands, and are also eyeing team-mate Kyle Walker. The 27-year-old joined City from Leeds last summer, penning a six-year contract, but has made just eight substitute appearances under Pep Guardiola - the equivalent of 3% of the minutes available to him this season. A shoulder injury did rule Phillips out of action for just shy of two months prior to the World Cup, but Rodri's place at the base of midfield hasn't really come under threat at any point. 90min revealed at the end of March that Phillips is contemplating his future at City, who are chasing a third successive Premier League title under Guardiola. West Ham are known admirers of Phillips and made a cheeky bid to sign him towards the end of the 2022 January transfer window - when he was still a Leeds player. That bid was turned down, as was an offer for team-mate Raphinha, but Phillips has remained on West Ham's radar despite going on to join City. Guardiola was asked about Phillips' future prior to City's Premier League clash with Leeds, where he put the emphasis on the player to prove that he wants to stay at the Etihad. ""It depends on the players,"" Guardiola said. ""At the end we're here, I try to be honest with the questions and my feelings. feed ""My feelings sometimes change. But at the end it belongs to the players, they have to convince themselves and the team and not because I say something. Teams change a lot and players for previous seasons who were incredibly important but this season less important. It's how they perform, many things can happen."" 90min understands that West Ham are making their interest in Phillips known, as they prepare for bids to come in this summer for captain Declan Rice. Arsenal and Chelsea are both interested in signing the 24-year-old, who the Hammers value at around Â£100m, while City themselves have renewed their interest in the event of Phillips, Ilkay Gundogan and Bernardo Silva departing. West Ham have also made noises about City full-back Kyle Walker, who is no longer a regular starter under Guardiola. The Spaniard recently said that the former Tottenham star 'cannot play' in his revamped tactical system - which demands full-backs to invert and play in central areas - and has fallen behind John Stones and Manuel Akanji in the pecking order. City have also been hugely impressed by the emergence of Rico Lewis, who they are preparing to tie down to a new contract, and that could open the door for Walker to move on this summer. One stumbling block could prove to be Walker's excessive pay packet, but sources have told 90min that West Ham are monitoring his situation. Aston Villa and Sheffield United, both former clubs of Walker, have also been linked."
Man Utd favourite questions ability of transfer target Jurrien Timber,"May 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-favourite-questions-ability-transfer-target-jurrien-timber,"Former Manchester United defender Jaap Stam has cast doubt over whether Ajax's Jurrien Timber is good enough to play at centre-back for the Red Devils. The 21-year-old has long been linked with reuniting with Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford, and 90min revealed in March that Timber remains a player of interest. Timber has confessed that he will assess his future in the summer, having chosen to remain in Amsterdam despite having opportunities to leave the Eredivisie and further his career. Manchester United are keen to strengthen their defensive options this summer and are also willing to let existing players leave - Harry Maguire a potential casualty if Ten Hag is able to shape his squad in the way he wants to. But former United defender Stam, a treble winner under Sir Alex Ferguson in 1999, isn't fully convinced by Timber's ability to play at centre half, even though a move would see Ten Hag reunited with a player he helped develop and break into Ajax's first team. ""The big advantage of United for Timber is that he already knows Ten Hag and vice versa,"" Stam told Dutch outlet AD. ""The intentions of the trainer are molded to Timber, but make no mistake: this is the Premier League. ""There you can't always be dominant, you have to duel much more against strikers like Harry Kane and Erling Haaland. feed ""Everyone with Lisandro MartÃ­nez was also curious about that. It turns out that he did it.Â With Timber, I just miss a certain amount of aggression - sometimes even being a little mean - in his game. 'That is also, for example, in giving the first blow before the real duels come. Martinez does. You can learn that too, but it has to be in you. Timber has also been linked with United's bitter rivals Liverpool, but Stam does think that United is the right fit if he plays at full-back instead of centrally. ""You also have to look at combinations and chance of playing time,"" the Dutchman continued. ""United can still use a defender, also because Raphael Varane is prone to injury and Harry Maguire is still disappointing. 'In England I therefore see United as the most logical option. And what I would like to see more often is Timber as a right back.Â There are at United, Dalot without the ball and Wan-Bissaka on the ball don't quite convince me yet."""
Jurgen Klopp reveals Liverpool's stance on 'overpriced' players,"May 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jurgen-klopp-reveals-liverpool-stance-overpriced-players,"Jurgen Klopp insists Liverpool will not overpay for players this summer but remains confident of concluding deals for current targets. The Reds have had a disappointing season by their recent standards and barring a late collapse from Manchester United, are likely to miss out on qualifying for next season's Champions League. Injuries have played a significant part in Liverpool's decline, particularly up front, but midfield fragilities have been exposed a number of times as more and more teams have found a way to combat Klopp's high-intensity style. Brighton & Hove Albion star Alexis Mac Allister is currently Liverpool's primary midfield target, and 90min understands that the Reds are hoping to get a jump on their Premier League rivals by concluding an early deal for the World Cup winner. Chelsea duo Mason Mount and Mateo Kovacic and Bayern Munich's Ryan Gravenberch are other midfielders being eyed by Liverpool, though moves for those three could be dictated by a domino-like effect in the transfer market triggered by Jude Bellingham's decision to join Real Madrid. With a number of clubs shopping in the same space, there's a danger of player prices being overly inflated as selling parties look to engineer the best possible deal. But after withdrawing from the race to sign Bellingham for those reasons, Klopp says Liverpool will not pay over the odds for anyone, regardless of the need for fresh faces. feed ""If they are overpriced we cannot do it. We cannot buy the player then. We will bring in players. I am pretty sure we will bring in the players we want and those who will help us,"" the German said.  ""I am pretty confident of that. You never know 100% until they are signed but it is not new that some clubs might try that [to raise the asking price]. ""Let me say it like this: You identify a position and you have not only one option on the position. That means they should all be good, to be honest really good. You might have a favourite but if the other club doesnât want to sell or someone else will pay the price then we cannot go with it, but usually we got the players we wanted."" One midfielder heading for the Liverpool exit door is veteran James Milner, who is closing in on a move to high-flying Brighton. Klopp would ideally have liked the 37-year-old to stay at Anfield for another year, and spoke of him in glowing terms when pressed on his future. ""Milly knows how highly I value him,"" Klopp said. ""Heâs an incredible part of this team and I would have loved to have worked together with him even longer.â"

Bayern Munich to pursue new striker target following Harry Kane warnings,"May 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-to-pursue-new-striker-target-harry-kane,"Bayern Munich remain interested in signing Harry Kane but do not believe that negotiations with Tottenham Hotspur would be easy and are keen to avoid a protracted saga, 90min understands. The Bavarians are looking to add a striker to their ranks this summer having failed to replace Robert Lewandowski in 2022, with club president Herbert Hainer confirming these plans upon their exit from the Champions League at the quarter-final stage last month. They first made their interest in Kane public in July 2022 when then-boss Julian Nagelsmann - ironically now in the frame for the Spurs job - admitted his admiration in the England captain, infuriating opposite number Antonio Conte. Several senior figures at Bayern have spoken of their adoration for Kane in interviews since, though often have stressed that the finances behind a deal would be a stumbling block. 90min has long reported that Bayern believe Kane would be open to a move abroad, and while this is still the case, sources have confirmed that they are starting to get cold feet. Bayern have held talks with intermediaries and the general feedback has been that any negotiations for Kane would not be easy and they are determined not to get dragged into a lengthy transfer saga. feed 90min understands that while Kane is keeping his options open and a move to the Allianz Arena does still appeal to him, he is delaying a decision on his future until Tottenham appoint a new head coach and director of football, at which point he will reassess contract negotiations. His current deal expires in 2024. But Bayern want to move swiftly in their search for a striker and are now strongly pursuing backup target Randal Kolo Muani. Eintracht Frankfurt are currently asking for â¬100m for the France international, which is a sum Bayern are unwilling to reach and talks are continuing. Head coach Thomas Tuchel was asked about the club's interest in Kolo Muani at a press conference on Friday, initially laughing before replying: ""I cannot confirm that [he is a target]. I wouldn't confirm it even if it were the case. At the moment, that's not a topic."" Kolo Muani has scored 21 goals in 41 games for Frankfurt since joining from Nantes last summer, while he starred in France's run to the World Cup final in Qatar, famously being denied by a superb Emi Martinez save in the last minute of extra-time."
Brighton confirm signing of Joao Pedro from Watford,"May 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/brighton-confirm-signing-joao-pedro-watford,"Brighton have announced signing of Joao Pedro from Watford for a club-record fee on a contract which will run until 2028. The 21-year-old previously played in the Premier League for the Hornets and has netted 11 goals in the Championship this season. The fee agreed between the two clubs is worth over Â£25m. 90min revealed in late April the transfer would be a club record for Brighton, whose previous biggest outlay was the Â£20.7m they forked out for Enock Mwepu in 2021. Pedro will join the Seagulls when the transfer window officially opens. He is another young talent to add to their forward line alongside Evan Ferguson, who has netted four league goals this season.  Technical director David Weir said: ""Joao has been a long-term target of ours, and he has also attracted a lot of interest from across Europe. manual ""So, we are delighted to have reached an agreement with a key target for the club ahead of the summer window opening, and it is great for Joao that he can focus on the new season, with his immediate future settled. ""He's a brilliant young talent, technically very good, quick and with an eye for goal. He will complement our existing forward line very well. He also has settled well here, with good experience of both the Premier League and Championship and more than 100 games for Watford. ""We are really looking forward to starting work with him in pre-season, here in the UK and when we travel to the United States for the Premier League Summer Series."" Pedro joined Watford from Fluminense in 2020 and scored his first goal in England's top flight a year later against Manchester United."
Man Utd make decision on permanent Wout Weghorst signing,"May 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-make-decision-on-permanent-wout-weghorst-signing,"Manchester United's number one priority for the summer transfer window is to sign a new first-choice number 9, with Tottenham's Harry Kane and Napoli's Victor Osimhen high on their list of priority targets. United have struggled to convert chances in the Premier League this season - scoring only 49 goals in 33 matches to date - and missed a host of chances in their late defeat to Brighton on Thursday night at the AMEX Stadium. Manager Erik ten Hag knows that striking efficiency needs to be addressed as the chief port of call ahead of next season, and has recognised that current options Wout Weghorst and Anthony Martial are not capable of being primary centre forward options beyond the end of the current campaign. Weghorst was signed on a six-month loan in January following the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo, and 90min understands United have made a decision not to extend the loan or seek a permanent deal for the 30-year-old, who is contracted to newly-promoted Burnley. United paid Â£2.5m to secure the loan deal but will move on to other targets come the summer, with Weghorst only managing two goals in 26 appearances in all competitions to date. He is yet to score in a Premier League appearance for United. feed Martial has taken the majority of the minutes Weghorst was receiving since his return from injury, and 90min has learned United are hoping to offload Martial in the right circumstances. Martial has missed 17 league games this season due to injury, while United would like to move on from his large wage packet as they enter the second summer of an overhaul of the playing squad.  Paris Saint-Germain have been long-term admirers of the 27-year-old and it's understood United will not demand a huge fee if they're to part ways with Martial, though it remains to be seen how much interest there will be in the player, who was sent on loan to Sevilla in the second half of last season. Offloading Martial and deciding against the purchase of Weghorst would leave United short of centre forward options, though they do have the option to play Marcus Rashford through the middle if required. Rashford has, however, found his best position from the left of the attack under Ten Hag, and has enjoyed the best scoring season of his career with 29 in all competitions to date. United would like to continue with Rashford from the left and find a long-term answer at centre forward to complement him, and the club have been exploring what it would take to convince Tottenham to part with Kane, the England captain. Kane, along with Victor Osimhen - who this week won Serie A with Napoli - are among a batch of targets who would be ready to take the role of first choice centre forward straight away, while as reported last month, Dusan Vlahovic and Lautaro Martinez are considered alternative options. United see another group of younger forwards as ""project players"", with likely cheaper transfer fees and room for improvement under Ten Hag's coaching.

What Jurgen Klopp had to say about Alexis Mac Allister Liverpool transfer,"May 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/what-jurgen-klopp-had-to-say-alexis-mac-allister-liverpool-transfer,"Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was asked about the club's interest in Brighton star Alexis Mac Allister at a press conference on Friday. The Reds have long been tipped to add midfield reinforcements to their squad this summer following a season in which their weaknesses in this area have been greatly exposed. 90min reported earlier on Friday that Liverpool are indeed hoping to sign up to three midfielders in time for the 2023/24 season, with Mac Allister replacing Real Madrid-bound Jude Bellingham atop their shortlist. Liverpool intend to push ahead with a move that could be completed by the end of May. One player who could be making the reverse journey from Anfield to the Amex Stadium is James Milner. Sources have told 90min that Brighton are closing in on a deal for the veteran utility man with his contract up at the end of the season. Klopp was asked about both Milner and Mac Allister on Friday ahead of Liverpool's Premier League clash with Brentford this weekend. ""All others things, transfer-wise, you will be the first to be informed if something will happen,"" Klopp said. ""But before then, nothing really to say about it."" feed On Milner in particular, Klopp said: ""Milly I can say, over the years and months that I had really good conversations with him. He knows how highly I value him. He's an incredible part of this team and I would have loved to have work together with him even longer. ""What exactly the outcome will be of his decision, I think Milly will say that at one point. I'm not sure if it happened already or not, I'm not really aware of that. ""Nothing else to say from me but nothing will change. I've said it a couple of times, what happened over the past seven and a half years, all the positive things, none of it would happen without James Milner."" In addition to Mac Allister, there are a number of other midfielders that Liverpool have their eyes on. 90min understands that the likes of England internationals Mason Mount and James Maddison are on the Reds' radar. Liverpool are believed to be the frontrunners to sign Ryan Gravenberch should he leave Bayern Munich this summer, with the Dutchman asking the German champions to soften their stance over a potential exit. Klopp previously stated that his scouts have eyes on at least 12 midfielders. LISTEN NOW"
Eddie Howe shares Newcastle transfer plans ahead of Champions League qualification,"May 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/eddie-howe-shares-newcastle-transfer-plans-champions-league-neymar,"Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe insists that the club will only sign the ""right players"" as they continue their progression under new ownership - but will have to keep a close eye on finances at the same time. The Magpies are closing in on a place in the Champions League with five games of the domestic season remaining, holding a six point lead over fifth placed Liverpool with a game in hand. They welcome second placed Arsenal to St. James' Park this weekend. Newcastle will inevitably need to plan ahead and with potential qualification for the Champions League coming ahead of schedule this season, thoughts will soon turn to how they get their squad ready to compete with Europe's elite. Majority shareholders PIF are the wealthiest owners in the Premier League, and have already spent nearly a quarter of a billion pounds on players since taking over the club in late 2021. feed 90min revealed earlier this week that PIF were keen on bringing Brazilian Neymar to the club, which they feel would be within their means. Qualification for the Champions League will also free up spending power under FFP rules. However, Howe remains reserved about possible targets and the finances behind them - in a week that also saw them linked with Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. ""Since the takeover, naturally everyone has assumed that the biggest names in world football will be going to Newcastle. Now, weâve not recruited in that way. Financially, we canât recruit that way at the moment,"" said Howe ahead of the weekend clash with Arsenal. ""But also, we have to bring the right people and the right players into the group. I will say that the transfer market is such a complex decision. You canât just pick a name and bring them in â thereâs got to be a lot of thought goes into what weâre doing, both financially and looking at the players. ""It doesnât frustrate me because the players you mention are incredible players. I donât waste any time over speculation. I know what direction I want to take the team in."""
Chelsea & Man Utd target Victor Osimhen sends transfer message after Napoli title win,"May 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-man-utd-target-victor-osimhen-sends-transfer-message-napoli,"Chelsea and Manchester United transfer target Victor Osimhen said it wasn't the right time to talk about his future after Napoli sealed a first Serie A title for 33 years on Thursday night. Napoli's 1-1 draw with Udinese was enough to earn them a first league title since the days of Diego Maradona; a rich reward for a 2022/23 campaign that has seen the club blitz clear of Lazio, Inter, Milan and Juventus. Osimhen's contribution to Napoli's cause has been invaluable. The 24-year-old has bagged 22 goals in 27 Serie A appearances, while also netting five goals in six Champions League outings. His blistering form has captured the attention of Chelsea and Man Utd among others, and 90min understands that the former are confident they can lure Osimhen to the Premier League even though Champions League football will not be on offer at Stamford Bridge next season. If a deal is to materialise, interested parties will likely need to stump up at least Â£100m to satisfy Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis, who has publicly stated that the Nigerian goal machine is not for sale. Osimhen was Napoli's goalscorer on the night they secured the title, and he was asked after the game about what winning the title meant to him in addition to questions about his future. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the former Lille forward was coy about his next steps. âIt is a fantastic emotion for me, we waited so many years to bring the Scudetto to Napoli and we succeeded, it is a day we will never forget for the rest of our lives,"" Osimhen replied to DAZN. feed ""Now letâs go celebrate with the public in our stadium. [Is it the] greatest satisfaction of my life? I couldnât have quantified this feeling, it is truly wonderful. At the beginning of the season we were underdogs, not many people believed in us but thanks to the union, a great coach, the president and everyone in the club we were able to believe in the Scudetto and win it. Now we enjoy the moment."" ""Itâs not the right time to discuss my future,"" he added of his future. ""I just want to enjoy this incredible title. I canât wait to return to Napoli and hug the fans - Iâm so happy for them. ""In what aspect do I feel I have improved in Serie A? I will forever be grateful to this league, to this competition. As I always say, I am learning the role of a striker and with Napoli it was immediately good emotions. I feel I have improved a lot, thanks especially to [Luciano] Spalletti and his staff, they gave me confidence to be able to grow and score a lot of goals."" Osimhen has just over two years remaining on his contract in Naples and is believed to be earning around â¬4.5m (Â£3.9m) per year - an amount that is likely to increase considerably should he decide to make the move to the Premier League."
Liverpool keen to finalise early Alexis Mac Allister transfer,"May 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-keen-to-finalise-early-alexis-mac-allister-transfer,"Liverpool are pushing ahead with their bid to sign Brighton & Hove Albion star Alexis Mac Allister and would like to secure a deal this month, sources have told 90min. The 24-year-old has been one of the Premier League's most consistent players this season, and scored a clutch penalty for Brighton in their 1-0 win over Manchester United on Thursday. The goal was Mac Allister's ninth Premier League strike of the 2022/23 campaign, with his contributions in midfield helping push Brighton towards a top-six finish and qualification for next season's Europa League. Mac Allister's prolonged outstanding form has attracted the interest of a number of Premier League clubs, and the Argentine, who lifted the World Cup with his country in December, looks set to leave the Amex Stadium this summer in a bid to further his career. Liverpool, who are looking to bring in up to three new midfielders this summer, are heading the queue for Mac Allister, 90min understands, and talks have taken place with the player's representatives and his father, Carlos - who confirmed last month that he was looking to strike a deal before the end of the season. The Reds are fearful of rival clubs coming in for Mac Allister, and that's a key reason for them wanting to strike a deal sooner rather than later. However, Brighton are in no hurry to sell as they know Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham, Chelsea and Newcastle are all keeping tabs on the situation. feed Mac Allister signed a new and improved contract before the World Cup, which puts Brighton, who have previously received significant transfer fees when selling Ben White and Marc Cucurella among others, in a strong negotiating position. Indeed, sources have told 90min that a deal may need to be worth as much as Â£70m to Mac Allister away from the south coast, with the Seagulls only willing to do business on their terms. As it stands Brighton hope that Mac Allister will be their only major departure this summer, but a number of the club's players are continuing to attract interest. Ecuadorian midfielder Moises Caicedo was the subject of bids from Chelsea and Arsenal in January, and although he has since signed a new contract, the Seagulls are anticipating renewed interest in his services this summer."

Newcastle owners exploring blockbuster Neymar transfer from PSG,"May 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/newcastle-owners-exploring-blockbuster-neymar-transfer-psg,"Newcastle United's majority shareholders PIF are interested in bringing Paris Saint-Germain star Neymar to the Premier League, sources have told 90min. PIF want Newcastle to make a 'marquee' signing this summer, and believe the fact they are set to finish in the top four and qualify for the Champions League should be used to their advantage. A potential move for Cristiano Ronaldo has also been discussed by PIF, and they do have a direct relationship with his current club Al-Nassr, but the 38-year-old is not considered a natural fit in the Newcastle team moving forward by manager Eddie Howe.  Sources insist that despite interest in Ronaldo, they would not, and will never, force any player into the manager's squad that he and the coaching staff didn't want to integrate. Neymar, however, is a different case. Newcastle are in the market for a left-sided forward before next season and would like to strengthen their squad ahead of their likely return to the Champions League - adding desired star power in the process. feed 31-year-old Neymar is also seen as a relatively natural fit within the squad which would also continue to elevate its quality - a strong Brazilian contingent has already been built, with Bruno Guimaraes and Joelinton two of the club's most popular and in-form players this season. 90min understands that PSG are open to selling Neymar in the summer as they look to fix what many consider a broken culture at the club, with Lionel Messi's departure also confirmed earlier this week after an unauthorised trip to Saudi Arabia. He has been suspended from the club for two weeks and will leave when his contract expires in June. Neymar could be next on the agenda, though PSG realise only a handful of clubs in the world would be able to facilitate a deal for the Brazilian. He still has two years left on his current contract with an option to extend by a year, but PSG want to part ways before next season. The former Barcelona forward has long been a target for a section of PSG supporters who feel he is not performing at this best and should leave the club. Only this week he was the subject of a protest outside his house in the French capital. ð¸ PSG fans in front of Neymar's house pic.twitter.com/wXgIOBNM6M Neymar has been with PSG since 2017 when they paid Barcelona a world record â¬222m, and they would look to recoup a significant fee for him. Sources have told 90min that PSG would likely require a deal in excess of Â£75m, but with PIF, and Champions League financing, that would not be an issue for Newcastle. Newcastle know they can afford the deal, but also believe they could offer Neymar a move to a club where he would be 'loved' and 'worshipped' by the club's fanbase. Marketing opportunities are also, clearly, an option that any club looking to sign him would take into consideration. Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea are also been linked with a move, and 90min understands that all the Premier League's major clubs are being kept abreast of developments with Neymar and his future by the player's representatives."
Raphinha & Ferran Torres headline Arsenal's winger shortlist,"May 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/raphinha-ferran-torres-headline-arsenal-s-winger-shortlist,"Arsenal will look to sign a right-sided winger this summer ahead of their return to the Champions League, 90min understands. The Gunners have come on leaps and bounds this season, pushing reigning champions Manchester City all the way in the Premier League title race. With Arsenal now a point behind Man City and having played a game more, their title challenge is likely to fall short, but they have already achieved their pre-season aim of returning to the Champions League, securing their first top-four finish since 2016. Down the stretch of this season, Arsenal's lack of depth has been exposed and they are in need of reinforcements if they are to compete on all fronts next year. Sources have told 90min that the north Londoners are targeting a right winger, centre-back, central midfielder and perhaps a centre forward in the summer. There are several players on Arsenal's shortlist of wingers, including Barcelona duo Raphinha and Ferran Torres. 90min reported in January that the Gunners targeted the duo as alternatives to Chelsea-bound Mykhailo Mudryk, before eventually settling on a more attainable option in Brighton's Leandro Trossard. READ MORE FROM THE 90MIN TALKING TRANSFERS TEAM feed Arsenal also tried to sign Raphinha from Leeds United last summer prior to his move to Camp Nou. Other wingers on Arsenal's transfer radar include Bayer Leverkusen's Moussa Diaby, who has been a long-term target for Newcastle United and has always eyed a move to the Premier League. However, with PSG set to lose Lionel Messi and potentially Neymar, his hometown club are hugely interested in a reunion. Out-of-contract Crystal Palace star Wilfried Zaha is still admired by Arsenal and contact has been made regarding a potential move, though he is only a backup option at this stage. Nevertheless, the Gunners are doing their due diligence on the Ivorian and know he is someone who could easily slot in straight away. LISTEN NOW"

The 37-year-old has remained an important rotation option for the Reds even late into his long career, with his first professional appearance coming over two decades ago. His deal at Anfield is up in the summer and 90min reported at the end of March that while Liverpool do intend to offer him a new one, it is not particularly high on their list of priorities. This has opened the door for other clubs to wrestle into the picture, and sources have told 90min that  Brighton believe they are close to securing an agreement with Milner. Nottingham Forest and boyhood club Leeds United would like him to wait until the end of the season to assess his options as they too are interested, while Liverpool's rivals Everton are in the same camp.

Borussia Dortmund respond to Real Madrid's advanced talks with Jude Bellingham,"May 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/borussia-dortmund-respond-real-madrid-advanced-talks-jude-bellingham,"Borussia Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl has been quizzed on reports that Real Madrid are nearing the signing of Jude Bellingham. 90min reported on Wednesday that following a key meeting between Bellingham's father and Real Madrid chief scout Juni Calafat earlier this week, the midfielder is closing in on a move to the Santiago Bernabeu. Liverpool pulled out of the race to sign Bellingham in April as their squad-wide rebuild takes shape, leaving Los Blancos and Manchester City as the main contenders for his signature. Dortmund also held out hope he would sign a new contract but with a fair release clause to kick in for the summer 2024 window. 90min has long stated that while Dortmund will cooperate with Bellingham to help him seal the transfer of his choosing, they will stand firm and demand a club-record fee - this currently stands at â¬144m, which was paid by Barcelona for winger Ousmane Dembele in 2017. Sources have now told 90min that although the footballing world now expects Bellingham to head to Spain, Dortmund have not yet heard from the 19-year-old or Real Madrid to confirm his plans. feed Sporting director Kehl was asked by Sky Sports Germany of Real Madrid's advancing interest, but was dismissive with his answer. ""We want to become champions here in Bundesliga, it's out total priority. We're subordinating everything else to that right now,"" he said.

Erik ten Hag discusses Man Utd's summer transfer budget,"May 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/erik-ten-hag-discusses-man-utd-summer-transfer-budget,"Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has admitted he is currently unsure how much he will have to spend on transfers this summer. The Red Devils have made great progress under the Dutchman in his first season at Old Trafford - they look likely to secure qualification back to the Champions League and could end the season with two trophies. During his first summer window, Ten Hag was backed with big-money signings of Lisandro Martinez, Casemiro, Antony and Tyrell Malacia, while Christian Eriksen joined on a free transfer from Brentford. Wout Weghorst and Marcel Sabitzer arrived on loan in January to add depth to the squad, but further reinforcements are needed if Man Utd are to truly challenge for the top honours again. Amid fresh reports that Man Utd could have Â£100m plus player sales to spend in the summer - regardless of whether the Glazers own the club or not - Ten Hag was asked about his upcoming transfer budget at a press conference on Wednesday. feed ""I don't have influence on that,"" he said of the budget. ""I don't know. ""The only thing I know is that Manchester United is one of the biggest clubs, among maybe the two biggest clubs in the world from a fanbase perspective.

""But in football you need funds to construct squads because the level from your players makes you successful or not."" There are a number of star names on Man Utd's radar this summer.

Lionel Messi focused on sealing Barcelona return after PSG suspension,"May 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/lionel-messi-focused-sealing-barcelona-return-psg-suspension,"Lionel Messi remains determined to return to former club Barcelona this summer after his relationship with Paris Saint-Germain hit a new low, 90min understands.

Man Cityâs midfield transfer options after Jude Bellingham Real Madrid blow,"May 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-city-midfield-transfer-options-jude-bellingham-real-madrid-blow,"After months and months...and months of speculation, Jude Bellingham appears to have decided his next move. Manchester City had genuine hope that they could persuade the 19-year-old to continue his career under the watchful eye of Pep Guardiola, but Real Madrid now look to be closing in on a deal after holding further talks with his representatives. Bellingham's stock is perhaps the highest of any footballer in the world. Tipped for greatness on the world stage, he's had City, Real and Liverpool in the palm of his hands over the past 12 to 18 months, with each club putting forward their case that joining them would give him the best possible platform to showcase his talent. City's argument is pretty compelling. They have Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland on their books - undoubtedly two of the best players in the world - and an overall squad that is the envy of every team in England and almost all in Europe. They also have Guardiola at the helm until at least 2025, with his reputation as the world's top coach continuing to soar as City's dominance, which could yield a first Champions League success in June, continues. But with Bellingham now out of their grasp, City must regroup and plan their next steps. Not only is a move for the future of England's midfield not happening, Bernardo Silva is pushing for an exit from the Etihad Stadium this summer and club captain Ilkay Gundogan could be joining him - the 32-year-old is out of contract and has attractive options to find a new challenge. That leaves City, potentially, needing to rebuild a core part of their midfield, though luckily their extensive scouting of the transfer market means they are not short of options after missing out on Bellingham. Age: 24Club: West Ham United With just two years remaining on his contract this summer, the time for Declan Rice to leave West Ham appears to be now. The 24-year-old is a star turn in both the defensive and box-to-box midfield role, and although he doesn't offer the same level of attacking threat that Bellingham does, his overall game is incredibly impressive and more than suitable for a team competing for honours. Excellent at intercepting the ball in the passing lanes, Rice is also brilliant on the ball - he has superb close control, a burst of pace that rarely sees him outrun in midfield, and the ability to drive forward into space and be a threat in the final third (check out his goal against Gent in the Europa Conference League for evidence of that). Renewed energy in midfield could be exactly what City need, particularly with Gundogan's departure looking more and more likely too. Arsenal and Chelsea are also interested in Rice, making a deal more complicated to complete, but he remains near the top of the club's shortlist. Age: 28Club: Chelsea Not much more needs to be said about Chelsea's sorry 2022/23 campaign - but the obvious thing that needs emphasising is that good players will be departing this summer to reduce the size of the squad. One of those leaving west London could be Croatian midfielder Mateo Kovacic, who has crept onto the radar of City, Manchester United and Liverpool in recent months and could be available for a reasonable, by Premier League standards at least, price. Kovacic is another well-rounded midfielder who is more than capable of mixing it at the highest level, although he'd the first to admit that his performances for Chelsea during 2022/23 have been below par. Age: 20Club: Bayer Leverkusen Widely regarded as one of European football's brightest young prospects, Bayer Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz is firmly in City's crosshairs. The German attacking midfielder would have been a bigger star than he is now were it not for a serious knee ligament sidelining him for nine months, but his stock has risen again after some impressive showings under Xabi Alonso. Whether or not Wirtz will be allowed to leave Leverkusen is another matter - he's contracted to the club until 2027 - but Barcelona are also sniffing and Newcastle, soon to be Champions League qualifiers, are known to have been interested previously. Age: 20Club: Celta Vigo Another potential young gun for City to move for is Celta Vigo's Gabri Veiga, though he'll be difficult to attain given the large amount of interest in his services. The 20-year-old Spaniard is courting interest from Real Madrid, Barcelona and a number of other clubs - Manchester United, Newcastle, Arsenal and Tottenham among his Premier League suitors - and is available for a relatively modest â¬40m - a release clause that was inserted into the new contract he signed last year. However, the allure of playing for Guardiola could be a deciding factor in what Veiga decides to do next, with scouts parricularly impressed by his playmaking abilities and composure on the ball. Age: 24Club: Brighton & Hove Albion Another player attracting a significant amount of interest is one a little closer to home - Brighton's World Cup winner, Alexis Mac Allister. The Argentine has enjoyed a wonderful season to help push the Seagulls towards European qualification next year, but it appears he is ready to take the next step in his career after honing his craft under Graham Potter and then Roberto De Zerbi. The sticking point for City could be Brighton's lofty valuation of Mac Allister - they have proven with the sales of Ben White, Leandro Trossard and Marc Cucurella that they won't be bullied into selling players on the cheap - and he could command a fee of as much as Â£70m. Money isn't an issue for City as Bellingham would have cost far more, but resale value in the future and Mac Allister's adaptability to different systems may be taken into consideration before any move is made. Age: 19Club: Southampton The most appealing option to Manchester City may be former academy graduate Romeo Lavia, who was allowed to join Southampton at the beginning of the season to play regular first team football. Crucially, City inserted a buyback clause into the deal, though that Â£40m option doesn't become active until 2024. With Southampton looking more and more likely to be relegated, the Premier League champions elect may be forced to move quickly to secure the Belgian - Arsenal and Chelsea are showing serious interest."
Shirt numbers Jude Bellingham could wear at Real Madrid,"Jun 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/shirt-numbers-jude-bellingham-could-wear-real-madrid,"One of football's longest-running transfer sagas is finally at an end - Jude Bellingham has joined Real Madrid.   The midfielder has put pen to paper on a six-year deal at the club, with Los Blancos paying an initial â¬100m fee for his services. Bellingham is set to become the first Englishman since David Beckham to bear the white of Real Madrid. But which number will accompany him on those famous old strips? Here is Bellingham's shirt number history and the options currently available to him at the Santiago Bernabeu. feed Ever since breaking into Birmingham City's first team as a 16-year-old, Bellingham has only worn one number at club level - 22. There are a few other numbers that Bellingham has donned while on international duty with England at various age levels. In addition to his favourite 22, Bellingham has also adorned the numbers 7, 8, 10, 18, 19, 21, 23 and 26. Well, Jude, I'm afraid I've got some bad news - none of the shirt numbers you've previously worn in your career are currently up for grabs at Real Madrid. The number 7 is taken by Vinicius Junior, 8 by Toni Kroos, 18 by Aurelien Tchouameni, 21 by a returning Brahim Diaz, 22 by Antonio Rudiger and 23 by Ferland Mendy. The number 26 is forbidden for senior players due to La Liga registration rules decreeing they must wear shirts between one and 25. With Diaz likely to leave once again this summer, following a loan move to AC Milan during the 2022/23 season, the number 21 jersey could become available for the midfielder.  If Bellingham doesn't fancy that, then the numbers 14 and 25 are available to him too."
Real Madrid close on Jude Bellingham deal after key weekend meeting,"May 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/real-madrid-close-on-jude-bellingham-deal-key-weekend-meeting,"Real Madrid believe they are closing in on an agreement to sign Jude Bellingham following a key meeting with his father at the weekend, 90min understands. The 19-year-old has quickly emerged as one of the world's elite midfielders ever since his move to Borussia Dortmund in 2020. His future has been the hot topic of discussion all season long, with Real Madrid mainly competing against Manchester City and Liverpool for his signature. feed 90min reported in April that Liverpool had cooled their interest in Bellingham this year, leaving Real Madrid and Man City in the race, while Borussia Dortmund still had hope that he could sign a new contract with a fair release clause. But sources have now confirmed to 90min that after a meeting between Bellingham's father and Real Madrid chief scout Juni Calafat on Monday, the midfielder is close to reaching an agreement to head to the Santiago Bernabeu. Calafat has been responsible for the recruitment of some Real Madrid's brightest young stars in recent years, including Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, Eder Militao, Endrick and now Bellingham. Real Madrid's pursuit of Bellingham is part of the reason why contract talks have slowed with fellow midfielder Luka Modric, who is likely to see his chances limited by the Englishman's arrival. Los Blancos have already agreed terms over a new deal with Toni Kroos and he is likely to be the only veteran out-of-contract midfielder to stay in the Spanish capital. Borussia Dortmund will still crucially demand a club-record fee in order to sell Bellingham this summer - this figure stands at over â¬144m, which Barcelona paid to sign Ousmane Dembele in 2017.

Cristiano Ronaldo turned down by non-league side,"May 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/cristiano-ronaldo-turned-down-by-non-league-side,"National League side Bromley have officially ruled themselves out of the race to sign Cristiano Ronaldo. Reports from across Europe claim that Ronaldo wants to leave Al Nassr just five months after heading to Saudi Arabia. His stint in the Middle East has been far from successful from a playing standpoint despite his lucrative salary - they have fallen behind in the race for the Saudi Pro League title and eliminated from every cup competition. Ronaldo found himself short of suitors when he tried to force an exit from Manchester United last summer, so it's hard to imagine where any new interested parties could emerge from. Chelsea explored a deal before then-manager Thomas Tuchel fought back against the wishes of co-owner Todd Boehly, while Bayern Munich and Eintracht Frankfurt had to publicly deny that they wanted the Portugal star. READ MORE FROM THE 90MIN TALKING TRANSFERS TEAM feed Back in England, the National League play-offs are about to begin, with six sides vying for promotion to the fourth tier of League Two. One of the teams in the mix is Bromley from south-east London. The Twitter account for Vanarama - the sponsors of the National League - photoshopped Ronaldo into their kit on Tuesday. Nah, you're alright. https://t.co/aBGwyLUeQZ But swiftly and sternly, Bromley moved to nip this in the bud, responding with: ""Nah, you're alright."" The move serves as a blow to Ronaldo who is now likely to end the 2022/23 season without silverware - a National League play-off medal will remain missing from his mantlepiece. LISTEN NOW"
Bayern Munich ready to listen to offers for Sadio Mane,"May 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-ready-to-listen-to-offers-for-sadio-mane,"Bayern Munich are open to parting ways with forward Sadio Mane after just 12 months at the club, 90min understands. Mane joined Bayern from Liverpool last summer in a deal worth around Â£35m but the Senegal international has failed to hit the heights expected of him, recording seven goals and four assists in 22 Bundesliga outings. Off the field, Mane has also attracted unwanted attention after a physical altercation with teammate Leroy Sane which saw him handed a suspension and a fine. Sources have confirmed to 90min that new Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel has not been impressed by Mane and has made it clear to those in charge at the Allianz Arena that he is prepared to offload the 31-year-old this summer. Bayern have long been planning to sign a new central striker this summer, with the likes of Tottenham's Harry Kane and Eintracht Frankfurt's Randal Kolo Muani on their radar, and Tuchel is willing to cash in on Mane to help fund such a move. feed While Mane's age means Bayern are unlikely to demand a significant fee for his services, there is an awareness that his wage demands will limit the number of sides able to strike a deal. Interest in Mane is expected from the Premier League, where Mane racked up 111 goals and 47 assists across 263 games for Liverpool and Southampton, while Bayern also see Paris Saint-Germain as viable suitors. As well as a new central striker, Bayern are also known admirers of Chelsea forward Kai Havertz and could pursue a move for the German this summer. While Havertz has spent most of his Chelsea career in a central role, Bayern are understood to see the 23-year-old as a replacement for Thomas Muller, who has made a career out of floating around behind an out-and-out striker."
Bayern Munich hold talks over Eintracht Frankfurt's Randal Kolo Muani,"May 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-hold-talks-eintracht-frankfurt-randal-kolo-muani,"Bayern Munich have met with the representatives of Randal Kolo Muani as they consider making a move for the Eintracht Frankfurt forward this summer, 90min understands. The 24-year-old has enjoyed an outstanding debut campaign in the Bundesliga, contributing 13 goals and ten assists in 28 appearances after joining on a free transfer from Nantes following the expiry of his contract. Kolo Muani has added a further seven goals in Champions League and DFB-Pokal competition, while he also enjoyed a prominent showing at the World Cup finals with France. Able to play anywhere across the forward line, Kolo Muani has attracted the interest of a number of top clubs through his good form - Napoli, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Newcastle and Paris Saint-Germain among the sides to show interest. Manchester United have also looked at Kolo Muani as they bid to sign a new number nine, but sources have confirmed to 90min that Bayern Munich are firmly in the mix and have held talks with the player's representatives over a potential summer move.  feed The Bavarians are still looking for a replacement for Robert Lewandowski, who departed for Barcelona last summer, and are exploring their options with Sadio Mane's arrival not working out as planned. Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting has led the line for Bayern for most of the season, with Mane playing a peripheral role because of injury and ill-discipline, but he's 34 and unlikely to fire Bayern to domestic and European glory - his ten-goal return this season is the best of his career to date. Frankfurt would like to keep Kolo Muani for one more season and have made it clear up to this point they do not want to sell, but 90min understands that they will allow him to leave if their valuation is met - though it may take a bid close to â¬100m for Bayern or any other interested party to get a deal done."

Fikayo Tomori attracting Premier League interest,"May 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/fikayo-tomori-attracting-premier-league-interest,"AC Milan centre-back Fikayo Tomori is attracting plenty of interest from a number of Premier League sides, 90min understands. Tomori swapped Chelsea for Milan in 2021 and has enjoyed a sensational few years in Serie A, winning the league title in 2021/22 and helping to steer the Rossoneri to the semi-final of this season's Champions League. Saturday's 1-1 draw with Roma was attended by numerous scouts from across England who were keeping an eye on several players. Roma striker Tammy Abraham was a primary focus but sources have confirmed to 90min that Tomori was a key target for many. The 25-year-old only managed 45 minutes of action, picking up an injury and being replaced at half-time, but there was still time for scouts to update their reports of Tomori. 90min understands that Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle were all paying close attention to Tomori during the game, while former employers Chelsea were also watching their former academy star's progress. Liverpool are not believed to have been represented at the game but the Reds are known admirers of Tomori as well. feed Sources state that Tomori would be interested in a return to the Premier League as he believes such a move would aid his quest to feature regularly for the England national team. Despite loud calls from England fans, Tomori has not featured for England since June 2022 and has just three caps to his name, and he was not part of the squad for the 2022 World Cup just six months after winning the Serie A title. âThere was a disappointment not going to the World Cup but that's football, you just have to move on,â said Tomori after his omission from the tournament was confirmed. 90min understands that Tomori sees a return to the Premier League as the best route to more minutes for his country and he would consider offers to return this summer."
Aston Villa confident of signing Tammy Abraham despite European interest,"May 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/aston-villa-confident-of-signing-tammy-abraham-european-interest,"Aston Villa are confident of signing Tammy Abraham this summer despite interest from a number of top clubs around Europe, 90min understands.  The 25-year-old is into his second full season at AS Roma after joining the club from Chelsea for a reported Â£34m fee in 2021, and has scored 25 Serie A goals during his time in the Italian capital. Eight of Abraham's goals have come during the 2022/23 campaign, and he scored a crucial goal at the weekend to earn Jose Mourinho's Roma a 1-1 draw with UEFA Champions League semi-finalists AC Milan at the Stadio Olimpico.  It was a goal that was witnessed by a number of top clubs from around Europe, with 90min understanding that Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham, Newcastle, Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich all sent scouts to watch the game. Abraham is understood to have been the 'centre of attention' for many of those clubs, but sources have told 90min that Aston Villa remain confident of signing a player who fired them to promotion to the Premier League during a hugely successful 2018/19 loan spell - 90min first reported the Villans' interest in February. READ MORE FROM THE 90MIN TALKING TRANSFERS TEAM feed Indeed. Abraham scored 25 goals in 37 Championship appearances for Villa, before returning to parent club Chelsea to become first choice under the management of Frank Lampard. To facilitate a move though, Villa will likely need to stump up at least Â£40m for Abraham, which would break the club's transfer record - Emiliano Buendia is currently their record acquisition in a deal that could eventually be worth Â£38m to Norwich City. Sources have further confirmed to 90min that Abraham was not the only player attracting attention during the game, with defensive midfielder Sandro Tonali of interest to Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham, and Rafael Leao under the watchful eye of Chelsea and PSG - the Portuguese international is expected to stay at Milan, however, and is closing in on a new contract."
Man City set Bernardo Silva price tag as Barcelona & PSG eye summer transfer,"May 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-city-bernardo-silva-price-tag-barcelona-psg-summer-transfer,"Manchester City will not stand in Bernardo Silva's way if he insists that he wants to leave this summer, but they will demand their full valuation of him is met, 90min understands. Silva was keen to leave City last summer for Barcelona, but the club stood firm and told the Portugal international he would not be allowed to leave this season. Barcelona also came calling in January, but again City insisted that he would remain part of their squad until this summer at least. Now, the Catalans are ready to return ahead of next season to try and get Silva once more - if he pushes for the move as expected. Pep Guardiola has long made it clear to all his players that he does not want anyone to stay if they do not wish to play for the club, no matter who they are. City have shown that in recent years allowing the likes of Leroy Sane, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Gabriel Jesus to leave the club. City sources insist that same would be true of Silva, despite his importance to the team - if he wants to leave, he can. But the former Monaco star is under contract until 2025 and any club wanting him will have to pay his market value, which 90min understands is seen at around Â£75m. Paris Saint-Germain are huge fans of Silva and are ready to make a move. Yet it is clear that if he does decide to leave the Etihad Stadium, he only has eyes for one club and that is Barcelona. feed However, Barcelona are keeping eyes on more than just Silva. They are keen on a number of players this summer, including fellow City midfielder Ilkay Gunodgan, who has the added benefit of being available as a free agent if his contract runs down - 90min has already reported that an agreement is close even though City are holding onto hope a new deal could be agreed. But despite pushing for Gundogan and Silva, Barcelona's priority signing is still Lionel Messi. They are working hard to put together a deal, which also needs to be ratified by La Liga, who refused to do so with previous contracts for the likes of Gavi and Ronald Araujo. Barcelona are confident of finalising a deal for Messi, as well as resolving other issues. But, to pursue a deal for Silva, they are going to have to raise funds. That means player sales and whilst they could cahs in on Frenkie De Jong and Ousmane Dembele, it does highlight that a Silva transfer is going to be difficult to pull off in the circumstances. It is understood that if Barcelona are not able to agree terms, Silva won't otherwise push to leave City and will stay in Manchester. Indeed, City sources have also not ruled out tying him to a new deal, if a switch to Camp Nou does not materialise."
Paulo Dybala offered to Premier League sides as bargain release clause kicks in,"May 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/paulo-dybala-offered-to-premier-league-sides-as-bargain-release-clause-kicks-in,"Paulo Dybala has been offered to a number of Premier League sides this summer as a bargain release clause in his Roma contract becomes active, 90min understands. The 29-year-old joined on a free transfer from Juventus last summer and has enjoyed a successful year under Jose Mourinho, racking up 16 goals and eight assists in 34 appearances and helping inspire Roma to the Europa League semi-finals. Dybala's contract contains a handful of release clauses - â¬20m for fellow Serie A clubs and just â¬12m for overseas teams - and sources have confirmed to 90min that the Argentine's representatives have been making sure clubs in the Premier League are aware. Indeed, 90min understands that Dybala's potential availability has been communicated to Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Manchester United, Newcastle and Tottenham. While none of the English sides have immediately dismissed the offer, there are long-standing concerns that Dybala is not interested in a move to the Premier League and any efforts to sign him would ultimately prove futile. Even if a club does trigger Dybala's release clause, the final decision will rest with the 29-year-old. feed Dybala has been of interest to clubs in England for a number of years now, with his departure from Juventus on a free transfer last summer seen as an opportunity for a real bargain, and while any suitor would have to pay a fee to sign the forward this summer, there is an awareness that â¬12m still represents incredible value. There is, however, a potential stumbling block when it comes to Dybala's significant wages, which could ultimately price some of the Premier League sides out of a move. Roma boss Mourinho recently admitted that Dybala is good enough to play for 'the biggest clubs in the world' but urged the Argentine to put his happiness first. ""My feeling is that he was seeking the joy, he had lost more than confidence,"" Mourinho told Sky Sport Italia. ""He found it here. He has found a coach who understands him, a crowd that loves him and a space on the field in which to be a leader with his quality and personality. ""Dybala is a nice boy. He has the quality to play for the biggest clubs in the world, but he has found joy here."""

'It's good to see' - Jurgen Klopp takes aim at Chelsea's failed rebuild,"Apr 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/good-to-see-jurgen-klopp-takes-aim-chelsea-failed-rebuild,"Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp believes that Chelsea's struggles this season prove that overseeing a rebuild is about more than simply buying lots of expensive players. The Blues have struggled to build on the success of the Roman Abramovich era under new owners Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital. After a record-summer transfer window spend of over Â£270m, Chelsea replaced fan-favourite manager Thomas Tuchel with Graham Potter. Further big-money transfers followed in January to create a seriously bloated squad - one that was literally too big for some of Chelsea's Cobham training facilities - and Potter fell victim to these manic changes with his sacking in April. Frank Lampard has lost all five of his games in caretaker charge of Chelsea, who now sit 12th in the table and still have to play all of the Premier League's current top four before the end of the season. Klopp's Liverpool have also endured a disappointing season with their own squad in need of refreshing, but in an interview with Sky Sports, the German coach felt vindicated that spending vast sums of money will not always provide a cure to such turmoil. ""I feel a little bit for Chelsea to be honest, because it's not going well. I think they're a top, top team but on the other side, it's good to see that you cannot just bring top players together and think it works out,"" he said. ""You have to build a team and that's what the guys there underestimated and gave their coaches a nearly impossible job to do. ""You cannot have two dressing rooms, you cannot train on two pitches, you have to create relationships, you have to create team spirit, and thatâs the only reason why I'm a little bit happy about it."" manual Klopp added: ""Chelsea will be fine in the end and they will be incredibly strong next year, but I'm using them just as an example. ""At the highest level, no, we cannot do it like that. And that's what we [Liverpool' will not do. ""You have to bring in the right players and build a new team. This team wrote a sensational story and now we start a new one, that's it.""

""There is a lot of concrete interest and I have made agreements with Ajax. feed ""Last year, Ajax asked me to stay for at least one more season and to extend my contract. As a club boy, I did that with love, but after this season we will review the situation. ""When I'm with the Dutch national team, I often talk to guys who play football abroad. I want to take that step someday. But when that is, you will find out eventually and it will happen in consultation with Ajax. ""I'm still here and I'm in no hurry. The focus is now on the cup final and the remainder of the season."" United want to strengthen in defence this summer to provide more competition for Raphael Varane and Timber's former Ajax teammate, Lisandro Martinez. Monaco's Axel Disasi and Bayern Munich's Benjamin Pavard are among those to have been watched by United but sources put Timber towards the top of the Red Devils' wishlist ahead of the summer window."

""There is still time, but there will have to be departures of players and a decrease in the wage bill. There will have to be if they are to be able to register Messi. feed ""And then there is a piece of information which we don't know, the salary of Messi. There are still many variables to understand. ""Barca is not like PSG, which has a gas and money tap to have a large salary mass. They have to reduce the salary mass to be able to sign up players. It's like the subway, let them out so they can get in. People still have to get out of the subway.""

With Watford set for another season in the Championship, Brighton have moved quickly to take advantage and agree a fee worth over Â£25m to land Pedro, who will become the Seagulls' record signing if he seals his move as expected, eclipsing the Â£20.7m paid for Enock Mwepu in 2021. Club officials were keen to move quick to fend off interest from rival Premier League sides. Newcastle attempted to land Pedro in the January transfer window but, while still on their radar, he has not been identified as a primary target for the summer. Brighton's interest in the 21-year-old has been driven by manager Roberto De Zerbi, who will be heavily involved in the team's summer transfer plans after an outstanding maiden campaign in the Premier League. feed Primarily a central striker, Pedro has also played on both wings for Watford and even turned out at the top of the Hornets' midfield, with this versatility likely to help him fit in under De Zerbi. Brighton sold Leandro Trossard to Arsenal during the January transfer window and declined to replace him immediately, but Pedro is now expected to fill the Belgian's spot in the squad. There could be further movement at the AMEX Stadium this summer as Brighton anticipate the departure of midfielder Alexis Mac Allister, who is of serious interest to a number of Premier League clubs and is expected to be granted a summer exit.

He came through Los Blancos' academy before a move to Leganes in 2018 and may be handed the opportunity to return this summer.

Lukaku has seen his time back at San Siro, having traded Inter for Chelsea in 2021, hampered by injuries. But the Belgian striker has started to gain some form since February and has contributed six direct goal involvements in his last eight Serie A starts.

Any such arrangement could see Lukaku defer some of his wages in order to stay on. 90min understands that Inter see the sudden suggestions of Lukaku potentially having a future at Chelsea next season as an attempt by the Blues to demonstrate that the 29-year-old does have more options than simply remaining in Milan. Chelsea are yet to make a decision and their next permanent manager will be part of that process. 90min reported earlier on Wednesday that a deal has been agreed in principle with Mauricio Pochettino following negotiations in recent days. Talks now continue over the make up of his backroom staff, with the Argentine looking to take his usual team to Stamford Bridge."

Kepa and Mendy are both available for transfer and are not in Chelsea's long-term plans, even if their new manager - expected to be Mauricio Pochettino - likes them.

Current Premier League table, top scorers & upcoming fixtures manual âHe would be missed by any club, so any club who didnât have him would miss him and we certainly would, partly because he is a big part. âBut my hope somewhere is that Dec thinks this is the best place for him to be and if somebody doesnât come up with the right amount of money, it will continue to be the place he is as well. The club have made that pretty plain, but I hope we can continue to get the best out of Dec.""  Rice has made no secret of his desire to play Champions League football, stating as such during last year's World Cup. âOne hundred per cent I want to play in the Champions League. For the last two or three years Iâve been saying that. Iâve been playing consistently well for my club and I feel like I really want to keep pushing.

He celebrates with the supporters, he talks to them, he is with them, in the dressing room he leads the team. If there is one thing you say about Declan Rice, whether he leaves or stays, he has been 100 per cent committed this year.â"

Barcelona 'leaving no stone unturned' to finalise dream Lionel Messi return,"Apr 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-leaving-no-stone-unturned-finalise-lionel-messi-return,"Barcelona are 'leaving no stone unturned' in their bid to re-sign Lionel Messi, but a deal will not be straightforward to complete, sources have told 90min. 90min revealed back in October that Barcelona were 'exploring' ways to bring Messi back to Camp Nou and there's been a growing belief in recent weeks that a return to the club he previously served for 21 years is likely to happen. Indeed, direct contact with Messi's representatives is ongoing and an agreement is close to being reached between the two parties. Messi's current deal at Paris Saint-Germain expires in the summer, and although the Ligue 1 giants have an option to extend by a further year, the contract clause can only be triggered with the 35-year-old's agreement - something he has been unwilling to sanction. PSG's priority was to re-sign Messi to a new contract following Argentina's World Cup success in Qatar, but despite holding talks, the club were kept waiting by the player's camp and were never able to come to an agreement. 90min revealed at the start of April that PSG had all but given up on Messi agreeing a new deal, which paved the way for Barcelona to push ahead with talks. Messi's father, Jorge, has been in constant contact with Barca officials in recent months, including president Joan Laporta, who has never hidden his desire to bring him back to the club. 90min also understands that Barcelona have promised Messi he can take back his old number ten shirt, which currently belongs to Ansu Fati. Laporta is now working hard to complete a deal which will need to be approved by La Liga. However, La Liga president Javier Tebas has already warned the club that big efforts must be made to get any deal through. ""Barca must take many financial measures to undertake Messiâs registration. They need lot of effort to make it happen. Today I don't see his signing as feasible. But thereâs a lot of time left, Barca can still make moves to get Leo. We are still awaiting a feasibility plan from Barcelona. They need a big effort to make it happen,"" Tebas stated earlier this month. feed 90min understands that Barcelona are exploring all possible options to get a deal for Messi through, and an avenue they are evaluating is employing Messi not just as a player, but also as part of the club's hierarchy and maybe even as a board member. This is not a negotiation tactic without precedent. When looking at a possible Cristiano Ronaldo deal last summer, Sporting CP explored making him a part owner of the club, and while that is not an option for Barca and Messi, they do believe the possibility of him being part of the club's off-field business could help off-set his playing contract. Sources have told 90min that although a deal is complicated, 'no stone is being left unturned' by Barcelona to make sure they bring Messi back to the club, but also to ensure that his contract is approved by the authorities. Barcelona have been left hugely annoyed by La Liga's refusal to sanction some of the moves they made last summer such as the handling of Gavi and Ronald Araujo's contracts. They don't want a repeat of those situations with any summer transfers, including Messi. As well as Messi, Barca are also in talks with a number of other players such as Manchester City's Ilkay Gundogan, but they know that in order to push through their plans, then changes to the current squad are going to have to be made. 90min understands that while Barca consider and insist that the likes of Frenkie De Jong and Ousmane Dembele are 'unsellable', the message coming from the very top is that all options will be considered - if that means some star players need to be sold, then so be it. De Jong is a long-term target of Manchester United and could be their most sellable asset if they allow him to leave, while Dembele, who has just over 12 months left on his current deal, is of interest to a number of Premier League clubs and could be sacrificed to facilitate a return to Catalonia for Messi.

Beyond Barcelonaâs very public confidence of securing a reunion, 90min reported earlier this month that PSG accept a new deal with Messi is unlikely. A return to Camp Nou, where he spent 21 years until the summer of 2021, is now the more likely outcome. Talks with Barcelona are planned and Messi himself has spent time in the city over the last few days,  spotted out for dinner with former teammates Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba on Monday. Even turning 36 at his next birthday in June, Messi would undoubtedly strengthen Barcelona, already set to win La Liga ahead of Real Madrid this season.

Itâs not an issue for me,â the Real coach said. âI like him as a player. For Spanish football it could be nice to have him.

The 32-year-old Spaniard has been in talks with United since last year about a new deal, with his current contract due to expire at the end of this season. United have an option to trigger an automatic one-year extension on his current terms, but have not utilised it - and have instead looked to agree a wage reduction with De Gea from his current Â£375,000-a-week earnings. De Gea is currently United's highest paid player and United have been looking to address their wage structure in recent months. De Gea has now agreed to take a substantial pay cut in order to prolong his stay at Old Trafford.

Only finer details remain to be ironed out. feed United manager Erik ten Hag has made it clear to the club's hierarchy that a new deal for De Gea was the best option at this point, with other areas of the squad seen as a priority to strengthen ahead of next season over a new starting goalkeeper. 90min has however learned that signing a goalkeeper to provide more substantial competition for De Gea should not be ruled out in 2023. De Gea has endured difficult moments this season - none more so than in last week's Europa League defeat against Sevilla - but is leading the Premier League's clean sheet table this season and has received public backing a number of times from his manager.

De Gea reacted to the loss in Europe with an excellent display in the FA Cup semi-final victory over Brighton and the United boss was quick to praise his number one. âI was very impressed with him, he made some brilliant saves. It hurt when he made mistakes on Thursday. Often when you make mistakes as a keeper you get punished. We let him down, we didnât fight back for him,â he said.

Sesko, currently of RB Salzburg, scored in a 2-0 away win for his side over Sturm Graz, their closest rivals for the championship in the Austrian Bundesliga, and has hit eight goals in his last seven league appearances. Only turning 20 on May 31, Sesko has been on the radar of a number of European giants - including the two Premier League clubs - for a number of months, though he is scheduled to join Salzburg's sister club RB Leipzig at the end of the season. A â¬24m deal was agreed in 2022 between the two clubs, at a below market rate due to their relationship. As 90min reported in October, that hasn't stopped some of the continent's biggest clubs from exploring the possibility of a deal before the start of the 2023/24 season. Leipzig stand to make a handsome profit on the â¬24m they have committed to sign Sesko even before he kicks a ball for the club due to the interest being shown in him if they decide to negotiate. The benefit in exchange for the potential buyer would be paying a more affordable price before Sesko develops into what many in the game consider to be one of the next leading strikers in Europe. His career path and frame have led to inevitable comparisons with Erling Haaland, who himself came through the Red Bull system and played for Salzburg.

United, meanwhile, are very publicly in the market for a new centre forward, with interest in Tottenham's Harry Kane and Napoli's Victor Osimhen established and well-documented. Both players however would demand significant transfer fees to acquire, so United are monitoring strikers who fit into two different brackets as it stands. Kane and Osimhen, along with Dusan Vlahovic and Lautaro Martinez, of Juventus and Inter respectively, are considered more expensive options considered ""ready to go"" and able to nail down the centre forward role from the start of next season. Kane and Osimhen in particular are considered difficult deals to do, but are being explored. The second bracket of striker is filled with younger options, or ""project players"", with potentially cheaper transfer fees but room for improvement. Sesko fits into that category, while Ajax's Mohammed Kudus, who 90min reported United hold interest in in January, is still being considered. Atalanta's Rasmus Hojlund, Benfica's Goncalo Ramos and Feyenoord's Santiago Gimenez also feature. United are exploring their options at present and pondering how to proceed, with central midfield, centre half and goalkeeper among the positions they are also looking at strengthening before next season."

He played an integral role in Benfica's triumph in the 2021/22 UEFA Youth League, a competition Chelsea know very well, by scoring four goals and assisting a further five to steer the Portuguese side to their first ever win in the tournament.

Chelsea hatch new plan to keep Liverpool target Mason Mount at Stamford Bridge,"Apr 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-new-plan-to-keep-liverpool-target-mason-mount-stamford-bridge,"Chelsea are prepared to offer a short-term contract extension to Mason Mount in an attempt to end the immediate uncertainty over his future at the club, 90min understands. Mount is approaching the final 12 months of his current deal and has long been warned that he will be sold this summer if he continues to reject the offer of fresh terms, with the vast majority of the Premier League's elite all keen to sign the 24-year-old if he does leave. As 90min revealed earlier this month, Chelsea have a renewed sense of confidence over Mount's future. While there is still an awareness that an extension is a long way away, the decision-makers at Stamford Bridge believe things are trending in the right direction. A large part of Chelsea's optimism relates to their search for a new manager. Sources have confirmed that Mauricio Pochettino is close to becoming the new Blues boss and the feeling is that this sign of ambition will help convince Mount to stay. However, to boost their chances of keeping Mount, Chelsea are also prepared to offer a short-term extension of one or two years to the academy graduate, which would bring an end to the immediate concerns of an exit and earn Chelsea time to win Mount over. feed Liverpool are seen as the biggest threat to Chelsea's hopes of keeping Mount, with the Reds keen to get a deal done after accepting defeat in their pursuit of Borussia Dortmund's Jude Bellingham, whose â¬150m price tag could be more than double Chelsea's asking price for Mount if he does hit the market. Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle all hold an interest in Mount, as do Bayern Munich following the arrival of former Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel. Chelsea have not given up hope of keeping Mount and will retain their dialogue with the 24-year-old and his representatives as the season approaches its finale with a view to solving one of their biggest dilemmas of the summer. While the Blues do appreciate the money they could raise by cashing in on Mount, there is a belief that there are plenty of other players who could be sold to bring in the necessary money. A significant number of players are unsettled and facing uncertain futures at Stamford Bridge and Chelsea are prepared to listen to offers, especially for those approaching the final two years of their contracts."
Romelu Lukaku sends message to Chelsea over Inter future,"Apr 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/romelu-lukaku-sends-message-chelsea-inter-future,"Romelu Lukaku has hinted that he is intent on staying at Inter beyond the expiration of his current loan move to the club.  The Belgian striker is currently on loan at I Nerazzurri for the 2022/23 season from Chelsea, having struggled for form during his return to Stamford Bridge for a reported Â£97.5m. Lukaku scored just eight Premier League goals for the Blues before being shipped out on loan back to Inter - the club Chelsea signed him from in 2021.  The hope was that Lukaku could re-find the form he showed at Inter during his previous two-year spell at San Siro, when he scored 64 goals to lead the club to a Serie A title.  That hasn't proven to be the case however, as the forward has continued to struggle in front of goal - scoring just five Serie A goals this season thus far.

Read the latest Champions League news here feed Lukaku was asked by Sky Sport Italia about his future after the game and he confessed that he wants to stay with the club for the foreseeable future. ""I have an excellent relationship with the fans and Iâve always tried to give everything for Inter because it gave me the opportunity to win two years ago,"" he began. ""This club has allowed me to become who I am today. âYes [I want to stay at Inter], but guys you have to pay attention to those things because the others [talk]. My goal is to give my best for Inter.""  At the end of February, Inter's CEO Giuseppe Marotta confirmed that Lukaku is set to return to Chelsea at the end of the 2022/23 season, but the club will assess their options regarding a future transfer or an extension of his current loan deal in the summer:  ""Talking about [Lukaku staying] is premature, at the moment we have the goal of finishing the season in the best possible way, then we will have to think about the hypotheses for next year,"" Marotta toldÂ Sky Sport Italia."

Since making the move to Bavaria however, Mazraoui has struggled for game-time under both Julian Nagelsmann and new manager Thomas Tuchel, being restricted to just 20 appearances in all competitions with just 10 of those coming from the start. As such, sources have told 90min that the player's representatives have begun to gauge interest from other clubs ahead of a potential summer move.  READ MORE FROM THE 90MIN TALKING TRANSFERS TEAM feed Manchester United, Newcastle United, Wolves, Arsenal, West Ham United and Crystal Palace are among the clubs to have been alerted to the Moroccan's potential availability, and will be kept informed of his situation at Bayern Munich in the coming weeks and months. Outside of the Premier League, we understand that Inter, Borussia Dortmund and Atletico Madrid have also been told about Mazraoui's potential availability. The full-back himself, following the club's Champions League exit at the hands of Manchester City, vented his frustration at his lack of playing time, saying: ""I was a starter here before the World Cup. Now Iâm fit and donât get any game time. ""I'm not even second or third choice. It's too early to talk about my perspective here - but it's not good!"" LISTEN NOW"
Bayern Munich president confirms striker pursuit amid Harry Kane interest,"Apr 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-president-confirms-striker-pursuit-amid-harry-kane-interest,"Bayern Munich president Herbert Hainer has confirmed that one of the club's main priorities this summer will be to sign a star striker, with Harry Kane on their shortlist. The Bavarians were eliminated at the quarter-final stage of the UEFA Champions League for a third successive season on Wednesday night, succumbing to a 4-1 aggregate defeat to Manchester City. Part of Bayern's problems have been that they have been unable to replace the goals and general all-round presence of Robert Lewandowski, who left to join Barcelona last summer. Veteran journeyman Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting has played up top this season and to his credit has scored 17 goals in 29 games, but Bayern's other options have been limited to using wide men like Sadio Mane and Serge Gnabry through the middle. READ MORE FROM THE 90MIN TALKING TRANSFERS TEAM feed Speaking after Wednesday's game with Man City, Hainer admitted that the lack of a centre forward is a clear tactical weakness that they will look to rectify. ""It was obvious we didn't have a number nine who would change things up front,"" he said. ""You can assume that we'll strengthen our squad to be able to compete in the league and Champions League ""We're missing a striker who can put the ball in the net. That's something we'll certainly need in future. If you can name me someone who can be an immediate hit, we would buy him immediately."" Bayern first made their interest in Kane known last summer when then-manager Julian Nagelsmann publicly revealed his admiration of the striker, even though Tottenham's demands would likely prove too costly for a transfer pursuit. Nevertheless, 90min understands that Bayern remain in the hunt for Kane with his contract set to expire in 2024. Kane will reassess his stance over a new deal with Spurs once the club appoint a permanent successor to Antonio Conte. LISTEN NOW"

Messi's contract at Paris Saint-Germain expires at the end of the season and a new deal is not close. 90min understands that PSG have accepted that the Argentine is likely to leave following a two-year stint in France, with talks over a return to Barcelona planned. Messi left Camp Nou in 2021 as they were unable to register his contract under strict financial rules implemented by La Liga following the coronavirus pandemic. Barcelona's finances are still in a rather sorry state, activating several 'levers' and mortgaging club assets in order to spend a bit more freely in the transfer market. READ MORE FROM THE 90MIN TALKING TRANSFERS TEAM feed And Tebas has said that BarÃ§a still need to make a few more concessions before they would be able to re-register Messi.

But there's a lot of time left - BarÃ§a can still make moves to get Leo. We are still awaiting a feasibility plan from Barcelona. They need a big effort to make it happen. They can sell players, for sure - but they still have some players to register too.""

PSG ready to enter race to sign Harry Kane,"Apr 19, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-ready-enter-race-sign-harry-kane,"Paris Saint-Germain would be interested in signing Harry Kane from Tottenham Hotspur this summer should he look to leave north London, 90min understands. Kane's contract at Spurs expires in 2024, though the club are confident of tying their vice-captain down to a new deal. Sources have told 90min talks will resume once the club appoint a permanent head coach to succeed Antonio Conte. Top clubs are continuing to circle Kane in the meantime, with Manchester United eyeing a move for the 29-year-old. Kane has his eyes set on breaking Alan Shearer's record for Premier League goals, but Bayern Munich are ready to offer him a route out of England should his desire to win trophies slightly outweigh his ambition and they believe they can lure him to mainland Europe. 90min also understands PSG are ready to reignite their interest in Kane should he be open to a move abroad. Club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has always admired the striker, with PSG making their interest in Kane known when he wanted to leave Spurs back in 2021. 90min reported at the time that PSG were able to lean on the fact that Eurostar links and short flights meant Kane would be able to quickly travel to and from his London home, potentially even staying in the English capital and commuting to training and matches. PSG were then managed by ex-Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino, who formed an incredibly strong bond with Kane at Spurs after integrating him into the first-team - Pochettino has often credited Kane with saving his job after scoring a late winner against Aston Villa early in his north London tenure. Though Pochettino has since departed PSG, the Ligue 1 champions' interest remains and Kane could even reunite with another former manager in the French capital. Jose Mourinho is on PSG's shortlist of managers to replace Christophe Galtier should he leave at the end of the season. The Portuguese coach helped transform Kane from a pure number nine into one of the world's most complete forwards, winning the Premier League Playmaker Award at the end of the 2020/21 season.

The England international has developed into one of the Premier League's leading marksmen in recent months and has looked completely rejuvenated under Unai Emery during the second half of this season. With Aston Villa now pushing for a European place, they are looking to tie down Watkins for his prime years, and sources have confirmed to 90min that an agreement over a new contract is close. Watkins signed a five-year deal upon signing from Brentford in 2020 for a fee that could reach Â£33m. The likes of Arsenal, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur have all been linked with the 27-year-old, but he is very happy at Aston Villa and will soon affirm his commitment to them with a new contract. Watkins has gone from strength-to-strength since making his Premier League debut, registering double figures of goals in each of his three seasons in the top flight. READ MORE FROM THE 90MIN TALKING TRANSFERS TEAM feed Emery recently spoke of his love for Watkins in a recent press conference, revealing: ""The striker is very important to me. I spoke with [Watkins] at the beginning [of my time here] about the relationship. I told him I want the best of you and the way he is doing - practising, being humble to improve - this is the way. ""Then, he has a big career in his future. It's very important as well to try and speak about other players because he is not going to score if his teammates aren't helping him to do it.

Man City's stance on Kyle Walker future amid Aston Villa links,"Apr 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-city-stance-kyle-walker-future-aston-villa,"Manchester City are happy to let Kyle Walker see out the remainder of his current contract with the club, 90min understands, amid links to Aston Villa. Walker has fallen down the pecking order at the Etihad Stadium in recent weeks, with manager Pep Guardiola explaining that he is currently unable to play in his new 3-2-4-1 formation. ""He cannot do it. He will always have pace; Kyle at 60 years old will be the fastest player in this room. To play inside you have to have educated movements - he doesn't have every one of the characteristics,"" Guardiola admitted. ""He has played as a full-back coming inside in the past with four at the back. He has done really well but this shape of three at the back and two in the middle, he cannot do it.""

However, 90min understands that the former club of Walker's most interested in a reunion is boyhood side Sheffield United. Walker has made no secret of his love for the Blades, notably appearing as an analyst on BBC Sport's coverage of their famous FA Cup win against Spurs at the start of March. Sheffield United would love to bring Walker back to Bramall Lane if they win promotion to the Premier League - they are currently second in the Championship favourites and are expected to clinch the runners-up spot - and a return 'home' would appeal to the England international.

Newcastle interested in Barcelona winger Ousmane Dembele,"Apr 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/newcastle-interested-barcelona-winger-ousmane-dembele,"Newcastle United hold an interest in Ousmane Dembele after intermediariesÂ met with the playerâs camp during his recent trip to England, sources have told 90min. The Barcelona winger, who has just over a year remaining on his current contract, was a surprise attendee at Sunderland's Championship with clash with Sheffield United in March, when he visited friend Kyril Louis-Dreyfus, the former's chairman. Dembele is one of Barcelona's highest profile players, owing to his mega-money move to Camp Nou in 2017, but his career at the club has been dogged by numerous injury lay-offs. Indeed, the Frenchman has played just 120 La Liga games for Barca in close to six full seasons and has been sidelined with a hamstring issue since late January. Dembele's visit to the North East is understood to have only been short, but 90min understands that brief contact was made between the player's representatives and intermediaries representing Newcastle. The PIF-owned Magpies have adopted a relatively cautious approach to their transfer business to date - despite spending heavily on striker Alexander Isak - but qualification for next season's Champions League could accelerate their plans to land a number of elite signings this summer. The 25-year-old would certainly fit that bill and is attracted by the prospect of playing in the Premier League - he came close to joining Chelsea last summer before renewing his contract at Barcelona. feed In order to do so, Dembele took a wage cut in Catalonia - helping the club reduce their spiralling costs - but it's understood that any interest in an extension could be dependant on being offered a wage rise. As it stands, that's unlikely to be on the table from Barcelona, who have plans to re-sign Lionel Messi from Paris Saint-Germain as well as Manchester City captain Ilkay Gundogan and potentially Bernardo Silva. With Messi's fairytale return edging ever closer, Barcelona sources have confirmed to 90min that Dembele could be one of those who makes way, even though the club's hierarchy and manager Xavi think highly of him. The player himself would consider leaving if a suitable offer from Barcelona was not forthcoming, and is acutely aware that he has plenty of options around Europe, particularly in England. As well as Newcastle, Chelsea remain keen, while Arsenal and Manchester City have eyes on his situation.  Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain are also waiting in the wings in case a deal is there to be done."
Why Southampton are ready to sell Romeo Lavia amid Arsenal & Chelsea interest,"Apr 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/why-southampton-are-ready-to-sell-romeo-lavia-amid-arsenal-chelsea-interest,"Southampton are prepared to sell star midfielder Romeo Lavia this summer just one year after signing him from Manchester City, 90min understands. The Saints brought in the then-18-year-old after he had made just two senior appearances for Man City, but he has quickly blossomed into one of the Premier League's brightest young stars. Lavia made such a great immediate impression on the south coast that Chelsea lodged a bid to sign him late in the same summer window in which he joined Southampton. This approach was knocked back. Despite Lavia's progress, Southampton find themselves mired in the pits of a desperate relegation battle, currently propping up the Premier League table having accumulated only 23 points from 31 games. It is looking likely that Southampton will be playing Championship football next season, and among the star names expected to leave the club is Lavia. READ MORE FROM THE 90MIN TALKING TRANSFERS TEAM feed Sources have told 90min that Manchester City have a Â£40m buy-back option on Lavia which becomes active in 2024. Southampton are keen to do business for a potentially higher price this summer in order to maximise his value.

The Saints sit bottom of the table having picked up just 23 points from 31 games and are four points from safety having won just one of their last eight league games. Though relegation to the Championship is far from assured, it is a possibility that is looking far more probable by the week. Sources have told 90min that a number of key players - including Kyle Walker-Peters, Mohammed Salisu, Armel Bella-Kotchap and Romeo Lavia - are expected to leave St. Mary's if they go down. England international and set-piece extraordinaire Ward-Prowse is also prepared to part ways with the club he has represented since the age of eight. 90min understands that Southampton will demand around Â£50m for their club captain, who is the subject of interest from several top-flight sides. READ MORE FROM THE 90MIN TALKING TRANSFERS TEAM feed Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe and sporting director Dan Ashworth are both huge fans of Ward-Prowse. The Magpies are being kept informed of the player's developing situation on the south coast, though their summer business hinges on their final position in the standings - Newcastle currently sit fourth and are on course to qualify for the Champions League.

Joan Laporta teases Lionel Messi return to Barcelona,"Apr 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/joan-laporta-teases-lionel-messi-return-barcelona,"Barcelona president Joan Laporta continues to be openly confident that Lionel Messi will return to the club, having left Camp Nou for Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2021. Messi signed a two-year contract with PSG that is coming towards the end. That deal did include a further 12-month option, but the seven-time Ballon dâOr has been weighing things up all season. The 35-year-old is known to be happier in Paris than he was last season after taking some time to settle in the French capital, as 90min reported in February. PSG have been pushing for Messi to make a decision on his future, having already reached a broad agreement over a new one-year deal with an option until 2025. But there is no indication that Messi is ready to sign it and further talks were planned. Barcelona coach Xavi said earlier this year that the âdoors are openâ for Messi to return to Camp Nou and revealed the former teammates are in âconstant contactâ. Laporta, who took office as president for the second time in the final months of Messiâs time at the club, has also been very vocal on the subject virtually ever since the 2022 World Cup winner left. Now, in answering a few short questions from Cadena SER, he gave a firm âyesâ when asked if Messi will be heading back to Barcelona. 90min recently revealed that PSG have accepted Messi is not likely to extend his contract there. His father, Jorge, has been in Barcelona for talks this month. feed If Messi wanted to commit his future to PSG, he missed an opportunity to do just that in recent days when asked about what the next step for him is. âI donât know what my future holds,â Messi said, âAs I said at the beginning, itâs hard for me to imagine, to think about things that could happen but I really donât know what my future will be and it will be whatever it has to be, whatever God wants it to be, will be.â Messi had spent 21 years Barcelona by the time he left in 2021, almost two thirds of his entire life at that point after moving to La Masia aged just 13. He expressed a public desire to leave the club in 2020 in the wake of an embarrassing 8-2 humiliation by Bayern Munich in the Champions League. However, by 2021, he appeared to ready to re-commit and agreed a new contract. It was never signed, though, with Barcelonaâs much publicised financial problems responsible. Even with Messi happy to stay, the club desperate to keep him and the contract agreed, Barcaâs money woes meant there wasnât the funds to register it in line with La Liga spending rules. Spanish employment law prevented anything more than a 50% pay cut and the club couldnât afford it. Messi was backed into a corner and had no choice but to look elsewhere to continue his career."

The transfer revelation would have come as a surprise to the Anfield faithful who assumed their club had placed all attention on bringing the teen sensation to operate under Klopp. Their underwhelming season has put Jurgen Klopp under the cosh and the German tactician has set his sights on a significant overhaul. Let's scour the footballing world to see who may be en route to Anfield this summer. Englishman Mason Mount is likely to replace his countryman as Liverpool's priority acquisition this summer, as his hard-working nature fits Klopp's blueprint like a glove. Chelsea owner Todd Boehly has stated that he won't stand in the way of a potential deal which may entice Liverpool's higher-ups to enquire for the Cobham graduate. Liverpool are among a series of Premier League clubs who are interested in signing Chelsea and Croatian star Kovacic. Chelsea may feel inclinced to sell to sort out their financial status. This means it won't be simple to secure his signature and can Liverpool afford to be in a well-contested race when multiple additions are required? Maddison would bring a sense of leadership to Klopp's engine room and that sprinkled with his dangerous dead-ball ability, he'd be a sound addition to a department ladened with ageing, contract-running players. Leicester's most valuable asset has been due a move to one of the league's top sides and it's looking incredibly likely he will be plying his trade elsewhere at the start of the 2023/24 season. Struggling for minutes in Bavaria, the former Ajax midfielder could act as a low-cost alternative to some of the others on Klopp's shopping list. Pictured wearing a Liverpool top amid the interest from Anfield, the Reds faithful are rummaging around the internet to find compilations of the 20-year-old. Wolves' Portuguese ace has been earmarked by Liverpool as a cheaper Bellingham option and would bring top flight experience to a struggling midfield. The Molineux-based outfit have removed his transfer clause from the current deal he has tied up with the club, may hinder Liverpoolâs pursuit. A lack of Premier League experience may mean Klopp would place the Portuguese youngster low on his list of potential incomings.  He is only 23, however,  and would arrive with the aim of becoming a long-term servant for the Merseyside-based outfit. The 26-year-old midfielder will soon enter the final year on his Borussia Monchengladbach deal and so may be available to the German tactician for a realistic price. 90min recently revealed that Liverpool are interested in the player. However, Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal and Newcastle have all done scouting work on will continue watching. feed Though he was moments away to joining table topping Arsenal in the winter, Caicdeo signed a fresh deal with Brighton, which expires in 2027. For a plethora of reasons, it's probable the Ecuador international would cost a pretty penny and so, Liverpool are likely to steer clear of the Â£100m-valued player. Neverthless, securing his services would solve their midfield woes in an instance and would also provide sufficient cover for the long-term.  Adrien Rabiot has previously revealed his fondness for Liverpool, leaving fans with the hope that Anfield will be his next destination. Manchester United's failed approach, however, may mean they come back in for seconds upon the opening of the summer transfer window.  With a World Cup winners medal in a cabinet at home, he will be valued at a premium that Liverpool may shy away from, but what a pick up this would be! Mac Allister would thrive and inject Liverpool with some much-needed creativity, a player which Liverpool have lacked in abundance this campaign. Klopp and his staff should air on the side of caution when negotiating with Brighton as the well-run club may qualify for European football and therefore boost their likelihood of retaining their stars. Quickly establishing himself as one of the league's best holding midfielders, the Portuguese destroyer has received much interest from top clubs. You'd assume the Cottagers would ideally hang on to one of their most prized assets but when a club like Liverpool come calling, you typically answer.  The Belgian international, similarly to Maddison, has been one of Leicester's crucial players in moments where they are needed most - especially when facing a relegation battle. "
Ryan Gravenberch pictured in Liverpool shirt amid transfer interest,"Apr 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ryan-gravenberch-pictured-liverpool-shirt-transfer-interest,"A picture of Ryan Gravenberch wearing a Liverpool shirt has emerged days after being linked with a move to Anfield. Gravenberch opted to sign for Bayern Munich from Ajax last summer but has struggled for game time at the Allianz Arena, sitting firmly being Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka in the pecking order, while Konrad Laimer will join from RB Leipzig this summer. 90min reported earlier this week that Liverpool, as well as Arsenal and Manchester United, have been asked to be kept informed of developments on Gravenberch's future should be become available for transfer. With the Reds in the market for an alternative to Jude Bellingham after ending their pursuit of the Borussia Dortmund star, Gravenberch looks like he could be part of a viable solution to their problems. Social media sleuths have already worked their magic in finding any past connection of the Dutchman to Liverpool, digging up a picture of him donning a shirt from the 2019/20 season. Gravenberch in a Liverpool shirt ð pic.twitter.com/3jzu5Uxvzd While this image has only resurfaced this weekend, it was first bandied around in Liverpool circles in recent months.  pic.twitter.com/xPqWKn23h9 The shirt features the Club World Cup winners' badge and a patch for the FA Cup and is said to have been gifted to him by compatriot Ki-Jana Hoever, who spent two years at Liverpool. The picture originated from the Instagram page of Leandro Fernandes, who played with Gravenberch also played with at youth level with the Netherlands. Does this mean that Gravenberch is a Liverpool fan? Is he on his way to Merseyside as we speak? Is he singing 'Si Senor' and 'Oh Andy Andy' at the top of his lungs? No. Makes for a nice subplot at least, though. LISTEN NOW"

Gavi's senior contract with Barcelona was rescinded by La Liga and Spanish courts due to the club's unstable situation.

Man Utd & Bayern Munich target Harry Kane to wait on Tottenham contract decision,"Apr 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-bayern-munich-target-harry-kane-to-wait-tottenham-contract-decision,"Harry Kane and Tottenham Hotspur are willing to reassess negotiations over a new contract once the club appoint a new head coach, 90min understands. The England captain, who is a transfer target for both Manchester United and Bayern Munich, has just over a year remaining on his current deal and is yet to agree terms over an extension. 90min first revealed in May 2022 that Kane was willing to extend his stay at Spurs and he was very happy working under Antonio Conte, but the footballing landscape has changed a fair bit since then. Bayern Munich made their interest very public last summer to Conte's annoyance, while Tottenham have underperformed against expectations this season, leading to the Italian head coach's departure last month. It had been expected that Conte was not going to lead Spurs into the 2023/24 season, and 90min reported in March that the club's hierarchy were willing to involve Kane in the decision-making process behind hiring a new head coach as part of their attempts to convince him to stay. 90min now understands that Kane will reassess his stance once a permanent successor to Conte has been appointed, and while Tottenham have long been confident that their all-time record scorer will stay in north London, they will not push him for a decision until a new head coach is in the dugout. Burnley boss Vincent Kompany is being considered by Spurs, though ex-Bayern Munich manager Julian Nagelsmann and Brighton's Roberto De Zerbi are currently unconvinced by the prospect of taking over. During Tottenham's 2-1 win against Brighton last week, home fans loudly chanted the name of former manager Mauricio Pochettino, who would be interested in taking the job but would prefer to wait until the summer to decide his own future. Luis Enrique, who has held talks with Chelsea this month over their vacancy, is another target for Tottenham.

Manchester United also retain a firm interest in Kane, though are adamant they will not be dragged into a bidding war or a protracted transfer saga. They also believe that Spurs chairman Daniel Levy would make negotiations very difficult even if Kane were to dig his heels in.

The three Premier League giants are all expected to make changes in defence this summer and have been following a whole host of potential signings as they seek to whittle down their centre-back shortlists. Sources have confirmed that scouts from all three have been to watch Disasi in recent weeks. The 25-year-old, who made three appearances for France at the 2022 World Cup, has long been touted as a future star in Ligue 1 and has been an integral part of a Monaco side pushing for Champions League qualification. It is understood that Chelsea, City and United were all impressed by Disasi but their interest in the defender is only in its early stages and there are no guarantees any of the three clubs will take their tracking of him any further.

Jurgen Klopp explains Liverpool's Jude Bellingham transfer decision,"Apr 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jurgen-klopp-explains-liverpool-jude-bellingham-transfer-decision,"Jurgen Klopp has admitted Liverpool have been forced to accept defeat in their pursuit of Borussia Dortmund midfielder Jude Bellingham. Liverpool have been working on a deal to sign the England international for years but have been forced to pull out of a race which is growing far too expensive for a side with limited resources and significant transfer needs elsewhere in the squad. Dortmund, if they do sell Bellingham this summer, are expected to demand a fee of at least â¬150m which, added to wages and agents fees, have seen Liverpool step aside, leaving Manchester City and Real Madrid as the likeliest destinations for the 19-year-old. Asked about Liverpool's decision, Klopp told Friday's press conference: ""There's nothing to say about it to be honest. If we don't speak about players we are signing or not signing, why would we now speak about this kind of speculation? Really nothing to say.""

Chelsea confident they can sign Victor Osimhen without offer of Champions League football,"Apr 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-confident-they-can-sign-victor-osimhen-without-champions-league-football,"Chelsea are confident they can win the race for Napoli striker Victor Osimhen even without the allure of Champions League football next season, 90min understands. As revealed in February, Chelsea have made Osimhen their top striker target for 2023 after months of scouting the Nigeria international, and club officials are preparing what will likely be a club-record bid to take the 24-year-old to Stamford Bridge. Osimhen, who has 21 goals in 23 games for Serie A leaders Napoli this season, is also on the radars of Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United, who are all understood to have made contact with the striker's representatives. However, sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea believe they can outbid their rivals and convince Osimhen to move to London even without the promise of Champions League football next season. Moving to England's capital city is of interest to Osimhen but so too is the chance to follow in the footsteps of his childhood idol, Ivorian striker Didier Drogba, who is fondly remembered as one of Chelsea's all-time greatest players. feed Chelsea believe Osimhen would want to move to Stamford Bridge even without European football and the Blues are also prepared to blow other clubs out of the water with a huge club-record bid for the striker. Manchester United remain in contact with Osimhen's entourage but are currently focused on signing Tottenham striker Harry Kane alongside Bayern, who would not be prepared to pay the same sort of money as Chelsea in pursuit of the Nigerian. As for PSG, uncertainty over the future of manager Christophe Galtier means the French side's interest in Osimhen is nowhere near as advanced as that of Chelsea, who have been working behind the scenes for months. Sources close to Chelsea remain confident that they will be able to recruit Osimhen, whose arrival would be partly funded by a number of sales. The likes of Conor Gallagher, Kai Havertz, Christian Pulisic and Hakim Ziyech are among the most high-profile names who could leave Stamford Bridge this summer. Mason Mount is also a candidate to be sold this summer if he continues to decline a contract extension, but Chelsea hold renewed confidence about securing the midfielder's future ahead of a fresh round of talks. The Blues are keen to overhaul their struggling forward line and have already wrapped up a deal for RB Leipzig's Christopher Nkunku, but the Frenchman is seen as a better fit for the position behind a central striker and so Chelsea want to team him up with Osimhen.

Barcelona close to Ilkay Gundogan deal as Man City contract nears expiry,"Apr 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-close-ilkay-gundogan-deal-man-city-contract-nears-expiry,"Barcelona are close to agreeing a deal with Manchester City captain Ilkay Gundogan, who is out of contract this summer, 90min understands. City have not given up hope that the 32-year-old will extend his stay at the reigning Premier League champions, but sources have confirmed to 90min that the club will not look to force the issue with Gundogan because of his outstanding service over the years. Gundogan's representatives have been talking to Barcelona for a number of months, while 90min reported in October on Bayern Munich's longstanding interest in the German, who previously played for their Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund. Paris Saint-Germain have also been in contact with his team. City manager Pep Guardiola acknowledged in February that Gundogan ""can do whatever he wants"" after scoring twice on the final day of the 2021/22 Premier League season - goals that earned the Citizens a breathtaking, title-winning three points against Aston Villa. The Spaniard also said that Gundogan ""has the paradise already"" and that ""he knows exactly my opinion about him"", strongly hinting that he'd like his captain to remain at the club. But 90min understands that although further talks with Barcelona have not yet yielded a formal agreement, the Catalan giants are closing in on a deal for Gundogan. feed A move to Camp Nou this summer would end Gundogan's seven-year association with Manchester City, which has seen him win four Premier League titles and seven domestic cup competitions. He has played close to 300 games in all competitions for the club, scoring some momentous goals over the years while playing as a box-to-box midfielder. Gundogan's potential arrival at Barcelona would boost the depth of Xavi's soon-to-be crowned La Liga champions, with the club looking to reposition themselves as a force in the Champions League after back-to-back early exits in the competition. Barcelona's financial troubles are well documented, so the opportunity to sign a player of Gundogan's calibre on a free transfer is inevitably one that appeals - the club concluded similar deals for Franck Kessie, Andreas Christensen and Marcos Alonso for the same reasons over the course of this season. The Catalan giants also hope to persuade Lionel Messi to complete a fairytale return to the club, two years after he departed for Paris Saint-Germain because of the same financial issues that continue to plague the club."

Chelsea's renewed optimism comes as another blow to suitors Liverpool, who have identified Mount as a top midfield target after accepting defeat in the race to sign Borussia Dortmund midfielder Jude Bellingham. Liverpool lodged their interest with Mount's representatives early on amid fears that a change in Chelsea's direction could alter their stance in negotiations with the 24-year-old, and Jurgen Klopp's side will now face a nervous wait to see whether Chelsea can finally get an agreement over the line.

The Dutch midfielder signed for Bayern last summer from Ajax, but has found his first season in Bavaria difficult - playing only 323 minutes to date in their Bundesliga campaign. He was left on the bench for the entirety of Bayern's 3-0 Champions League defeat to Manchester City on Tuesday. Gravenberch is understood to have never won over now former manager Julian Nagelsmann, and is at the moment unclear how he fits into the plans of new Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel. Leon Goretzka and Joshua Kimmich are Bayern's first choice players in central midfield and the club are also set to sign Konrad Laimer from RB Leipzig on a free transfer, making competition even greater. Gravenberch is looking for a path to regular first team football and is set to analyse his chances of a long-term role at Bayern in the final weeks of the season. All three Premier League clubs are looking to upgrade their options in midfield, with different profiles of player being considered by each. feed United are looking for a ball-playing number eight, and have had Frenkie de Jong of Barcelona in mind since Erik ten Hag's arrival. 90min also reported in recent weeks of exploratory interest in Mateo Kovacic, who is out of contract with Chelsea in 2024. Orkan Kokcu of Feyenoord has also been watched of late. Ten Hag has worked with Gravenberch before at Ajax, and introduced him to the club's first team. Liverpool meanwhile are looking sign up to three midfielders over the summer, and have withdrawn from the race to sign number one target Jude Bellingham due to prohibitive cost. They instead prefer to spread their summer budget over multiple, cheaper options. Chelsea's Mason Mount has also been of strong interest to Jurgen Klopp, while other targets are being considered from Premier League clubs - Matheus Nunes, Ruben Neves, Moises Caicedo and Alexis Mac Allister among them. Gravenberch is also being considered by Klopp having been a previous Liverpool target and a relatively cheap acquisition should Bayern decide to cash in. Fiorentina's Sofyan Amrabat is also among Liverpool's targets. Liverpool's desire to recruit so many players for one area of the pitch inevitably means several players are profiled and analysed. Arsenal meanwhile tried to sign Caicedo in January, only to be put off by Brighton's lofty valuation of the Ecuadorian midfielder. Youri Tielemans of Leicester City, out of contract at the end of the season, has also been considered by the Gunners and may become an option.

Bellingham is due to make his decision but as it stands, if he was to leave this summer it would be a straight choice between Real and City. Both sides are willing to sanction a deal which would be one of the largest deals in football history.  Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea have both contacted Bellinghamâs representatives too, and while they would be able to match any offer, 90min understands that neither are being considered as realistic landing spots at this time.Â  Should Bellingham decide to stay at Dortmund for another year and sign a new deal with a release clause, 90min has been told that ""all bets would be off"" for 2024.

The Magpies are on an upward trajectory and jumping aboard that ship would make sense given the two other clubs' need to rebuild.

Juventus & Napoli eye Rasmus Hojlund amid Dusan Vlahovic & Victor Osimhen exit rumours,"Apr 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/juventus-napoli-rasmus-hojlund-dusan-vlahovic-victor-osimhen-exit-rumours,"Juventus and SSC Napoli are among the clubs interested in young Atalanta striker Rasmus Hojlund, 90min understands. Hojlund has been one of the breakout stars of the 2022/23 Serie A season, becoming a key player for the Bergamo club by bagging an impressive seven goals in just 14 starts. The 20-year-old has also caught the eye with his performances for the Danish national team too, scoring five goals in just two Euro 2026 qualifiers already. The forward's form has, as expected, alerted some of the biggest clubs in Europe. 90min understands that two such clubs are Italian giants Juventus and Napoli.  Both clubs see Hojlund as a contingency plan if either of their current number nines leave this summer. Sources told 90min back in January that Juve's Vlahovic had been offered to a number of top clubs, including Manchester United, following the club's 15 point deduction due to financial mismanagement.  READ NEXT feed Said points deduction has made it improbable that Juve will qualify for the UEFA Champions League next season, a competition Vlahovic has ambitions of playing in.  Napoli are eying a move for Hojlund due to Chelsea making Victor Osimhen their 'top target' ahead of the summer window. Alarm bells were likely sounded at Stadio Diego Armando Maradona recently too when the striker confirmed that it is his 'dream' to play in the Premier League.   As well as the competition between one another, Juventus and Napoli could also face some from abroad too. 90min understands that Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United all sent scouts to watch Hojlund's Denmark debut - a game in which the striker scored a hat-trick against Finland - while Everton, Leicester City, Crystal Palace, West Ham, Bayern Munich and Marseille have all watched the player in recent months too.

Robert Lewandowski reveals he wanted to join Man Utd ,"Apr 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/robert-lewandowski-reveals-he-wanted-to-join-man-utd,"Robert Lewandowski has revealed he was keen to join Manchester United earlier in his career when he received a phone call direct from legendary Old Trafford Sir Alex Ferguson, only for Borussia Dortmund and Jurgen Klopp to block a potential move. Lewandowski had started rising through the Polish lower leagues from the age of 16, landing with top flight Lech Poznan in 2008 and scored 41 times in 82 appearances across all competitions. That paved the way for a move to Germany and Borussia Dortmund, with the young striker a regular in Kloppâs side that won the 2010/11 Bundesliga title. Although Lewandowski wasnât a prolific goalscorer at that stage of his career like he has since become, it appears that Fergie and United quickly saw his enormous potential. It was during Dortmundâs pre-season and he was 22 at the time, which places it around July 2011, when United were in need of a fresh injection up front and would sign Robin van Persie to spearhead their next Premier League title charge the following year. âI remember the moment exactly,â Lewandowski has now recalled in an interview with Sport Bild. âWe had a friendly with Dortmund in preparation, I think against Bochum. I was subbed at half-time. I looked at my mobile phone in the dressing room. There was a text message with the sender +44. Ferguson had tried to call me and then sent me a message. He wanted to talk to me. manual âI was still in the dressing room, I took a shower and called him back, in a quiet corner. My English wasnât as good as it is today. He has a strong Scottish accent. I was so focused on understanding what he meant! Alex Ferguson tried to be considerate, spoke slowly. âI was 22-years-old, it was a special moment. I spoke to Aki Watzke and Jurgen Klopp in the camp. I wanted to go to Man United! But they said: âNo chance, Robert. We need you. You have to stayâ.â Stay was exactly what he did do, with Lewandowski going onto score 30 goals in all competitions the next season for the first time in his career as Dortmund retained their title. A year later, he fired the club to the Champions League final, before a free transfer to Bayern Munich in 2014. In Bavaria, he seemed to get better with age and netted an astonishing 344 times in 375 games. Now, the veteran star is at Barcelona and has shown no signs of slowing down, despite playing in a new country for the first time in 12 years â 27 goals in 34 games tells its own story. But when Fergie called all those years ago, it wasnât actually the first time that an English club had made an attempt to buy Lewandowski. A volcanic ash cloud grounding flights in Europe was partly responsible for scuppering Blackburnâs chance to sign him direct from Poznan before Dortmund. A price tag of up to â¬4m was also an issue for the former Premier League champions, who were relegated in 2012 and havenât returned to the top flight since. A couple of months after Blackburn had been denied their meeting with Lewandowski, Dortmund signed him for â¬4.5m. âI think about it every time I see him play,â former Rovers manager Sam Allardyce remarked three years later. ""I think they wanted â¬3m or â¬4m, but we were particularly strapped financially at the time at Blackburn. I watched him play, but I didn't get the chance to meet him. I think his agent said he couldn't come over because of the ash cloud. ""There were a lot of people looking at him at that time as well, but we had the edge over everyone else because of the attraction of the Premier League. He could have used us as a stepping stone but it didn't happen."""
PSG accept Lionel Messi unlikely to extend contract | Further Barcelona talks planned,"Apr 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-accept-lionel-messi-unlikely-to-extend-contract-barcelona-talks-planned,"Paris Saint-Germain have accepted that Lionel Messi is unlikely to extend his contract in the French capital, 90min understands, with further talks planned between Barcelona and the Argentine's father. Messi's contract with PSG expires in the summer and talks have been ongoing throughout the year over a new deal.

Santiago Gimenez's recent form attracts several European giants,"Apr 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/santiago-gimenez-s-recent-form-attracts-several-european-giants-01gx6hcq21vs,"Several European teams are currently eyeing Feyenoord striker Santiago Gimenez after a standout first season with the Eredivisie club. In England, Leicester, Aston Villa, Brentford, Brighton and Crystal Palace stand among those keeping a close eye on Gimenez in the last couple of weeks, sources close to 90min can confirm. Clubs in France, Italy and Germany remain interested as well, specifically Lille, Frankfurt and Napoli. Gimenez adjusted quickly to the Dutch league, scoring 21 goals so far this season in all competitions. But it's his recent form - eight goals in his last 10 appearances and scoring in six consecutive Eredivisie away games - that has attracted European giants.Â  The consensus between certain teams hint that Gimenez would benefit from another year in the Eredivisie, sources add. But the fast-paced nature of the transfer market may impulse a potential move. Gimenez first joined Feyenoord in July 2022, signing a four-year contract to complete the transfer from Liga MXâs Cruz Azul. He has flourished under current manager Arne Slot, working through serving as an unused substitute to a vital component of the starting 11.

Wolves ready to make audacious offer for Real Madrid star,"Apr 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/wolves-ready-to-make-audacious-offer-for-real-madrid-star,"Wolverhampton Wanderers are ready to make an audacious bid for Real Madrid midfielder Dani Ceballos, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 26-year-old is out of contract this summer and is free to negotiate terms with interested parties over a potential move. Champions League holders Real, who will take on Chelsea in the quarter-finals of this year's edition, are in talks with Ceballos about extending his contract, but although the Spaniard is happy in Madrid and the club are confident about renewing, there are ongoing concerns about his playing time at the Bernabeu. Indeed, Real Madrid have a swathe of quality options in midfield - Toni Kroos, Luka Modric, Aurelien Tchouameni and Eduardo Camavinga to name just four - and they have a strong interest in signing Jude Bellingham from Borussia Dortmund. Ceballos has enjoyed a run in the first team of late, putting in a number of impressive performances, but he has never started more than 13 La Liga games in a season for Real since arriving from Real Betis in 2017. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Ceballos is again attracting interest from England, this time in the form of Wolves, who are looking to bolster their central midfield options and are managed by former Real Madrid boss Julen Lopetegui. feed Ceballos is known to be a player that Lopetegui admires - they spent a couple of months together during the latter's brief stint in the Spanish capital - and he could help fill the potential voids left by Ruben Neves and Matheus Nunes in midfield. The Portuguese pair are generating serious interest from elsewhere and could be allowed to leave Molineux so that Wolves can reinvest. 90min understands that Wolves are readying an approach for Ceballos, but are acutely aware that he'll need persuading to leave Real Madrid for a side who are still fighting to preserve their Premier League status - any move will obviously be dependant on Wolves achieving that goal. Atletico Madrid are also interested in signing Ceballos, while sources have confirmed that Real Betis would like to re-sign him. Eintracht Frankfurt and RB Leipzig are among his admirers in Germany, along with Ligue 1 duo Marseille and Monaco, and Serie A trio Juventus, Napoli and AC Milan are also thought to be keeping tabs on his situation."
"Man City, Man Utd & Real Madrid show interest in Benjamin Pavard","Apr 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-city-man-utd-real-madrid-show-interest-benjamin-pavard,"ManchesterÂ City, Manchester United and Real Madrid have all expressed an interest in Bayern Munich right-back Benjamin Pavard, sources have confirmed to 90min. Pavard has been considered one of Europeâs most talented full-backâs for a number of seasons, but his long-term future at Bayern is uncertain and he does have options away from Bavaria. City, United and Real are all looking at bolstering their options at right back in the coming months and Pavard has emerged as a very attractive option. Sources have told 90min that all three clubs are well aware of the state of play with Pavard, and have asked to be kept informed about his situation. Pavard has just over a year left on his current deal and Bayern are keen to open talks over an extension. But the Frenchman and hisÂ representatives have told the Bundesliga giants that they will wait until the summer before deciding what to do next, which is something the player confirmed publicly this week. ""There are currently no talks with the club, we're focused on our season goals,â Pavard said.Â ""I'm just trying to play my best football and win trophies. We'll see this summer.â Bayern recently dismissed Julian Nagelsmann as manager, which shocked Pavard and many of his teammates, but new boss Thomas Tuchel has wastedÂ little time in confirming his admiration for the 27-year-old. ""I don't want to get involved in negotiations. He's an underrated player,â Tuchel said. ""He can adapt at an extremely high level, defends with big discipline. He's a top team player. He immediately got my trust and justified it. That should be a clear statement.â feed Cityâs interest in Pavard is fascinating given they have one of their ownÂ full-back options at Bayern - Portugal international Joao Cancelo. He departed the Etihad in January on a loan deal with an option to buy this summer, but it remains to be seen whether that clause will be activated or not. Tuchel is a fan of Cancelo's though, and has already spoken favourably of his ability to play on both sides of defence. ""I love Joao, I've had to play against him many times,"" the German remarked. ""He has the absolute highest quality, left foot, right foot, passing. He's a different type of player than Benji Pavard. He can also play on the left in the back four."" City are obviously already in contact with Bayern about Cancelo, but United and Real can't be ruled out of the Pavard equation as they step up their own efforts to sign a new right-back. Erik ten Hag has overseen somewhat of a resurgence at United, despite some indifferent results away from home, and is looking to move on from Aaron Wan-Bissaka this summer. The Red Devils have been considering options for the last six months, with Ajaxâs Jurrien Timber, Bayer Leverkusenâs Jeremie Frimpong and Interâs Denzel Dumfries among those to have been considered, but Pavard is very much on the club's radar. Likewise, Real are also in contention for Pavard - should he decide to leave the Allianz this summer - as they look to upgrade on Spanish veteran Dani Carvajal."

Wayne Rooney describes similarities between Marcus Rashford & Harry Kane,"Apr 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/wayne-rooney-describes-similarities-marcus-rashford-harry-kane,"Manchester United's all-time record scorer Wayne Rooney has compared current forward Marcus Rashford with summer transfer target Harry Kane. Rashford is enjoying his best season in a United shirt to date, already racking up 27 goals in 44 games across all competitions and leading them to Carabao Cup glory. He has, however, had to shoulder the majority of the Red Devils' scoring load - Bruno Fernandes (10) is the only other player in the squad to have reached double figures for goals this term. 90min understands that a new centre forward is on United's wishlist for the summer transfer window, with Kane - now England and Tottenham's all-time leading scorer - a target. READ NEXT manual In his column for The Times, D.C. United manager Rooney praised Rashford's resilience and played up similarities to Kane. ""If you think back to only a year ago, Marcus was in and out of the starting XI, hardly scoring, playing in different positions and the smile I remembered from that lovely kid who came through the ranks and broke into our team when I was captain was gone,"" Rooney wrote. ""Now, he looks a totally different player and to be in a great place off the pitch as well. You can see he is enjoying his football and is more positive in his running. He penetrates with his runs off the ball and commits defenders when heâs on the ball - doing everything I wrote about wanting to see from him. ""He has always been a good finisher but, in front of goal, you can see the improvement that comes from confidence. He is taking his chances now without a secondâs thought whereas before he was overthinking and taking that extra second, then not being as decisive with his finish as he should be. ""He reminds me of Harry Kane in how he puts the ball in the net. You almost never see Harry score a goal where he caresses it into the corner - every finish is hit hard and goes in with pace. Marcus is quite similar. When he gets in front of goal he puts his foot through it. ""What he and Harry do is actually a much harder skill than, say, stroking it home like Thierry Henry used to do. Itâs harder because just like when you hit a golf shot and the harder you swing the less accurate you tend to be, you risk things going wrong. However when you develop the ability to get those finishes on target repeatedly, you become very hard to stop - like Harry throughout his career and Marcus recently."" LISTEN NOW"
How much Premier League clubs paid to agents,"Apr 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/how-much-premier-league-clubs-paid-to-agents,"Football agents, the mysterious figures skulking around the back of executive boxes with a phone sewn onto their ear, have never had it so good. The gargantuan fees paid by Premier League clubs to agents and intermediaries has increased in each of the last seven years. However, the unrelenting uptick may have reached its apex after FIFA announced in January that the commissions agents receive for player transfer fees would be capped going forward. However, those restrictions - which the world's most prominent representatives are unsurprisingly contesting - were not drafted early enough to prevent England's top-flight clubs from coughing up more than Â£300m combined on agents' fees (almost double the figure from 2016, Â£174m). Here's the breakdown of how much each Premier League team had to fork out across the summer and winter windows of the 2022/23 season. Club (Â£) Net total paid to Agents/Intermediaries Man City 51,563,571 Chelsea 43,160,072 Liverpool 33,691,782 Man Utd 24,726,374 Arsenal 16,749,072 Tottenham 16,137,103 Aston Villa 15,623,203 Leeds 15,310,814 Everton 13,542,845 West Ham 12,030,438 Newcastle 10,784,029 Leicester 10,282,967 Crystal Palace 9,796,296 Fulham 8,758,854 Brighton 8,583,317 Southampton 6,319,675 Wolves 6,186,765 Brentford 5,560,192 Bournemouth 5,058,871 Nottingham Forest 4,353,186 Data from the English Football Association Manchester City top the chart with more than Â£51m going to various intermediaries this season. The reigning Premier League champions spent less on transfers than Wolverhampton Wanderers but the acquisition of Erling Haaland - for a paltry sum of Â£51.2m to Borussia Dortmund - came under the conditions of a hefty bonus for the striker's representatives, with Rafaela Pimenta reportedly earning Â£34m from the deal.  Roughly speaking, for every Â£2.50 City spent on player fees this season, they have paid agents Â£1.00 - the highest ratio in the Premier League. Chelsea have spent around 2.5 times more on transfer fees in this time period than any other club, yet the new hierarchy in west London has managed to limit the figures for agents to Â£43m. Manchester United, the only team other than Chelsea to exceed Â£200m in this season's summer and winter windows, have spent almost half as much as the Blues on agents (Â£24m). Liverpool have only signed five senior players this season yet rank third for fees paid to agents among England's top flight. The sizeable sums which were required to lure Darwin Nunez (Â£64m) and Cody Gakpo (Â£40m) to Anfield likely account for much of this expenditure. Arsenal and Tottenham, the rest of the so-called 'Big Six', round out the leading half-dozen agent feeders with Aston Villa next on the list. The Villans were keen to strengthen the squad for Steven Gerrard in the summer and brought in Jhon Duran along with Alex Moreno after Unai Emery replaced the former Liverpool midfielder. At the other end of the spectrum, Nottingham Forest broke records by acquiring as many as 30 players. The promoted outfit sacked two senior members of the recruitment team that oversaw such an overhaul in October but the individual that negotiated the finances of each deal warrants plenty of praise; despite their free-wheeling approach, Forest paid agents less than any other Premier League team. Fellow promoted side Bournemouth limited their outlay on representatives to a little over Â£5m while infamously canny operators Brentford round out the thriftiest three teams in the Premier League with just Â£5.5m to the world's agents."
