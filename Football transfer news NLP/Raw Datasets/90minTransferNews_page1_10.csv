Chelsea agree Romeo Lavia fee with Southampton,"Aug 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-agree-romeo-lavia-fee-southampton,"Chelsea have finalised an agreement with Southampton to sign midfielder Romeo Lavia, 90min understands. After striking a deal over a fee with the Saints, Chelsea set about finalising the terms of a move which sources have confirmed is worth around Â£58m including add-ons. Southampton director Jason Wilcox confirmed earlier on Tuesday that the two clubs were still in negotiations at that point, but just a few hours later, the Saints have shook hands with Chelsea and are bidding farewell to Lavia. Lavia is due to undergo a medical with Chelsea in the coming days ahead of putting pen to paper on another long-term contract at Stamford Bridge. The Belgian had the opportunity to join Liverpool this summer but, like Moises Caicedo, has opted to join Chelsea instead. feed Should all go to plan with his medical, Lavia will become the latest in a long list of new signings at Chelsea. Alongside Caicedo, the Blues have already recruited Axel Disasi, Christopher Nkunku, Nicolas Jackson, Lesley Ugochukwu, Angelo Gabriel, Robert Sanchez and Diego Moreira this summer, and they are not expected to finish there. Indeed, 90min understands Chelsea have agreed a deal to sign Crystal Palace midfielder Michael Olise, who has a Â£35m release clause in his contract with the Eagles. The Blues are then expected to turn their attention to a new goalkeeper to replace Kepa Arrizabalaga, who has joined Real Madrid on loan, while club officials have not yet ruled out pursuing another striker as well."
Harry Maguire's proposed West Ham transfer collapses,"Aug 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/harry-maguire-proposed-west-ham-transfer-collapses,"Harry Maguire's proposed transfer to West Ham United has collapsed, 90min understands. After telling Maguire he is free to leave Old Trafford this summer, Manchester United initially rejected a Â£30m bid from West Ham amid concerns over their ability to satisfy the centre-back's wage demands, only to eventually agree to the offer on the table. West Ham have since completed the signings of Edson Alvarez and James Ward-Prowse but talks over Maguire continued to drag on as they sought to thrash out a wage agreement with both the defender and United. 90min understands that Maguire had agreed the terms of a reduced contract with West Ham but sought a pay-off from United to compensate him for the loss in salary over the remaining two years of his deal at Old Trafford. Sources have now confirmed that no agreement was reached between Maguire and United, forcing West Ham to accept defeat in their pursuit of the centre-back. feed United had been preparing for Maguire's exit by speaking with Bayern Munich over French defender Benjamin Pavard but, as 90min revealed earlier this summer, the Red Devils fear they do not have the financial room to sign another defender with Maguire's high wages still on the books. There has been tentative interest in Maguire from elsewhere but United are not expecting more bids for the 30-year-old, who appears set to remain at Old Trafford beyond this summer. Manager Erik ten Hag is known to be happy to continue working with Maguire as a backup to Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez, but he recently warned the England international that he is in for a fight for minutes if he chooses to stay. Maguire remains under contract at United until 2025, with the club holding the option to extend his deal by a further 12 months."
Southampton director breaks down Chelsea & Liverpool's battle for Romeo Lavia,"Aug 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/southampton-director-breaks-down-chelsea-liverpool-battle-romeo-lavia,"Southampton director Jason Wilcox has revealed he expects to see Romeo Lavia's move away from the club finalised in the coming days. Despite significant interest from Liverpool, Lavia is understood to have opted to join Chelsea this summer, following Ecuador midfielder Moises Caicedo in choosing Stamford Bridge over Anfield. Wilcox, who expects to see Lavia's move sealed this week, offered fans at the BBC Solent Fansâ Forum an insight into the complicated negotiations with both Liverpool and Chelsea. ""I think you know, it's well known that we've had some significant interest in Romeo, we've had an offer which we accepted from Liverpool,"" Wilcox began. ""Then Chelsea came to the table. So we're currently in negotiation with Chelsea now so it's a real tricky period for Romeo. But I'm confident that something will get done in the next week or so or in the next few days. ""And I think, you know, when we look at what Romeo's achieved here, I think every one of us here wouldn't want to lose him but the reality is, we're in the Championship and we need to reinvest and by buying Shea Charles, we've got another one who hopefully we can do the same with. ""So good luck to Romeo. Let's say it's not done yet. But we envisage in the next few days it will be completed."" feed With a move for Lavia almost wrapped up, 90min understands that Chelsea have now turned their attention to concluding a deal for Crystal Palace's Michael Olise. As for Liverpool, the search for midfield reinforcements continues. Jurgen Klopp has already signed Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai but the surprise departures of Jordan Henderson and Fabinho have left the Reds short. Leeds United's Tyler Adams is understood to be on Liverpool's radar. Chelsea had been in talks with the United States international but the Blues opted to focus on Caicedo and Lavia instead."
Neymar completes move from PSG to Al Hilal,"Aug 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/neymar-completes-move-psg-hilal,"Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal have confirmed the signing of superstar forward Neymar from Paris Saint-Germain.  90min understands that the Saudi Arabian club have paid â¬90m (Â£77.6m) for the 31-year-old's services, brining an end to his six-year stay at PSG. The Ligue 1 club made Neymar the most expensive footballer in history back in 2017, signing the player for Â£190m.  While the Brazilian won five Ligue 1 titles in Paris, he struggled with a number of muscle injuries throughout his time at the club, failing to make more than 22 league appearances in any of his six campaigns with the club.  Speaking to PSG's official website, club chairman and CEO Nasser Al-Khelaifi said: ""It is inevitably difficult to say goodbye to a legend of the Club, which Neymar will be forever. I will never forget the day he arrived at Paris Saint-Germain, nor what he brought to our club and our project over the past six years. ""We have lived extraordinary moments and Neymar will always be part of our history. I would like to thank him and his family. We wish Neymar the best for the future and his next adventure.""  manual Neymar has put pen to paper on a two-year deal in Saudi Arabia, and has picked the number 10 jersey to wear at Al Hilal.

Al Hilal have been incredibly active in the transfer market so far this summer, bringing in Kalidou Koulibaly, Ruben Neves, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Malcom already."
How Moises Caicedo fee compares to most expensive signings in football history,"Aug 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/how-moises-caicedo-fee-compares-most-expensive-signings-football-history,"Moises Caicedo is no stranger to a drawn-out transfer saga. Years before Chelsea began peppering Brighton with dizzying offers only to be outbid by Liverpool, before the Blues bid Â£115m to secure his services this week, Caicedo was the subject of a multi-club tussle while he was still in Ecuador with Independiente del Valle. Manchester United, AC Milan, Brighton, Chelsea and Belgian side Club Brugge were all interested in the midfielder after a rapid ascension in senior South American football. Three separate agencies also tried to represent Caicedo and get a slice of any potentially lucrative deal. Ultimately, Brighton cut through the chaos to snag Caicedo for just Â£4.5m in 2021. After less than 50 starts for the Seagulls, the 21-year-old has now become one of the most expensive players in the history of the sport. Here's how Caicedo's Â£115m move to Chelsea compares to the game's other costly sagas. Chelsea confirmed the signing of Caicedo after one of the most dramatic transfer sagas of recent times. The Blues had been pursuing the midfielder for the majority of the summer, however had been unwilling to make a bid over Â£80m until Liverpool agreed to fork out Â£111m for his services.  Despite an agreement between Liverpool and Brighton being struck, Caicedo was unwilling to agree to a move to Anfield, opening the door for Chelsea to swoop in and have a Â£115m bid accepted for his services.  The midfielder has now put pen to paper on an eight-year deal at Stamford Bridge.  Caicedo has become the most expensive signing for Chelsea and any other British club. But where does he rank on a global scale? Ranking Player Signed Joined Fee 1 Neymar 2017 PSG Â£198m 2 Kylian Mbappe 2018 PSG Â£163m 3 Philippe Coutinho 2018 Barcelona Â£142m 4 Ousmane Dembele 2017 Barcelona Â£135m 5 Moises Caicedo 2023 Chelsea Â£115m 6 Joao Felix 2019 Atletico Madrid Â£113m 7 Enzo Fernandez 2023 Chelsea Â£107m 8 Antoine Griezmann 2019 Barcelona Â£107m 9 Declan Rice 2023 Arsenal Â£105m 10 Jack Grealish 2021 Manchester City Â£100m Less than four years after making his senior debut as a 17-year-old in the Ecuadorian top flight, Caicedo has become the fifth most expensive footballer of all time.  Even though Caicedo's fee has scratched nine digits, Neymar's move to PSG comfortably remains the most expensive in history, with the Ligue 1 giants paying Â£198m for the forward's services.  Neymar's PSG teammate Kylian Mbappe is second on the list but could have moved into top spot after Al Hilal's Â£259m offer was accepted by the French champions. Mbappe ultimately refused to even meet with representatives of the Saudi giants."
Chelsea closing in on Michael Olise signing,"Aug 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-closing-in-on-michael-olise-signing,"Chelsea are moving closer to a deal to sign Crystal Palace midfielder Michael Olise, 90min understands. Arsenal and Manchester City were both intrigued by news of a Â£35m release clause in Olise's contract but, as 90min reported last month, Chelsea have long been confident they would win the race for his signature. Talks over personal terms have been ongoing for weeks and now sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea have taken a step forward in their negotiations with Palace as they seek to get an agreement over the line. Olise, who can play both in midfield and out on the wing, spent several years in the Chelsea academy before leaving aged 14, while his brother Richard, 18, is part of the Blues' Under-21 setup currently. feed Chelsea hope to finalise Olise's signing soon but are in no rush to do so as the 21-year-old is currently sidelined with a hamstring injury he picked up at this summer's Under-21 European Championships. Olise is not expected to return to the pitch until the end of September at the earliest so there is no imminent deadline to get the Frenchman registered for any upcoming fixtures, unlike midfielder Romeo Lavia, whose transfer from Southampton could be completed in time for the Belgian to face West Ham United on Sunday alongside fellow new arrival Moises Caicedo. 90min understands that Chelsea are expected to end their midfield rebuild once the moves for Lavia and Olise are finalised, with the Blues set to switch their attention to finding a goalkeeper to replace Kepa Arrizabalaga, who joined Real Madrid on loan and admitted during his presentation that he wants to stay in Spain beyond this season. A new striker is also a possibility for Chelsea, who lost Christopher Nkunku to a knee injury for the next four months.  Nicolas Jackson has impressed up top for Mauricio Pochettino's side, but Chelsea are otherwise short in attack as 21-year-old Armando Broja is still pushing to return from an ACL injury. Academy striker Mason Burstow was on the bench for the season-opener against Liverpool."
Chelsea midfielder seals loan exit,"Aug 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-midfielder-seals-loan-exit,"Talented Chelsea youngster Cesare Casadei has joined Championship side Leicester City on a season-long loan.  Casadei spent the 2022/23 campaign on loan in the same division with Reading, making 15 appearances and scoring one goal.  The midfielder has recently caught the eye much more at Under-20 level for Italy, winning the Golden Ball and Golden Boot awards for his stunning performances in the FIFA Under-20 World Cup. In Italy's run to the final - a final they'd lose to Uruguay 1-0 - Casadei managed a thoroughly impressive seven goals in seven games.  With Chelsea confirming the British record signing of Moises Caicedo this week and also closing in on Romeo Lavia from Southampton, the Italian midfielder has now secured a loan to Leicester in order to get some game time under his belt.  feed Speaking to the Foxes' official website after making the move, Casadei said: ""I feel really good. Iâm really happy to be here, Iâm excited and I canât wait to get started. Obviously, Leicester is a big team so Iâm here to win and to do as well as possible to fight and to work hard for this team."" In a statement released by Chelsea, the club's co-sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley added: ""This loan move is the perfect opportunity for Cesare to continue his progression as an exciting, young footballer. ""Weâre excited to see how he performs under Enzo Maresca at Leicester and look forward to watching him continue on this journey."""
Moises Caicedo: Brighton CEO admits surprise at Liverpool snub,"Aug 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/moises-caicedo-brighton-ceo-surprise-liverpool-snub,"Brighton and Hove Albion CEO Paul Barber has confessed Moises Caicedo's decision to reject a transfer to Liverpool in favour of joining Chelsea came as a surprise. Chelsea confirmed the Â£115m signing of Caicedo on Monday after a tense weekend which began with Liverpool coming out of nowhere to agree a fee of Â£111m to sign the Ecuador international. However, Caicedo soon made it clear that he would prefer a move to Stamford Bridge, urging Brighton to reopen negotiations with Chelsea and ultimately sealing the move he was looking for. Barber admitted to talkSPORT that Caicedo's stance left Brighton in an unexpected and ""difficult"" situation as they tried to find an outcome which satisfied everyone. feed ""Liverpool are a fantastic club, youâd imagine anyone would be running up the M6 for the chance to play at Anfield, but for whatever reason, Moises and his advisors decided London was their preferred destination,"" he said. ""In that situation weâre in a difficult position; weâve negotiated a British record deal deal and spent several days working with Liverpool, who were were professional throughout. ""At that point [when Caicedo rejected the move], weâre out of the loop, it is all between the player and Liverpool. When it became clear he isnât going to be joining Liverpool, we have to go into a different mode, we then have to do it all again, which we did. ""We started working with Chelsea, and we had to protect our own interests which is the player. We did that and now Moises goes on to the next step in his career."" Liverpool and Chelsea have also butted heads over Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia who, like Caicedo, has opted to move to Stamford Bridge this summer."
Kepa Arrizabalaga reveals desire to seal permanent Real Madrid transfer,"Aug 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/kepa-arrizabalaga-desire-seal-permanent-real-madrid-transfer,"Kepa Arrizabalaga has confirmed he hopes to seal a permanent move to Real Madrid after joining the Spanish side on an initial loan from Chelsea. After Thibaut Courtois went down with a serious knee injury, Madrid began searching for a new goalkeeper and eventually settled on Kepa, who joined on Monday in a loan deal which does not include the option for Madrid to make the move permanent. Even though there is no purchase clause in Kepa's loan contract, the 28-year-old made it clear he is looking to stay in Madrid for the foreseeable future. ""I really hope Real Madrid will keep me at the end of the season,"" he told a press conference when asked if he wants to stay at Madrid. ""Today is the first day of my assignment. We have time, we'll see.

Arsenal confirm signing of David Raya on loan from Brentford,"Aug 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-confirm-signing-david-raya-loan-brentford,"Arsenal have completed the signing of goalkeeper David Raya on a season-long loan from Brentford. The Gunners allowed previous deputy Matt Turner to join Nottingham Forest earlier this month and have now replaced him with the in-demand Raya. A small loan fee has been paid and 90min understands Arsenal also have the option to buy Raya permanently for a total package of Â£30m. Sporting director Edu told the club's official website: ""We welcome David to us on a season-long loan from Brentford.  ""David is a top-quality goalkeeper, who has consistently performed to a high level with Brentford in the Premier League. With David joining us we are adding quality and depth to our squad so we can perform at the highest possible level in all competitions."" Raya, who has been handed the number 22 shirt last worn by Pablo Mari during the 2021/22 campaign, signed a new two-year contract with Brentford before making the move, with the Bees also holding the option to extend that by a further 12 months. feed Raya, who was also wanted by Bayern Munich and had interest from a number of other top Premier League sides, will now compete with current number one Aaron Ramsdale for a spot in Mikel Arteta's lineup. ""Bring it on,"" Ramsdale told ITV of the competition before Raya's move was finalised. ""Nothing comes easy in football.  ""But also at the same time you need to move along and adapt as well. I've done it to other people when I've moved to clubs. I'm not going to be thinking that it's never going to happen to me. So, yeah, I think if it happens, it happens and then we'll fight and we'll make each other the best version of ourselves because that's what the manager is telling us as well. ""I'm sure whoever plays, me, Matt, whoever comes in, the goalkeeping union, people will laugh at but it's a real thing, and your individual disappointment will go away and you'll put the team first and you'll put that goalkeeper first as well."""
Every time British transfer record broken in Premier League era,"Aug 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/every-time-british-transfer-record-broken-premier-league-era,"As the years go by, more and more money is being spent by clubs in the transfer market. Lucrative broadcasting rights, commercial deals and other premium sponsorship means clubs are richer than ever, particularly if they have happen to being playing in the Premier League. The biggest transfers seen in world football may have happened around continental Europe, sure, but the level of spending in England, and regularity of it, is at an all-time high. And with Moises Caicedo's Â£115m move from Brighton to Chelsea now complete, the British transfer record has been smashed a whopping 19 times since the Premier League's inception in 1992. Here's every player and move to hold that accolade... Alan Shearer had only scored 23 goals in 118 appearances for Southampton by the time he left for Blackburn Rovers in 1992 - an average a goal just over every five games. But the soon-to-be Premier League winners, who had earned their place in the top flight via the second tier play-offs, knew exactly what they were getting with Shearer. A player who finish with both feet, bury headers for fun, and smash them in from close range and from long distance. Not even Blackburn could have imagined Shearer's time at Ewood Park to go as well as it did, mind you. He scored 112 goals for the club four seasons - one of those was severely disrupted by injury - and scored over 30 in each of his final three, including lifting the title in 1995. One of Sir Alex Ferguson's greatest pieces of work was nipping in ahead of Blackburn, who were being bankrolled by multi-millionaire Jack Walker, to sign Roy Keane for Manchester United. It was a genuine move from Ferguson as Keane spearheaded United's domination of the Premier League for the next decade -  the Irishman establishing himself at the very top of the game in terms of performance level and leadership qualities. Seven Premier League crowns and five appearances in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year tells you all you need to know. Fresh from scoring 25 goals for Norwich City in the 1993/94 Premier League season, Chris Sutton was picked up by Blackburn for Â£4m to partner Shearer up front. The transfer was an immediate success as the dynamic duo, flanked by Stuart Ripley and Jason Wilcox on the wings, scored goals for fun to steer Rovers to the title on the final day of the season. Sutton stayed at the club for further four years, bagging a career-best 18 league goals in Blackburn colours during the 1997/98 season. If you're of a certain age, you'll know the saying 'Cole score goals'. Sir Alex Ferguson and Manchester United certainly knew it, which is why they decided to fork out Â£7m to sign Cole from Newcastle United in January 1995, including send Keith Gillespie the other way. He scored 12 in 18 during his first half season in red and another 81 across the next six years. Multiple Premier League titles followed as a result, with Cole's superb lob over Ian Walker to secure the 1998/99 crown one of his finer moments. Dennis Bergkamp arrived at Arsenal to huge fanfare in 1995 and it didn't take the Dutchman long to drag the club out of the mid-table doldrums. Under the management of Arsene Wenger, Bergkamp helped transform the Gunners into genuine title contenders, forming a deadly partnership up front with Ian Wright while linking up with the brilliant Marc Overmars on the wing. Arsenal won the Premier League title in 1997/98, 2001/02 and 2003/04, with Bergkamp's contributions earning him a statue outside the Emirates Stadium. ""Collymore closing in!"" is among the most iconic lines of commentary in Premier League history. It was uttered by Martin Tyler, former voice of Sky Sports, in the final moments of the iconic 4-3 thriller between Liverpool and Newcastle in April 1996. It also had a defining impact on that season's title race, costing Newcastle in their fierce battle with Manchester United. Collymore's rise had been rapid to the say the least. He had struggled to make an impact in the top flight as a teenager with Crystal Palace, before joining Nottingham Forest in the second tier afetr a spell at Southend. He then took his prolific lower league form into the Premier League and was poached by Liverpool for a British record fee after just one season (and 22 goals). Alan Shearer's move to boyhood club Newcastle in 1996 wasn't just a British record transfer, it was a world record too - the Â£15m deal surpassed the Â£13.2m that Barcelona paid to PSV Eindhoven for Brazilian prodigy Ronaldo only weeks earlier that same summer. Manchester United were also very keen on Shearer too, but were famously to the deal. Most thought it was Shearer's desire to join his home town team, who had narrowly missed out on the 1995/96 Premier League title and played some of the best football in the country under Kevin Keegan. But then Manchester United chairman has claimed in more recent years there was more to it. ""Shearer had been to Alex Ferguson's house, spoke to him and assured him he wanted to come [to Manchester],"" Edwards said on a podcast while promoting a book in 2019. ""The problem, I think, was with the chairman of Blackburn, Jack Walker, who was not a great fan of Manchester United...local rivals, both Lancashire clubs. He did not want Alan Shearer to come to Manchester United. Shearer was quite close to Walker, who was like a father figure to him, and I don't think Alan wanted to upset him by coming to United. And I'm not sure Jack would have let him come anyway, whereas he was happy for Alan to go to Newcastle, I don't think that was a threat to him."" Shearer went on to score 206 goals in 10 years at Newcastle, breaking the club's all-time record previously held for decades by Jackie Milburn. Leeds made Rio Ferdinand the world's most expensive defender when they paid Â£18m to West Ham in the final weeks of 2000. The club's overspending would later lead to their financial demise, but the good times briefly rolled with Ferdinand dressed in all-white at the back. A few months after his arrival in west Yorkshire, the centre-back scored a famous goal in a Champions League quarter-final demolition of Deportivo La Coruna. His presence also coincided with a massive upturn in their domestic form, losing just two Premier League games in the second half of 2000/01 after a poor start to the campain. Manchester United had initially agreed to sign Ruud van Nistelrooy in 2000, only for the transfer to fall through over concerns about fitness. The Dutch stiker then suffered a dreaded ACL injury during a PSV Eindhoven training session, but United were still prepared to shell out a record fee in 2001. His goalscoring was immediate, netting twice on his Premier League debut and scoring 36 in all competitions on his first season, upping that number to 44 in his second. Van Nistelrooy finished his United career in 2006 with 150 goals in 219 games, an average of 30 per season, but is arguably an underrated part of the club's modern history because of what the likes of Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo went on to achieve in the years that immediately followed. ""I used to get excited when the club would sign a big player because thatâs the nature of the game. Veron came to the club, he was an excellent player, okay it didnât work out for him at United, but he was an excellent player,"" Roy Keane said in 2020, looking back on Juan Sebastian's two seasons at Manchester United. Veron signed for United having developed a lofty reputation thanks to his exploits in Serie A with Parma and Lazio. There was initial promise, that's for sure, and the Argentine particularly enjoyed the European nights, but struggled to cope with the physical demands of an entire Premier League season without a fixed role in the team. Injuries compromised his second season at Old Trafford after a promising start to the campaign, and United opted to cut their losses and sell to Chelsea in 2003. Undeterred by Veron's struggles, United broke the British record again the following summer, although Ferdinand's familiarity with the English game perhaps rendered his Â£29.3m arrival from Leeds substantially less of a risk.  Sir Alex Ferguson never doubted Rio's capacity to become one of the world's best in his position - his displays for England at the 2022 World Cup did that opinion no harm - and he rapidly developed into a stalwart of United's defence. Frighteningly quick and unerringly cool in possession, Ferdinand was the ultimate modern-day centre-back. He enjoyed a stellar 12-year career at Old Trafford, lifting six Premier League trophies and the Champions League in 2008. He's recognised as one of England's greatest defenders and a modern Manchester United legend.  It took a little while for Ferdinand's record to go, but smashed it was in the summer of 2006 as Chelsea prised former Ballon d'Or winner Andriy Shevchenko away from AC Milan.  The former Dynamo Kyiv hotshot emerged as one of the world's most potent forwards during his time in Lombardy. Shevchenko departed Milan as their second leading scorer of all-time and with a Champions League medal in his back pocket, and the Ballon d'Or on his mantelpiece. However, the Ukrainian striker struggled to adjust to life in west London. His two years at Chelsea were rather forgettable. He scored here and there, and only rarely did he put together a sustained run of form. The striker's apex was in the rearview mirror, that's for sure, and he returned to Milan on loan for the 2008/09 season before eventually settling back in Kyiv. This signing ignited the revolution that culminated in Manchester City blossoming into the Premier League's supreme force. On the same day City were bought out by the Abu Dhabi United Group, they quickly went to work and signed Brazilian star Robinho from Real Madrid for a British record Â£32.5m. City had been haggling Reggina and Portsmouth for the additions of Rolando Bianchi and Benjani respectively in the preceding months, now they were negotiating with Europe's elite. Money talks. Supposedly persuaded by City's Brazilian contingent that included former Santos teammate Elano, Robinho signed up for the project in Manchester and made an immediate difference. His first season at the club was superb as he ended the 2008/09 as the Premier League's fourth-highest goalscorer with 14. However, things quickly turned sour for the maverick attacker as injuries reduced his significance dramatically in year two. Discontent and perhaps fed up of listening to Mark Hughes, Robinho returned to Santos on loan in January 2010 and was never seen again in Manchester. Panic or sheer recruiting incompetence? Either way, Torres was never going to live up to his Â£50m price tag at Stamford Bridge.  The Spaniard was no longer the phenom that took the Premier League by storm at Liverpool, with injuries reducing his explosiveness and rendering him a nondescript threat. Torres was forced to evolve and while the striker that rocked up at Chelsea was a shell of his peak-self, he remained somewhat useful. He was never prolific for the Blues during his three-and-a-half years at the club, but he did score one of the most memorable goals in Chelsea's history away at Barcelona in the 2011/12 Champions League semi-finals. For that, many supporters overlooked his mammoth price tag. The ultimate maverick. A youthful but ambitious Pogba departed Manchester United for greater first-team opportunities overseas in 2012 and ended up at Juventus.  The Frenchman dazzled during his four years in Turin, swiftly evolving into the personification of a highlight reel and a bona fide superstar. Given his prestige, it was going to cost an arm and a leg for United to bring the midfielder 'home'. But they did exactly that in 2016, handing Juve Â£89m for his services. Now, summarising Pogba's second stint at United is rather tricky. While the conclusion was somewhat sombre, the Frenchman did enjoy some scintillating runs of form at Old Trafford. However, it's fair to say he couldn't quite justify United's massive outlay to bring him back, especially given that he eventually left for nothing (again) when he re-signed for Juve in 2022. Considering their riches, it's pretty remarkable that City only appear on this list twice. Nevertheless, they made Grealish the first-ever Englishman to garner a Â£100m fee in 2021.  The marvellous Brummie playmaker had put Aston Villa on his back during the 2019/20 season to keep the Villans in the Premier League, and a move away became increasingly inevitable after a fine 2020/21 campaign. City bit the bullet and acquired Grealish for a record fee after triggering his release clause, but it took the wide man a little while to find his feet at the Etihad. Adjusting to Pep Guardiola's demands is never easy, and Grealish struggled to flourish in his debut season. But he excelled in year two and played an underrated role in City's historic treble triumph. Overpriced, they said. Haha.  Convinced by his talent after an excellent 2022 World Cup with winners Argentina, Chelsea made a big splash in the January transfer window and signed Fernandez for a whopping Â£106.8m. Despite his stellar form in Qatar during the winter, eyebrows were ubiquitously raised given the midfielder's relative inexperience of European football.  He'd arrived at Benfica just six months prior.  Nevertheless, Fernandez stuck out for all the right reasons during his first few months in west London. He tried his utmost to ensure Chelsea looked competent, but not even he could salvage the Blues.  A controller, playmaker and potentially a final third producer all wrapped into one elegant midfield operator, Fernandez is set to take the Premier League by storm under Mauricio Pochettino at Stamford Bridge. Finding a suitable midfield partner for Fernandez was one of Chelsea's key objectives in the 2023 summer transfer window, and they finally got their man.  Sure, it might've taken yet another British record fee to acquire their desired midfield target, but Moises Caicedo's potential alongside Fernandez renders the outlay somewhat measured given the tandem's projected dynamic."
Aston Villa close to finalising Nicolo Zaniolo deal,"Aug 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/aston-villa-close-finalising-nicolo-zaniolo-deal,"Aston Villa are close to finalising a deal with Galatasaray for Italy international Nicolo Zaniolo, sources have confirmed to 90min.

Zaniolo helped Gala to their first Turkish Super Lig title in four years by scoring five goals in ten league games, but now he is set to leave the club just six months after arriving.

Man Utd learn new Bayern Munich asking price for Benjamin Pavard,"Aug 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-new-bayern-munich-asking-price-benjamin-pavard,"Bayern Munich have told Manchester United that they want a fee of â¬40m (Â£34.5m) plus add-ons for Benjamin Pavard, 90min understands. The 27-year-old is keen to leave the Allianz Arena this summer in search of a new challenge having lifted numerous trophies since arriving in Bavaria from Stuttgart in 2019. United, meanwhile, are keen to sign a new centre-back as they attempt to offload Harry Maguire to West Ham United in a Â£30m deal, with Pavard's name high up on an extensive list of potential transfer targets. 90min previously revealed that United had open talks with Bayern over a deal for Pavard, who can play at right-back and at centre-back, and were working towards a deal that valued the World Cup winner at â¬35m (Â£30m). But sources have confirmed to 90min that Bayern have communicated to United that they're looking for â¬40m plus add-ons for Pavard, much to the chagrin of the 13-time Premier League winners. Pavard is said to be unimpressed with Bayern's change in stance, with personal terms agreed in principle over a move to Old Trafford, with United also surprised by the moving of the goalposts. feed Talks are ongoing between the two parties, with United in particular keen to find a resolution, but Bayern's inability to land Kyle Walker from Manchester City means the Bundesliga giants could change their stance entirely on a potential sale. Jean-Clair Todibo, Perr Schuurs, Jarrad Branthwaite, Edmond Tapsoba and Benficaâs Antonio Silva are other options being considered by United, as they bid to strengthen the depth of Erik ten Hag's squad, though they don't offer the same positional versatility that Pavard does. To add fuel to the rumour fire, Pavard liked an Instagram post from United's official Instagram account that celebrated Raphael Varane's winner against Wolves on Monday night - though the two are international teammates and are known to be close friends. United have signed Andre Onana, Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund for significant transfer fees this summer, also adding Jonny Evans to their squad on a short-term deal. There have also been a number of outgoing this summer, with David de Gea and Freed the most high-profile exits to date. Maguire may follow, providing he gives an imminent answer to West Ham over a move to London Stadium, and there's continued speculation over the future of midfielder Scott McTominay."
Neymar picks Al Hilal shirt number ahead of transfer confirmation,"Aug 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/neymar-al-hilal-shirt-number-transfer-confirmation,"Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar will complete his transfer to Al Hilal this week and has already picked out his new shirt number, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Brazil superstar will bring to an end his six-year stay in the French capital after agreeing terms on a two-year contract with the Saudi Pro League side. During his time with PSG, he averaged just 19 Ligue 1 matches per season and was continually criticised for his injury record and lifestyle away from the pitch. Neymar will wrap up a move to Saudi Arabia this week with Al Hilal set to pay â¬90m (Â£77.6m) to PSG, and 90min understands the 31-year-old has been given the freedom to pick a new shirt number. Instead of taking on a new digit, Neymar will stick with his tried and tested number 10, which is currently free and will not need to be vacated. feed Neymar has worn the 10 shirt throughout his time at PSG and has played most of his games for Brazil with that number. He previously took the number 11 at Santos and Barcelona.  Sources have also told 90min that Al Hilal have not given up hope of signing Aleksandar Mitrovic. They reached an agreement with the Serbia international over personal terms earlier this summer, but despite indicating a willingness to pay â¬58m (Â£50m), Fulham were unwilling to sanction a sale. PSG, meanwhile, are continuing their squad clear-out with the departures of Leandro Paredes and Renato Sanches to Roma. Argentine World Cup winner Paredes is set to return to the Stadio Olimpico after a previous spell with the Giallorossi on a permanent two-year deal, while Sanches is joining on an initial loan with an obligatory purchase clause if he plays in more than 60% of their Serie A matches this season."
Eric Dier wanted by clubs across Europe & Saudi Arabia as Tottenham consider sale,"Aug 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/eric-dier-wanted-clubs-europe-saudi-arabia-tottenham-consider-sale,"Tottenham Hotspur defender Eric Dier could leave the club before the end of the summer transfer window with a number of teams considering a move for him, sources have confirmed to 90min. Dier has less than one year left to run on his Spurs contract but an agreement over an extension has not been reached and is not believed to be close. 90min were first to report back in June that Tottenham would be open to selling Dier as he was not in the immediate plans of new head coach Ange Postecoglou. The 29-year-old was left out of Spurs' matchday squad for their Premier League opening day draw at Brentford on Sunday, with Postecoglou revealing this was a tactical decision as Dier was fully fit. He was also omitted from the Greek-Australian's new-look leadership group despite playing a prevalent role under previous managers. With new vice-captain Cristian Romero, summer signing Micky van de Ven, Davinson Sanchez and Ben Davies all ahead of Dier in the pecking order, he could leave before the window closes, with Tottenham looking to trim their bloated squad ahead of the deadline on 1 September. Dier, who grew up in Portugal from the age of seven, admitted last year that he would like to play abroad again, and 90min understands he could get his wish. Former side Sporting CP would contemplate a reunion if they were to sell in-demand defender Goncalo Inacio in the next few weeks, while Lisbon rivals Benfica are also monitoring Dier in case their own highly-rated centre-back Antonio Silva leaves. However, it is likely that both clubs will keep hold of their homegrown stars for the time being. feed Ligue 1 side Monaco, who have been linked with Fulham defender and Tottenham target Tosin Adarabioyo, have asked Tottenham about the availability of Dier, as have a number of Bundesliga teams. Closer to home, London neighbours Crystal Palace and Scottish champions Celtic are believed to be admirers of Dier. There is also pressing interest in Dier from Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, who already have the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Sadio Mane on their books. Unlike Dier's other suitors, they would be able to pay Spurs a more generous transfer fee, with European clubs looking for a cut-price deal. Dier joined Tottenham from Sporting back in 2014 and was one of their first signings under Mauricio Pochettino. He spent much of his debut season playing at right-back or centre-back before being moved into midfield under the Argentine. Since Spurs hired Jose Mourinho in 2019, Dier has almost exclusively played in his preferred centre-back role. He's played 361 games in all competitions for the Lilywhites."

Jurgen Kloppâs side have signed both Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboslai to strengthen in midfield since the end of last season. But with Jordan Henderson, Fabinho, James Milner, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all leaving, getting additional bodies in has still been important.

Neymar agrees personal terms with Al Hilal,"Aug 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/neymar-agrees-personal-terms-al-hilal,"Neymar has agreed personal terms with Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal as he inches closer to a move away from Paris Saint-Germain, 90min understands. The Brazil international was offered the chance to move to the Middle East earlier this summer when Al Hilal made him their top alternative to PSG teammate Kylian Mbappe, but Neymar initially rejected the offer. However, sources have now confirmed to 90min that Neymar has given his approval to joining Al Hilal, who are back in pursuit of the Brazilian after their attemps to land Napoli striker Victor Osimhen fell flat, and has agreed the terms of an eye-watering contract worth around â¬220,000 (Â£189,000) per day. PSG, who have been looking for buyers for Neymar, have welcomed interest from the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) and are understood to have accepted a â¬90m (Â£77.6m) bid from Al Hilal to get the deal done. All parties are now finalising a move which is expected to be formally completed in the coming days. feed Saudi sources have laughed off suggestions Neymar could be loaned out after joining Al Hilal amid rumours of potential interest from Barcelona. Neymar's expected departure is the latest event in a tumultuous summer for PSG, who also remain in talks with Al Hilal over the potential sale of midfielder Marco Verratti. Lionel Messi left on a free transfer to join Inter Miami and it appeared as though he would be followed out the door by Kylian Mbappe who, after confirming he did not plan to trigger the extension in his contract, was frozen out of the first team. After being omitted from Luis Enrique's first matchday squad, however, Mbappe was welcomed back into the squad and the 24-year-old is in line to make his first appearance of the season against Toulouse on Saturday."
West Ham confirm signing and squad number of James Ward-Prowse,"Aug 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-confirm-signing-squad-number-james-ward-prowse,"West Ham United have completed the signing of Southampton captain James Ward-Prowse for an undisclosed fee. The 28-year-old has inked a four-year contract at London Stadium to end an association with Southampton that dates all the way back to 2003, joining David Moyes' side after the latter's relegation to the Championship. ""Iâm buzzing to be here at West Ham United. Itâs great to be here and Iâm looking forward to getting going,""Â Ward-Prowse told the club's official website. ""From the outside looking in, this is a Club that has been on the rise for a number of years now and coming off the success in the UEFA Europa Conference League last year, you can feel there is real momentum around this Club. Itâs great to be a part of it and I canât wait to play my role in the games to come. ""When I think about my game, it is based on hard work, graft, and giving 100%. West Ham United has always been a Club that has epitomises that. You can feel that from the fans and you can see it in the players who are here and the lads that have come through the Academy too. ""I feel as though I will fit straight in and I can promise I will give my all for this football club in my time here."" feed Capped 11 times by England, Ward-Prowse made 410 appearances on the south coast in all competitions, scoring 55 goals while laying on the same amount for his teammates, with his leadership skills among the traits praised by Moyes. ""Iâm delighted to bring a player of Jamesâ quality and experience to West Ham United,""Â the Scot said of Ward-Prowse's arrival. âHe's performed to a very high level in the Premier League over the last decade, constantly producing good numbers season after season. ""His leadership qualities are obviously another huge plus for us â heâll be a big voice for us, someone who drives the team on from the middle of the pitch. Weâre excited to get him up and running, for what will be another busy season on both the domestic and European front."" Ward-Prowse will wear the number 7 shirt at West Ham, vacated by Gianluca Scamacca following his Â£26m move to Atalanta, and although the fee is undisclosed, 90min understands that around Â£30m has been parted with to facilitate the move."
Chelsea agree British record deal with Brighton for Moises Caicedo,"Aug 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-agree-british-record-deal-brighton-moises-caicedo,"Chelsea have agreed a British record deal of Â£115m with Brighton & Hove Albion to sign midfielder Moises Caicedo, sources have confirmed to 90min. Just hours after their Premier League opener with Liverpool at Stamford Bridge, which ended 1-1, Chelsea reached an agreement with Brighton over their top summer transfer target. Caicedo is now due for his medical in London after which point he will put pen to paper on an eight-year contract which will also have an option for another season. The news of the agreement brings to an a frantic few days which has seen Chelsea beat Premier League rivals Liverpool to Caicedo's signature. Chelsea had been pursuing Caicedo all summer but up until last week refused to make a bid of over Â£80m, with Brighton demanding at least Â£100m for the South American midfielder, until Liverpool suddenly made an offer on Thursday evening and agreed terms on a deal worth Â£111m. feed With Caicedo due for a medical on Merseyside on Friday, Liverpool looked to have beaten their top-flight rivals to his signature, but it then emerged that the 21-year-old had informed Brighton of his unwillingness to finalise a move to Anfield as he preferred to join Chelsea. Although Liverpool's offer remained on the table, Chelsea began talks and soon became confident of finally bringing Caicedo to Stamford Bridge. Now Chelsea have agreed a deal worth Â£115m which will see them break the British transfer record once again. The Blues paid Â£106m for Enzo Fernandez in January but are set to exceed that figure for Caicedo. Brighton will receive Â£100m in guaranteed money from Chelsea with a further Â£15m in add-ons, while the Seagulls will also retain a sell-on clause. Meanwhile, 90min understands that Chelsea believe they are well placed to finalise a deal to bring Southampton's Romeo Lavia to the club. Both Chelsea and again Liverpool have agreed fees with the Saints worth around Â£55m for the Belgian international midfielder."
Chelsea 1-1 Liverpool: So who needs Moises Caicedo more?,"Aug 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-1-1-liverpool-who-needs-moises-caicedo-more,"From Stamford Bridge - The stage was set perfectly. Chelsea and Liverpool had been going at it hammer and tongs in the transfer market in the week leading up to their Premier League fixture at Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon. Moises Caicedo was, and remains, the object of their desires. The Brighton midfielder will become the most expensive player in Premier League history when he does eventually transfer, at some point in the coming week, you'd expect, with Liverpool initially having an offer accepted of Â£111m for the Ecuadorian.  Caicedo has made his decision known that he'd prefer the move to west London, triggering public embarrassment for Liverpool - a club usually so efficient and proficient with their dealings to buy and sell first team players.  feed Having won the transfer pending an agreement with Brighton, which will be in the region of a quite ridiculous Â£115m, Chelsea had hoped to present the player to their home support with a deal completed in the days leading up to their 1-1 draw on Sunday. One for the social media channels to rack up the engagements on, y'know, but it wasn't to be. Caicedo wasn't there, but good grief did both teams want him to be, with the need for a dominating defensive midfielder desperately obvious for both throughout a frantic, chaotic 101 minutes of opening weekend action. But what did Sunday's game tell us about which team more desperately needs to break the British transfer record to sign a player with only 53 appearances in English football to his name? Liverpool might need a defensive midfielder, will try to confirm as and when pic.twitter.com/gg4CVUB0wd At least new Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino settled for pragmatism (in look and feel at least) as he attempted to cover the lack of defensive presence in midfield by naming a back three. Axel Disasi was named for a competitive debut alongside returning loanee Levi Colwill, with Thiago Silva relied upon in the middle. It suggested at least he was looking to stem the tide and not give too much away - though insisted post-match that his team played with four at the back. For Jurgen Klopp, it was back to gung-ho and heavy metal. You'd suppose you can't name a six in your team if you don't possess one, but Klopp went down the route of ""screw it"" with his team sheet, naming new signings Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister alongside Cody Gakpo in the most attacking of midfield units.  Mac Allister was tasked with being the deepest midfielder, operating with Trent Alexander-Arnold drifting in from the right full back slot. Who needs Moises Caicedo more? Liverpool, because I'm not changing my system Caicedo is largely praised for his ability to cover ground, shuttling across to cover spaces left behind his teammates with the licence to attack. Fair to say both teams could have really utilised him here - first half especially - and that whichever team gets him will have a gem for next decade in a dream scenario. The opening 45 was a story of Pure, Unadulterated Barclays: Chaos Edition, with both teams' defences breached. Liverpool fired a warning after 12 minutes when Mohamed Salah struck the bar, but hit the front before the 20th minute after some excellent work from the Egyptian. Chelsea left far too much space for Salah to take possession and far too much space behind their back line for Luis Diaz to tap in at the far post. Plenty at fault but good defensive midfielders stop breakaways at source. There'd have been little Caicedo could've done about the way Chelsea's equaliser came about - this was a story of space behind the back line and defenders switching off - but both teams had the ball in the net on a further occasion each only to see efforts ruled out for offside. In the second half, Conor Gallagher far better embraced the role he'd been given for the day as a midfield screen, while 90min POTM Enzo Fernandez grew in stature throughout with an imperious performance in possession. It meant the hosts shaded the second half, controlled the lions' share of possession and the chaos of the game had subsided...barring a frantic final few minutes. Who needs Moises Caicedo more?  Draw, because Conor Gallagher can't play like he did in the second half every week and Liverpool do not own a senior defensive midfielder WhoScored have Chelsea's pass completion at 88% compared to the visitors' 80%, but that could have something to do with Liverpool's direct style on the day and push to get the ball forward. There were spells throughout the first half and before Chelsea found their feet where Liverpool were cutting the hosts open with direct passes through the middle and through the channels, but over the course of the game Chelsea stomped it out. The Blues themselves found moments to penetrate with vertical passes through the middle and often threatened with charges up the pitch from players in possession - they could have won the match late on following a break in that manner. You'd have to chalk Chelsea's name on the board for better use of the ball today on the whole; namely because Enzo Fernandez is very good at football. But both teams have holes to fill. Who needs Moises Caicedo more? Liverpool, because they don't have a six and won't change their system During his time at Brighton, Caicedo was often seen covering in the absence of others at right back - and players nowadays - especially those who cost north of Â£100m - are hugely valued for versatility. Chelsea won't need that kind of cover given their options at right-sided centre back and with Malo Gusto joining the party over the summer and with Reece James named as club captain. Chelsea do need options and numbers in midfield but Caicedo's name is a dream scenario and the completion of a midfield unit. Liverpool, meanwhile, only have 18-year-old Stefan Bajcetic as a natural presence in defensive midfield - and nobody else following the sales of Fabinho and Jordan Henderson, while they rely on Ibrahima Konate to cover three or four positions when Alexander-Arnold steps into midfield and Liverpool don't have the ball. The Reds are in desperate need of a defensive presence in the centre and it would add levels to their game very quickly if they found the right fit. Who needs Moises Caicedo more? Liverpool Based on the evidence of today - from Jurgen Klopp's decision to play Alexis Mac Allister at six while he wore 10 on his back, from Mauricio Pochettino's decision to use a 3-5-2, from the second half performances of Conor Gallagher and Enzo Fernandez and from the apparent ease for opposing teams to progress through Liverpool's centre, you'd have to say it's Liverpool. Their bid has been accepted by Brighton but advances have been halted by the player, with Chelsea now primed to step in and complete the transfer in the week to come. They may even sign up Southampton's Romeo Lavia to really take the biscuit - though Klopp's team are to fight to the end on that one too with no decision from the player yet. If Chelsea do manage to secure their top target for the summer, they'll have a midfield unit of Caicedo and Enzo which will be the envy of the Premier League for seasons to come. It'll have cost in the region of Â£220m for the two, but if you're going for best in class, you've got to spend. Who needs Moises Caicedo more? Liverpool, but they're not getting him are they?"
Liverpool prepared to match Chelsea offer for Romeo Lavia,"Aug 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-prepared-to-match-chelsea-offer-romeo-lavia,"Liverpool are ready to match Chelseaâs offer for Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia, 90min understands, with the transfer battle between the Premier League giants continuing. The two clubs have already been at war over Brighton & Hove Albionâs Moises Caicedo in recent days. Chelsea have been pursuing the Ecuador international for months, but it was Liverpool who first agreed a deal with Brighton for a British record fee of Â£111m on Friday. Even then, it remained Caicedoâs preference to join Chelsea and the Blues, who had not previously offered more than Â£80m, refused to throw in the towel. As it stands, Chelsea are now confident of finalising an agreement with Brighton in excess of the Liverpool offer already accepted. But Caicedo wasnât the only player that Chelsea looked set to beat Jurgen Kloppâs team to. feed Liverpool, in need of midfielders after letting Jordan Henderson, Fabinho, Naby Keita, James Milner and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all leave this summer, had earlier seen three bids for Lavia rejected by Southampton â they had been holding out for Â£50m, with Liverpoolâs best offer totalling Â£45m. Suddenly, Chelsea came on the scene and submitted a Â£48m bid for Lavia before raising that offer to Â£55m - a fee which left the Blues confident of getting a deal done. 90min now understands that Liverpool are ready to make a fourth Lavia offer that matches Chelseaâs bid for the 19-year-old Belgian, who has played only 36 senior club games in his career. As far as Southampton are concerned, they are happy with the developments and keen to see how this bidding war between Chelsea and Liverpool plays out. Lavia, meanwhile, is yet to make known his preference one way or the other, having held positive talks with both clubs."
PSG confirm Kylian Mbappe's return to training after 'positive' talks over future,"Aug 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-confirm-kylian-mbappe-return-training-positive-talks-future,"Paris Saint-Germain have confirmed that Kylian Mbappe has been allowed to return to first-team training after ""constructive and positive discussions"" regarding his future.  90min reported earlier this week that Mbappe had reiterated his desire to stay at PSG beyond this summer despite not taking up his option to trigger a clause which would extend his current contract at the club until the summer of 2025. That decision not to trigger an extension had led to PSG shopping the superstar forward around this summer due to the fear of losing him as a free agent next summer. The Ligue 1 giants accepted a world record offerÂ of Â£257m (â¬300m) from Al Hilal last month, but despite proposing a gargantuan contract offer to Mbappe, the PIF-backed Saudi Pro League side wereÂ unable to persuade the France star to enter negotiations. On top of trying to sell Mbappe, PSG had also banished the player from first-team training and even refused to select him for their recent pre-season tour of Japan.  manual Now, however, the 2018 World Cup winner is back in the first-team squad and back in training with his teammates after what the club have described as positive talks regarding the player's future which took place on Saturday.  A club statement on the news reads: ""After very constructive and positive discussions between Paris Saint-Germain and Kylian Mbappe before the PSG - Lorient match, this Saturday 12th August, the player was reinstated in first-team training this morning.""  Mbappe was in the stands on Saturday for PSG's 0-0 draw with Lorient in their Ligue 1 season opener, sitting alongside new teammate Ousmane Dembele, whom the club officially confirmed the signing of on Saturday morning. The pair could feature together for the first time at club level next Saturday when Luis Enrique's team take on Toulouse."
Leeds issue Wilfried Gnonto statement as Everton change transfer target,"Aug 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/leeds-issue-wilfried-gnonto-statement-everton-change-transfer-target,"Leeds United have informed Wilfried Gnonto that he will not be sold, leading to his omission from the club's loss against Birmingham City on Saturday due to an internal disciplinary matter. The 19-year-old has been a subject of transfer interest this summer, with 90min revealing on Friday that Everton have had a bid rejected amid refusing to meet the Â£30m asking price set by Leeds. Juventus and Napoli had earlier been interested in taking Gnonto back to Italy. Leeds are determined to keep Gnonto him as they hope to make a swift return to the Premier League, communicating to both the player and his representatives that he will not be available for a transfer.  Manager Daniel Farke confirmed Gnonto's unavailability and ahead of the Birmingham fixture, the club chose to issue a formal statement on the matter. feed ""Earlier this week, Willy Gnonto and his representatives were informed by the club that he would not be sold this summer,"" it read. ""Following those conversations, Willy felt he was unable to play in Wednesday nightâs Carabao Cup tie with Shrewsbury Town. Despite training for the last two days, Willy has informed Daniel Farke that he still does not feel able to play this weekend and has not travelled to Birmingham for the game. This is now an internal disciplinary matter and the club will make no further comment, other than to reiterate that Willy Gnonto is not for sale."" With Leeds making clear their stance, 90min understands that Everton have switched targets, albeit not very far. Instead, the Toffees are now keen on Gnonto's teammate Jack Harrison. Talks regarding a potential loan move to Goodison Park are underway."
Fenerbahce announce signing of Fred from Man Utd,"Aug 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/fenerbahce-announce-signing-of-fred-from-man-utd,"Super Lig club Fenerbahce have officially confirmed the signing of midfielder Fred from Manchester United. The Brazil international completed his medical on Saturday in Istanbul after Fenerbahce agreed to pay Â£13m (â¬15m) inclusive of add-ons for his services. Fred had also garnered interest from Fulham and Saudi Pro League clubs during the summer transfer window, with the former being unwilling to meet Man Utd's asking price and the latter not appealing to player.  Fred has now put pen to paper on a four year, with an option for a fifth year, deal at the Ulker Stadium.  Speaking to the club's official website after making the move, Fred expressed his delight at signing for ""Turkey's biggest club"": ""I am very happy to come to Turkey's biggest club and a club with such a great history. I want to be a part of this history too. I hope everyone was happy too.  feed ""My first impressions are very good and positive. Everyone at the club made me feel very welcome. I was extra happy for that too. There are very important players in the history of Fenerbahce. As Brazilians, Alex de Souza and Roberto Carlos are some of these players.  I also want to win all the trophies and contribute to all successes. Of course, I want to make the fans happy. I first played on this field for the Brazilian national team nine years ago. Now I will play for Fenerbahce fans on this field here. I can not wait for this. "
Saudi Pro League determined to be a place for 'exceptional players only',"Aug 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/saudi-pro-league-determined-exceptional-players-only,"Saudi Pro League director of football Michael Emenalo claims the competition can position itself as one of the world's best within the next two years by targeting 'exceptional players only' The former technical director of Chelsea assumed his role in July and is continuing the Pro League's significant Â£400m investment initiative. This strategy has enticed players such as Karim Benzema, Jordan Henderson, Riyad Mahrez, and Roberto Firmino to join Saudi Arabian clubs this summer. So far, the majority of top stars heading to Saudi Arabia, including Benzema, N'Golo Kante and Cristiano Ronaldo, have been in the latter stages of their respective careers. At 26, Ruben Neves is one of the exceptions to the trend and arguably not in the same bracket of star anyway. Richard Masters, chief executive of the Premier League, recently shared that he isn't overly worried about Saudi Arabia's unrestricted spending. However, Emenalo cautioned that there are essentially no bounds to the country's willingness to invest in football players.  ""I would loveÂ to have Kylian Mbappe here. I would love to have Harry Kane here. The league would like all the top players,"" he said. Indeed, Mbappe has already been the subject of world record Â£259m bid from Al Hilal that was accepted by Paris Saint-Germain, although the plater himself wasn't interested in the move. manual ""In a couple of years, this will become a league for exceptional players only. It will become a league for those who are at the top of their game. We have the resources, and weâre going to use them,"" Emenalo said. ""I donât think it is going to take the same amount of time that it took the [English] Premier League to get there for us to establish ourselves."" Emenalo emphasised that the Saudi Pro League's aim is not to undermine the Premier League in a manner similar to LIV Golf and the PGA Tour and hopes that elite football's established order in Europe will eventually be less apprehensive and collaborate with them. âThe European leagues, especially the Premier League, are very strong, they have no reason to be scared,â he added. âI think thereâs panic in some areas, but this is from a misunderstanding of what we are trying to do. âI saw what [Jurgen] Klopp and what [Pep] Guardiola said [about the Pro League]. One is a coach I absolutely admire and the other is a good friend of mine in Pep. First, I hope they donât talk themselves out of a job [in Saudi Arabia] in the future. I understand their concerns. Our goal is to work together with all the leagues and be a brotherhood in the football industry.â"
Real Sociedad threaten to walk away from stalling Donny van de Beek talks,"Aug 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/real-sociedad-threaten-walk-away-stalling-donny-van-de-beek-talks,"Manchester Unitedâs hopes of offloading fringe midfielder Donny van de Beek to Real Sociedad have taken a hit amid stalled talks, 90min understands. Van de Beek was a Ballon dâOr nominee in 2019 thanks to his starring role for Erik ten Hagâs Ajax team on their journey to getting within seconds of the Champions League final. But a cruel combination of difficulty adapting to more physical English football, injuries, poor form and a lack of confidence has seen the Dutchman struggle to make an impact at Old Trafford, even after being reunited with former boss and mentor Ten Hag last season. As 90min has reported, Van de Beek has been exploring his options to leave throughout the summer, with his agents in contact with a number of European clubs. That follow decisions from Ten Hag, who retains a healthy relationship, and the club to give him permission to move on. In addition to AC Milan, Inter and Roma, there was Premier League interest from Wolves, Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace, plus from Celtic north of the Scottish border. feed An offer from Real Sociedad came in early August, with the Spanish club proposing a loan with option to buy ahead of their return to the Champions League this season. However, a problem has arisen. 90min understands that the two clubs have so far been unable to come to an agreement over the exact make up of the deal. Van de Beek himself remains particularly keen and so there is still an underlying expectation that it will happen, but there is now a threat of Real Sociedad potentially walking away altogether. United have already successfully offloaded Fred to Fenerbahce, raising Â£13m in the process, and departures from the midfield are important to free up space on the wage bill as the club continues to target Fiorentina and Morocco star Sofyan Amrabat."
Man Utd negotiating Benjamin Pavard transfer fee with Bayern Munich,"Aug 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-negotiating-benjamin-pavard-transfer-fee-bayern-munich,"Manchester United are in talks with Bayern Munich over the possible transfer of 2018 World Cup-winning defender Benjamin Pavard, 90min understands. The versatile Pavard, capable of playing as a centre-back or right-back, joined Bayern in 2019 and has entered the final year of his contract at the Allianz Arena. With Maguire in the process of leaving Old Trafford before next monthâs transfer deadline, Pavard had been among a number of options to replace the former captain. As 90min revealed last week, United are preparing to enter the transfer market once Maguireâs exit is completed. The England international had initially wanted to stay and fight for his place, despite slipping down the pecking order last season and losing the captaincy early in pre-season. feed But the Red Devils agreed a Â£30m fee with fellow Premier League side West Ham United. Talks have continued to hammer out the details of the proposed deal, although things have progressed slower than had been hoped. That being said, all parties expect a conclusion to still be reached soon. Pavard has been offered to United, with Niceâs Jean-Clair Todibo, ex-Ajax defender Perr Schuurs, Jarrad Branthwaite of Everton, one-time Tottenham target Edmond Tapsoba and Benficaâs Antonio Silva all considered by the club to replace Maguire. But it is the Pavard path on which United are now progressing and 90min understands that negotiations with Bayern over the transfer fee are taking place. The perennial German champions value the Frenchman at Â£30m (â¬35m), which is higher than the Â£25.9m (â¬30m) that United have so far proposed. That figure hasnât yet convinced Bayern to sell, but the difference in valuation has not dissuaded the sides from continuing to talk."

Chelsea confident of beating Liverpool to record Moises Caicedo transfer,"Aug 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-confident-beating-liverpool-record-moises-caicedo-transfer,"Chelsea are confident that they are close to finalising a British record transfer for Brighton & Hove Albion, sources have confirmed to 90min. Liverpool had agreed a deal with Brighton to sign Caicedo on Thursday evening worth Â£111m and the 21-year-old was due on Merseyside for a medical on Friday morning. However, it quickly became apparent that Caicedo was not going to travel to the north of England as he and his agents made it clear to Brighton that he would still prefer a move to Chelsea. The Blue had previously seen a number of bids rejected, the biggest of which had been worth Â£80m and was still someway short of the minimum Â£100m asking price required by the Seagulls. Now, whilst an agreement is not yet finalised, 90min has been informed that talks are progressing between Chelsea and Brighton and the deal is set to be worth in excess of the Â£111m fee agreed with Liverpool earlier in the week. Once confirmed, it would break Chelsea's own British record which they set in January when signing Enzo Fernandez from Benfica in a deal worth Â£106m 90min can also confirm that talks between Caicedo have accelerated to the point that personal terms are all finalised and the Ecuadorian is ready to put pen to paper on an eight-year contract as soon as the two clubs confirm an agreement over price is in place. feed Chelsea are hopeful that they could parade both Caicedo and Romeo Lavia, who is close to finalising move from Southampton after a Â£55m fee was agreed, ahead of Sunday's Premier League clash with, ironically, Liverpool, who not only wanted Caicedo but also had multiple bids for Lavia rejected.

Why would Real Madrid want to sign Kepa Arrizabalaga?,"Aug 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/why-would-real-madrid-want-to-sign-kepa-arrizabalaga,"Real Madrid have suffered a devastating blow on the eve of the new La Liga season, losing their goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois to an anterior cruciate ligament injury. The Belgian colossus has been pivotal to Madrid's success in recent years and Carlo Ancelotti hasn't had to think twice about who to start between the sticks.

Ancelotti needs a replacement for his number one, and has looked towards his old club Chelsea for a solution. Madrid have expressed their interest in taking Blues goalkeeper Kepa on loan for next season, a deal which Chelsea may be willing to sanction given their recent acquisition of Robert Sanchez. Here's why Real Madrid want Kepa at the Bernabeu. Considering Real Madrid will be relying on Andriy Lunin in their season opener against Athletic Club, Kepa's experience and quality would be a welcome addition to Los Blancos' squad. The Spanish stopper managed 39 appearances after reclaiming his starting spot from Edouard Mendy at Chelsea last year, including two encounters with Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals. Kepa performed admirably given the criticism he has received in previous seasons, establishing himself as the club's guaranteed number one. Kepa ranked in the top 24% of Premier League goalkeepers for saves (3.16), save percentage (73.3%) and goals against (1.16) per 90 last campaign. He also boasted a +0.18 rate when it came to post-shot expected goals  minus goals conceded, suggesting that Kepa was performing significantly above average in terms of his shot-stopping. His ability and competence outside of his own penalty area could also be crucial for Madrid. He ranked in the top 17% of Premier League goalkeepers for number of defensive actions per 90 outside of his box (1.82), showcasing his quality in sweeping up opposition balls over the top. While not as significant in an Ancelotti team, it will still allow Madrid to press higher up the pitch, knowing Kepa can sniff out danger when direct balls are played in behind the defence.  Overall, Kepa provides Madrid with a cost-effective and experienced option. Add this to the fact that he is Spanish and knows La Liga intimately, and it seems like something of a no-brainer for Madrid, especially if they are only exploring a loan deal. Club Appearances Saves Save percentage Clean sheets Chelsea 162 379 69.4% 57 Athletic Club 54 134 67.7% 15 Real Valladolid 40 161 77.8% 12 Ponferradina 19 51 72.9% 8 *All stats courtesy of FBref feed Despite having initially prioritised a move for Sevilla goalkeeper Yassine Bounou, the asking price for the Moroccan appears to be a stumbling block stopping the deal from progressing. Attention has therefore turned to Kepa, who has also interested Bayern Munich, but Real Madrid don't want to rush into making a signing given the multitude of options potentially available to them. Kepa, however, is under serious consideration, with Courtois set for a long spell on the sidelines. At present, Madrid are said to only be interested in loaning the 28-year-old from Chelsea, although such a deal could have an option to buy or mandatory buy clause inserted into it. Given Chelsea's expensive pursuit of Moises Caicedo and Romeo Lavia, a permanent deal that could recoup some transfer funds may be preferential."
Jurgen Klopp confirms Liverpool exit stance for Saudi linked star,"Aug 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jurgen-klopp-confirms-liverpool-exit-saudi-star,"Jurgen Klopp has confirmed he does not expect Liverpool to part ways with midfielder Thiago Alcantara this summer. Thiago is the latest Liverpool midfielder to attract interest from Saudi Arabia, with reports suggesting a reunion with Roberto Firmino at Al Ahli could be on the cards. Liverpool have already sold both Jordan Henderson and Fabinho to Saudi Arabia, while James Milner, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Naby Keita have departed on free transfers, leaving Klopp's side a little light in midfield. As a result, there are no plans to offload Thiago, who is back in training after recovery from a hip injury. ""Heâs now training, he came in and asked about his role and we spoke,"" Klopp told his pre-match press conference before Liverpool's opening Premier League game of the new season. ""[Heâs a] super experienced player, he stepped up in that department. He has only been in team training for a week but very vocal, he is going to be very helpful for us."" feed Liverpool continue to search for midfield reinforcements and have been in talks over both Brighton's Moises Caicedo and Southampton's Romeo Lavia. A British record deal of Â£111m was agreed for the former but interest from Chelsea has proven to be a real problem. The Blues had been chasing Caicedo all summer and the Ecuador international is understood to be prioritising a move to Stamford Bridge as a result. Meanwhile, Chelsea are also closing in on a deal for Lavia, for whom Liverpool had three bids rejected before igniting their pursuit of Caicedo. Liverpool's third offer for Lavia stood at Â£46m - short of Southampton's Â£50m asking price - but Chelsea are pursuing an agreement which would be worth Â£55m. Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai have already arrived at Anfield, adding significant creative ability to Liverpool's ranks."
Kepa Arrizabalaga among Real Madrid options after Yassine Bounou talks stall,"Aug 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/kepa-arrizabalaga-real-madrid-yassine-bounou-talks-stall,"Real Madrid are prepared to end their pursuit of Sevilla goalkeeper Yassine Bounou after seeing his asking price raised, 90min understands, with Chelsea's Kepa Arrizabalaga now among the club's top targets. Madrid lost usual starter Thibaut Courtois to an ACL injury earlier this week, with the Belgian stopper set to spend the majority of the coming campaign on the sidelines as a result. Sevilla's Yassine Bounou was initially targeted as a replacement after an asking price of â¬20m (Â£17.3m) was quoted, but sources have confirmed to 90min that Sevilla are now demanding upwards of â¬30m (25.9m) and Madrid are prepared to walk away as a result. Club officials have drawn up a long list of potential targets, including former Manchester United star David de Gea, but further contact has been made with Kepa as Madrid seek to explore all their options. Kepa has been targeted by Bayern Munich this week as the German side seek to replace their own injured goalkeeper, Manuel Neuer, but Madrid are now exploring a rival bid for the Chelsea man. feed Chelsea have already been active in the goalkeeper market this summer, selling Edouard Mendy to Al Ahli and replacing him with Robert Sanchez of Brighton, but the interest in Kepa has seen them reignite their search for a new stopper. Long-term target Giorgi Mamardashvili of Valencia remains on Chelsea's wish list, while the Blues are also known to have considered their own move for De Gea, who is available as a free agent following his departure from United. Porto's Diogo Costa has plenty of admirers at Stamford Bridge but is understood to be too expensive for the Blues, who are locked in talks over a double deal for Brighton's Moises Caicedo and Southampton's Romeo Lavia that could cost in excess of Â£160m. Madrid are relaxed about their quest for a new stopper, believing there are plenty of options available to them. Leeds United's Illan Meslier has also been added to the shortlist as the Spanish side continue their search. Publicly, manager Carlo Ancelotti has put his faith in usual deputy Andriy Lunin, who is expected to start in goal for Madrid against Athletic Club on Saturday, but a move for a new goalkeeper is expected to be made soon enough."

Barcelona president Joan Laporta is understood to be keen on a reunion with Neymar but manager Xavi has publicly claimed that the Brazilian is not part of the club's transfer plans. However, that hasn't stopped Roberto from reaching out to Neymar about a possible return to the club this summer. ""I'm excited because, at the end of the day, he's an ex-teammate who is a friend and with whom I have experienced many good things over many years,"" Roberto told SPORT. ""When he was in the team, they were some of the best years I've had at Barca, we won everything. ""He's a very different player from the others, I'm sure he would contribute a lot to us, but I'm not the one who decides. Those in charge of deciding whether to sign him or not will decide what is best for the club. What we want is to have the best team possible to compete for everything, and to have the best players."" feed Roberto went on to reveal that his conversations with Neymar have revolved around a summer transfer to Barcelona, even claiming the PSG winger is keen to get a deal done. Asked about those talks, Roberto added: ""I've talked to him. It's private. But yes, he's excited."" With Barcelona split over a potential move for Neymar, 90min understands that PSG are keen to take advantage of interest in the 31-year-old from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF).

Ousmane Dembele leaves Barcelona to join PSG on five-year deal,"Aug 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ousmane-dembele-leaves-barcelona-psg-five-year-deal,"Paris Saint-Germain have confirmed the signing of French winger Ousmane Dembele from Barcelona. Dembele had been in talks over extending his Barcelona contract before PSG voiced a desire to trigger the â¬50m release clause in the Frenchman's contract, and although that clause expired last month, Dembele's desire to seal the move saw Barcelona agree to the same terms. Having entered the final year of his contract at Camp Nou, Barcelona preferred to cash in on Dembele when it became clear he would leave for free next summer if he remained at the club. For Dembele, it's a return to Ligue 1 for the first time since he departed Rennes in 2016, with the 26-year-old inking a five-year contract at Parc des Princes. feed ""I'm delighted to be joining Paris Saint-Germain and can't wait to play for my new club,"" Dembele told club media.

Bayern Munich complete signing of Harry Kane from Tottenham,"Aug 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/breaking-bayern-munich-complete-signing-harry-kane-tottenham,"Bayern Munich have completed the long-awaited signing of Harry Kane from Tottenham Hotspur. The 30-year-old has signed a four-year contract with the Bundesliga giants, bringing the curtain down on a glittering Spurs career that saw him usurp Jimmy Greaves as the club's all-time record goalscorer. Kane has been Bayern's primary target this summer, as the Bavarians look to finally replace the guaranteed goals of Robert Lewandowski, and have finally got a deal over the line after months of negotiating with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy. 90min understands that Bayern will pay â¬100m (Â£86.4m) to Tottenham for Kane, but the deal could be worth more should potential add-ons be triggered. ""Bayern is one of the biggest clubs in the world, and Iâve always said that I want to compete and prove myself at the highest level during my career,"" Kane told Bayern's media team after confirmation of the move. ""This club is defined by its winning mentality."" Kane leaves the Premier League widely regarded as one of the greatest strikers of the modern era. A Spurs academy graduate quickly dubbed 'one of our own', he broke into the first team towards the back end of the 2013/14 season, before scoring 21 Premier League goals and 31 in all competitions the following year. manual The club's famous number 10 shirt was soon his, and Kane continued to deliver the goods for Tottenham in addition to becoming one of England's best players. He won multiple Premier League Player of the Month awards (seven in total) and was named in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year five times. Kane also bagged the Premier League Golden Boot three times, though his career-best 30 goals during the 2017/18 season was not enough to earn him the gong ahead of Mohamed Salah. That goal haul was matched last season despite Tottenham's struggles in the Premier League, and it was apparent that Kane, who came close to leaving the club a couple of years ago to join Manchester City, may need to leave in order to fulfil his trophy ambitions. With just a year left on his contract, Real Madrid and Manchester United were expected to pounce, but it's Bayern Munich who have got a deal over the line after months of courting. Kane is believed to have been registered in time to play in Saturday's night German Super Cup final against RB Leipzig - a game that could see Kane lift the first silverware of his club career less than 24 hours after arriving in Germany."

Lavia has not made a competitive appearance for Southampton this season due to intense speculation regarding a move away. Chelsea and Liverpool's transfer business in recent days has been intertwined.

Carlo Ancelotti explains how Real Madrid will cope without Thibaut Courtois,"Aug 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/carlo-ancelotti-how-real-madrid-will-cope-without-thibaut-courtois,"Carlo Ancelotti has insisted Real Madrid have total faith in Ukraine international Andriy Lunin as they consider their goalkeeping options in the wake of Thibaut Courtois' injury. Courtois is set to undergo surgery after tearing his ACL in training and is subsequently expected to miss the vast majority of the upcoming campaign, leaving Madrid with Lunin as their only senior goalkeeper. As 90min reported following Courtois' injury, Madrid have not yet ruled out keeping Lunin as their starting goalkeeper, although club officials are drawing up a list of potential targets as they seek to bolster in the position once again.

However, with Lunin set to start the campaign in goal as Madrid open their season against Athletic Club on Saturday, Ancelotti reiterated his faith in the 24-year-old. feed ""Emotionally, it was not a good day,"" Ancelotti told a press conference. ""We are sad on a personal level as it is an injury to an important player, but these things happen in football. ""We wish [Courtois] a speedy recovery and we give all the confidence in the world to Lunin, who is a great goalkeeper. In pre-season, he did well. Total confidence in him, we think he is a talent. What he lacks is what everyone lacks, experience, but he will take it game by game."" Asked whether he would like a new signing, Ancelotti responded: ""We have time until 31 August. Behind Lunin, our goalkeepers have potential, but they are young. We will think about it. Fran [Gonzalez] is 17 years old. ""If we sign a new goalkeeper, we will do it for numbers because we have confidence in Lunin. The confidence in Lunin is total."" Ancelotti ended with a simple assessment of the sort of goalkeeper he would like to see Madrid bring in. âOne that stops the ball with his hands,"" the Italian quipped. ""First and foremost, one that makes saves. That is what I ask of all goalkeepers. Let them be good with their hands. When it comes to feet, it's better to have a striker."""

He is expected to become their starting striker once he returns to full fitness following a back injury, United have had a long-standing interest in Harry Kane, but they did not make any advances to Tottenham Hotspur this summer, and the 30-year-old is now set to join Bayern Munich after the two clubs agreed on an Â£86.4m fee.

United ironically travel to Tottenham next Saturday for their second Premier League fixture of the season, and could instead up against a forward line led by Son Heung-min and Richarlison, who spent most of last season on the bench despite costing the north Londoners Â£60m when joining from Everton. Hojlund won't be available for the Red Devils, as he nurses his back injury, and that could put the onus on Marcus Rashford to again score the goals for Ten Hag's side. The 25-year-old scored a career-best 30 in all competitions last season to earn a new five-year contract and status as the highest-paid player at the club."

Ange Postecoglou confirms Harry Kane transfer & how Tottenham will replace him,"Aug 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ange-postecoglou-confirms-harry-kane-transfer-how-tottenham-will-replace-him,"Tottenham Hotspur head coach Ange Postecoglou has admitted that Harry Kane was 'unlikely' to stay at the club this season ahead of his move to Bayern Munich. 90min reported on Thursday that Spurs had finally relented and accepted an Â£86.4m (â¬100m) bid from the German champions. Kane will fly to Germany on Friday to finalise the transfer. Spurs boss Postecoglou insisted last week that he simply wanted the saga resolved as soon as possible to plan for the season ahead. Ahead of Sunday's trip to Brentford for his Premier League debut, Postecoglou was understandably asked for an update on Kane. ""It's fair to say I don't have a blow by blow account of the whole thing but fair to say it's progressed to the point where it looks like it's going to happen. We move forward without Harry. It gives us clarity and unless something unforeseen happens we'll move on,"" he said. ""I didn't see the point in [pitching myself] because whatever I was going to say was going to be irrelevant. I could plan his grand vision but I'm sure he'd heard it all before. My feeling was we'll get to know each other, that's the best way to navigate this early bit. Having said that, in my mind after that initial conversation [on the first day], he'd made up his mind that if the clubs agreed he'd go but he was also happy to stay if they didn't. ""It's best Harry speaks for himself on the decision but there's no doubts he's one of the greats of this football club. His record speaks for himself. I'm only new in the building but I'm certainly not the spokesman for this football club in declaring people's status but I think it's clear Harry Kane is one of the greats. ""I think if you're involved in football as long as I have, you know clubs are not going to talk to each other without the player knowing. We weren't talking to Wolfsburg without knowing Micky van de Ven wanted to come. ""[Harry and I] had a chat on the first day. He was up front and honest that if they could agree a deal then he would go. He wanted it decided by the first game and that was my preference as well."" manual When asked how Tottenham will go about replacing Kane, Postecoglou added: ""I don't think there's a like for like replacement for Harry. We've been planning for this for a while to be fair. It doesn't take too much investigative work to know that this was going to happen. Our business up to now reflects that. ""I don't think it works that way [giving Daniel Levy a list of strikers to get]. It's not like the family shopping list to go and get milk and bread for the kids.

The Blues failed with an Â£80m offer and were considering returning with a bid closer to Brighton's Â£100m asking price when Liverpool swooped in and agreed a British record deal worth Â£111m to sign the 21-year-old. Nothing has been signed between Brighton and Liverpool, however, and sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea are refusing to accept defeat in the race. Chelsea have informed Caicedo's representatives that they are prepared to battle to try and sign the midfielder and will not give up hope until he has put pen to paper on a deal with Liverpool. As it stands, Chelsea have not made a new bid for Caicedo, with Liverpool the only side to have seen an offer accepted. Before Liverpool's offer arrived, 90min understood that Caicedo's preference was to join Chelsea this summer, with the midfielder repeatedly making it clear to Brighton that he wanted to be allowed to speak to the Blues. feed Caicedo has not yet travelled to Merseyside for a scheduled medical, 90min further understands, and Chelsea are using the time to try and work on a solution. Brighton are hoping to sell Caicedo to the highest bidder and wasted little time in accepting Liverpool's offer, which was significantly higher than any proposal put forward until now by Chelsea. The two clubs, who ironically meet in their opening Premier League fixture on Sunday, have also butted heads  over Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia. The Reds failed with three bids for the Belgian, the last of which was worth Â£46m, before Chelsea arrived with an offer of Â£48m. Southampton value Lavia at Â£50m and are not prepared to compromise on their price. Where Caicedo ends up remains to be seen, but the twists and turns of the transfer have made it one of the most fascinating sagas of what's been an extraordinary window to date."
Real Madrid turn attention to Sevilla goalkeeper after Thibaut Courtois injury,"Aug 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/real-madrid-sevilla-goalkeeper-thibaut-courtois-injury,"Real Madrid are preparing to move for Sevilla goalkeeper Yassine Bounou, 90min understands, as they look to cover the long-term absence of Thibaut Courtois. The Belgian suffered an ACL injury during a training session earlier this week and will soon undergo surgery, which will keep him on the sidelines for the vast majority of the 2023/24 La Liga season. With Ukraine international Andriy Lunin the only other goalkeeper in Carlo Ancelotti's squad, Madrid are prepared to enter the transfer market for a new stopper and have identified a number of potential targets. Contact has been made with former Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea, while Chelsea's Kepa Arrizabalaga is also seen as a candidate for a loan move, but sources have confirmed to 90min that Bounou is at the top of Madrid's wish list. 32-year-old Bounou, who excelled with Morocco at the World Cup, has made 157 appearances in La Liga across his career, emerging as one of the division's most-reliable stoppers since his switch to Sevilla in 2020. feed 90min understands that Bounou has made it clear he would like the chance to move to Madrid and Sevilla are prepared to do business for a fee of around â¬20m (Â£17.3m). Madrid were not planning to do any additional business after an expensive shopping spree which brought Jude Bellingham, Arda Guler, Fran Garcia and Joselu to the club, but Courtois' serious injury has forced them back into the market. While club officials are understood to be fans of Lunin, there is a desire to bring in a goalkeeper with more La Liga experience as Ancelotti seeks to wrestle the league title back from rivals Barcelona. Defence was a real issue for Ancelotti during pre-season, with the Spanish side conceding eight goals across four games, and the injury to Courtois has only complicated his attempted solution."
Jurgen Klopp: I was wrong about huge transfer fees,"Aug 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jurgen-klopp-i-was-wrong-huge-transfer-fees,"Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp admits his previous comments on heavy spending were wrong  in the wake of the Reds' Â£111m agreement to sign Moises Caicedo from Brighton. Caicedo is set to become the most expensive signing in the history of English football after Liverpool agreed to pay Brighton Â£111m to sign the midfielder, but critics were quick to recall Klopp's previous criticisms of such heavy spending. Indeed, in 2016, Klopp was left stunned by Manchester United's Â£89m acquisition of Paul Pogba - a world record at the time - and vowed he would never pull the trigger on such a deal. ""The day that this is football, I'm not in a job anymore, because the game is about playing together,"" Klopp said at the time. ""Other clubs can go out and spend more money and collect top players. I want to do it differently. I would even do it differently if I could spend that money."" feed Having now agreed to sign Caicedo for Â£111m in the same summer as Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister moved to Liverpool for a combined Â£95m, Klopp confessed the market has been thrown into turmoil since his comments on Pogba. ""Everything changed,"" he told a press conference on Friday. ""Do I like it? No, but did I realise I was wrong? Definitely. Definitely. That's the way it goes. It's not great, it's not top. Saudi Arabia will not help with that. I'm not blaming it, but another market with a lot of money. ""In the end, we as a club, we have to try make sure that we, with our resources, get the best possible team together. We try everything to bring together the best squad for us, and we are not in dreamland, so it's not like we can just point at players and bring them in. ""If people want to throw my quotes from five or six years ago at me, no problem. That's what I thought that day, and I realise now I was wrong, easy to admit that."""
Jurgen Klopp explains why Liverpool can afford Moises Caicedo but not Jude Bellingham,"Aug 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jurgen-klopp-why-liverpool-afford-moises-caicedo-not-jude-bellingham,"Jurgen Klopp has admitted Liverpool did not expect to have the money to pursue Moises Caicedo when they pulled out of the race to sign Jude Bellingham earlier this summer. Bellingham was Liverpool's top target heading into the summer transfer window but, when the true cost of the deal was set, the Reds ultimately pulled out and Bellingham ended up joining Real Madrid for an initial Â£88.5m. Since then, however, Liverpool agreed to the surprise sales of both Jordan Henderson and Fabinho, who moved to Saudi Arabia, and Klopp admitted that unplanned income played a part in the Â£111m move for Caicedo. ""I can confirm that the deal with the club is agreed,"" Klopp told a press conference when asked about the Caicedo bid. ""What did change? We are a club, we have not endless resources, we didn't expect a couple of things happening in the summer - Hendo, Fab, stuff like this. We didn't think about this before the summer to be honest, and when it happened, we gave it a go. Obviously the club was really stretched, to be honest."" feed Klopp went on to insist he knew nothing else about Liverpool's move for Caicedo, stressing he had ""no idea"" whether the Ecuador international was due for a medical on Friday. The pursuit of Caicedo came after Liverpool had a third bid rejected for Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia. Chelsea went on to offer Â£48m for the Belgian shortly before the Reds took control of the Caicedo race. Asked whether signing Caicedo would end Liverpool's pursuit of Lavia, Klopp urged fans to wait and see how things play out. ""Let's talk about that if it happens,"" he said. ""It's nothing I can really say, that's the truth. Let's do it step by step, let's see what happens in the next hours or days and then go from there."""

Liverpool agree British record deal to sign Moises Caicedo,"Aug 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-agree-british-record-deal-sign-moises-caicedo,"Liverpool have agreed a British record deal worth Â£111m to sign Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo, 90min understands. The Reds opened talks with Brighton on Thursday as they pivoted from Southampton's Romeo Lavia to Caicedo and now terms are agreed between the two clubs. Caicedo had been Chelsea's prime midfield target all summer, but they baulked at the idea of meeting Brighton's value - which has always been at least Â£100m - while Liverpool's offer of Â£111m was immediately accepted. Such a deal would represent a British record, eclipsing the Â£106m Chelsea paid to land Enzo Fernandez in January. Chelsea made numerous offers for Caicedo, but their highest did not exceed Â£80m and now they have missed out on the Ecuador star who is destined for Anfield, where he will help form an overhauled midfield containing Hungarian star Dominik Szoboszlai and former Seagulls teammate Alexis Mac Allister. feed Caicedo is now due to head to Merseyside to complete his medical and is expected to sign his contract before this weekend's Premier League opener, which just so happens to come against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. For Liverpool, the deal is an obvious club record, eclipsing the Â£75m paid to sign centre-back Virgil van Dijk from Southampton in January 2018. While such an expensive move was not initially on the cards this summer, Liverpool raised significant funds through the unplanned sales of Jordan Henderson and Fabinho to Saudi Arabia and ultimately decided to pull the trigger. As for Chelsea, the Blues joined the bidding for Liverpool target Lavia earlier this week as they submitted a Â£48m offer for the Southampton midfielder, who has been valued at Â£50m. Chelsea have also confirmed their intention to trigger the Â£20m release clause of Leeds United midfielder Tyler Adams."
Harry Kane agrees to leave Tottenham for Bayern Munich,"Aug 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/harry-kane-agrees-leave-tottenham-bayern-munich,"Harry Kane is set to leave Tottenham Hotspur this summer after agreeing to join German champions Bayern Munich, 90min understands. Bayern lodged four bids for the England striker, eventually agreeing to a â¬100m (Â£86.4m) deal to lure Kane away, but the striker himself did not immediately give his approval to a move as he considered all his options. While the initial delay left Spurs feeling hopeful they may have convinced their captain to stay, 90min understands that Kane has now accepted Bayern's proposal and is set to leave the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this summer. Kane, who set a deadline of Sunday to resolve his future, is due in Germany on Friday to undergo a medical ahead of signing a four-year contract with the Bundesliga champions. However, Spurs have currently delayed signing off on the deal and are keen to finalise each and every minor detail before allowing Kane to depart. Bayern are hopeful that Kane will be in attendance for Saturday's Super Cup clash with RB Leipzig, perhaps even playing a role in the match if all goes to plan. feed The move to Germany, if sealed as expected, will bring an end to Kane's 19-year association with Tottenham, in which he has racked up 280 goals in 435 appearances. Kane's pursuit of Alan Shearer's all-time Premier League top scorer record will also be halted, perhaps permanently. The 30-year-old has struck 213 times in the competition, 47 fewer than Blackburn and Newcastle icon Shearer. While they had been hopeful of keeping Kane, Spurs have been exploring potential replacements for the England captain in anticipation of a departure. Argentina youth international Alejo Veliz has agreed to join but Spurs are also looking at the likes of Gent's Gift Orban, Montpellier's Elye Wahi and Lille's Jonathan David. Aleksandar Mitrovic of Fulham is also on Spurs' radar. The Serb was keen to leave for Saudi Arabia earlier this summer but has seen a move blocked by Fulham, who are demanding Â£50m to part ways with their star striker."
Potential Thibaut Courtois replacements at Real Madrid - ranked,"Aug 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/potential-thibaut-courtois-replacements-real-madrid-ranked,"Real Madrid are now in the market for a new goalkeeper after Thibaut Courtois suffered a potential season-ending injury this week.  The Belgian shot-stopper suffered an ACL injury which will unfortunately require surgery and an extremely lengthy spell on the sidelines.  In the imemdiate term Andriy Lunin will stand in. But here's the options available to Madrid in what remains of this summer transfer window in order to replace the stricken Courtois... feed Diogo Costa is the best goalkeeper on this list. That is a fact. The Porto star is an archtypal modern goalie who is as equally with the ball at his feet as he is in between the sticks. So why is he the last on these options, you ask? Well the fact that he has a Â£65m (â¬75m) release clause in his contract - something which we highly doubt Real Madrid would pay. Likelihood: 1/10 The 22-year-old has been consistently linked with a move away from Valencia in recent months, so it only makes sense to add him to list of potential Courtois deputies. The Â£25m asking price that Valencia have put on the goalkeeper makes any move unlikely however, especially when there's much, much cheaper options who would do as good a job currently on the market. Likelihood: 2/10  Recently linked with a move to Bayern, regular Premier League viewers are well aware of Kepa Arrizabalaga's deficiencies. He's not all bad though, and if Chelsea are desperate to get ride of him this summer then he could be available for an okay price.Kepa was actually heavily linked with Madrid once before, way back in 2018.Likelihood: 4/10  Even before the news broke that Thibaut Courtois was set to miss the majority of the season, David Soria was being linked with a move to the Santiago Bernabeu. A deal was reported to have fallen through in July due to a mixture of Getafe wanting Â£8m for his services and Soria not being keen on becoming a second choice goalkeeper. With the opportunity to become Madrid's first-choice shot-stopper for a season now available, Soria may be more keen to join the club. Likelihood: 6/10  Three UEFA Champions Leagues, one La Liga and four FIFA Club World Cups. It's fair to say that Keylor Navas enjoyed his previous stint at Real Madrid. His success at the club in the mid-2010s, coupled with his availability due to lowly position in the PSG goalkeeper ranks means this deal would make a lot of sense. Likelihood: 8/10  Once upon a time, David de Gea was a fax machine away from joining Real Madrid for around Â£30m.Now, Madrid can sign the goalkeeper as a free agent and not have worry about paying a fee or rely on a fax machine to work properly. He's the logical choice. Likelihood: 10/10"
Man Utd goalkeeper undergoing Bayer Leverkusen medical,"Aug 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-goalkeeper-undergoing-bayer-leverkusen-medical,"Manchester United goalkeeper Matej Kovar is on the verge of a permanent transfer away from the club as he undergoes a medical with Bayer Leverkusen, sources have confirmed to 90min. Now 23, Kovar has been with United since the age of 17. He joined from home-town club Solvacko in 2018 and has been loaned out to Swindon Town, Burton Albion and Sparta Prague during that time. It was his loan at Sparta last season that brought Kovar to wider attention. It was his very first year as a top flight starter and he helped the club win the Czech First League and return to the Champions League qualifying rounds. 90min reported in May that Kovarâs form on loan had caught the eye of his parent club. There were glowing reviews coming back from Prague and he was included in the thought process regarding the goalkeeping position long before Andre Onana was eventually signed. At a time when David de Gea was widely expected to sign a new contract at Old Trafford, United staff considered the possibility that Kovar could emerge as the Spaniardâs chief back-up and limit the need to spend big on a new goalkeeper. feed However, De Geaâs contract offer was later withdrawn and revised, ultimately leading to him leaving the club as a free agent. It accelerated the need for a readymade number one and so the club spent handsomely to sign Onana from Inter, reuniting the Cameroonian with Erik ten Hag. Kovar was briefly involved in Unitedâs pre-season programme, playing 135 minutes of the opening two summer friendlies against Leeds and Lyon. But his immediate future now lies elsewhere. 90min understands that a Â£7.8m (â¬9m) transfer fee has been agreed with Bayer Leverkusen and that a medical to complete the transfer is already being undertaken. Ties with Kovar have not been fully cut though, as United have retained a buy-back clause that could see him return to Manchester. Leverkusen finished sixth in the Bundesliga last season following a remarkable turnaround once Xabi Alonso was appointed head coach, having been flirting with relegation initially. It means that Kovar could have the chance to play Europa League football in 2023/24. He will compete with veteran Finland international and current Leverkusen captain Lukas Hradecky."
Man Utd agree Fred transfer fee with Turkish giants,"Aug 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-agree-fred-transfer-fee-turkish-giants,"Manchester United midfielder Fred is on course to join Fenerbahce after a deal was agreed with the Turkish Super Lig giants ahead of their fiercest rivals, 90min understands. Fred made 56 appearances for United last season, although he was primarily a back-up option and started only 12 times in the Premier League. The Brazilian has since also seen Mason Mount join the club, adding further competition for midfield places. It was the arrivals of both Christian Eriksen and Casemiro last summer that initially pushed him down the Old Trafford pecking order. Fulham had been interested in Fred, who joined United ahead of Manchester City from Shakhtar Donetsk for close to Â£50m in the summer of 2018, but were not prepared to meet the asking price. feed Nottingham Forest were also in touch with the playerâs representatives, but didnât take things further, while Roma made an enquiry too. As 90min reported at the time, Galatasaray had an offer rejected in mid-July because it fell short of the Â£20m asking price. Now, however, United have agreed to sell for less. The deal negotiated with Fenerbahce is worth Â£13m (â¬15m), inclusive of add-ons. Fred also resisted the opportunity to move to the Saudi Pro League, which has already welcomed the likes of NâGolo Kante, Fabinho, Jordan Henderson and Ruben Neves from the Premier League this summer."
Jean-Clair Todibo: Nice manager responds to Man Utd transfer interest,"Aug 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jean-clair-todibo-nice-manager-responds-man-utd-transfer-interest,"Nice manager Francesco Farioli has confessed Manchester United's interest in centre-back Jean-Clair Todibo could leave them powerless to keep the Frenchman. United are on the cusp of selling Harry Maguire to West Ham United for Â£30m and have identified former Barcelona defender Todibo as a potential replacement for the Englishman. One of the top performers in Ligue 1 last season, Todibo is rated incredibly highly by everyone at Nice, including new manager Farioli, but while the boss wants to keep Todibo, he admitted he could not guarantee no business would be done. ""I also have two vice-captains Khephren Thuram and Jean-Clair Todibo who are among the best players in the team,"" Farioli told the media. ""We would like both players to stay until the end of the season, but you cannot escape the reality of the transfer window. We'll see what happens. As long as they're here, I'm enjoying having them."" feed He continued: ""Of course we would like Todibo to stay, but it can be complicated. We have to wait to see who will want to buy him and if everyone finds an agreement there.  ""He is a leader, a very strong player mentally, he has improved a lot and he is ready to reach the very top level."" United have drawn up a sizeable list of potential replacements for Maguire. Alongside Todibo, there is also interest in Torino's Perr Schuurs and Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite, while Bayer Leverkusen's Edmond Tapsoba is seen as an expensive alternative. The Red Devils have also been offered the chance to sign versatile Bayern Munich defender Benjamin Pavard, who is in the final year of his contract and is expected to be available for a fee similar to the Â£30m United are in line to receive for Maguire."
Tottenham hopeful of Harry Kane stay despite Bayern Munich agreement,"Aug 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-hopeful-harry-kane-stay-bayern-munich-agreement,"Harry Kane has not yet accepted Bayern Munich's offer of a summer transfer, 90min understands, with Tottenham Hotspur hopeful their talisman will instead agree to stay. Having seen Kane enter the final year of his contract, Spurs have begrudgingly accepted a bid from Bayern worth â¬100m (Â£86.4m) but have long been determined to convince the England international to reject their advances and stay. While Bayern were confident an agreement with Spurs was all that was missing in their pursuit of Kane, sources have confirmed to 90min that the 30-year-old has not yet given his approval to a move to Munich. Kane is understood to be considering his options, one of which is to remain with Spurs beyond this summer, and sources close to the club are now hopeful that Kane will agree to remain at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for at least one more season. The striker informed both Spurs and Bayern earlier this week that he wanted his future resolved by the time the new Premier League season kicks off this weekend, with Spurs due to play Brentford on Sunday. feed Bayern themselves wanted a deal wrapped up when they lodged a third bid which was also worth â¬100m, but based around a less-favourable payment structure for the Premier League side. But they did not get the immediate response they were hoping for as Spurs chairman Daniel Levy delayed his eventual rejection. They have now seen a bid accepted which would satisfy Kane's deadline but the striker has not yet given the green light - a hesitance which has left Spurs optimistic about their chances of keeping the striker. Should Kane stay, he would be able to discuss a free transfer overseas in January, with Spurs at risk of losing him for free next summer, when Premier League rivals would also be able to offer a contract. Spurs have long been determined to keep Kane and have never given up on convincing the England captain to sign a new contract further down the line."
Man Utd target explains why he rejected Old Trafford transfer this summer,"Aug 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-target-explains-why-rejected-old-trafford-transfer,"Japanese goalkeeper Zion Suzuki has confirmed he turned down a move to Manchester United this summer amid concerns over the minutes available to him. After David de Gea's departure on a free transfer, United began looking for two new goalkeepers and were reported to have lined up 20-year-old Suzuki, then of Japanese side Urawa Red Diamonds, as a possible backup to new number one Andre Onana. Suzuki had other plans, however, taking his talents to Belgium and joining Sint-Truiden on loan with a view to a permanent transfer next summer. While Suzuki admitted he would love to play for United in future, he confessed that he did not want to sit on the bench behind Â£47.2m signing Onana. feed ""I decided to transfer this time as a step up in aiming to be the best in the world. It's true that there was an offer from Manchester United,"" Suzuki told the media. ""As a football player and as a person, if I hadn't thought about anything, of course, I would like to go to Manchester United, but among them, I really want to spend time thinking about what kind of future awaits me. After much thought, I made this decision. ""Manchester United have acquired Onana. It's important for me to participate in matches, and I think it is also important to play on the world stage. I want to make the most of what I have learned here and do my best."" Despite his initial rejection, Suzuki confirmed he dreams of making the move to the Premier League and flying the flag for his country. ""While many players are active overseas, it is difficult to become a keeper,"" he concluded. ""I think we are going to have a really tough battle ahead of us in that position. ""There are still no Japanese who are active as goalkeepers in the Premier League, so I want to be one of the first players to do so. I want to keep moving forward step by step."""
Kylian Mbappe: PSG forward reinforces stance over summer exit,"Aug 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/kylian-mbappe-psg-stance-summer-exit,"Kylian Mbappe has reiterated his desire to stay with Paris Saint-Germain and see out the remainder of his contract in the French capital, 90min understands. The 24-year-old shocked PSG earlier this summer when he told them he would not be exercising the option to extend his contract, which is set to expire in June next year. PSG have responded by trying to sell Mbappe this summer, in a desperate bid to avoid losing one of the world's best players on a free transfer, but he has made it clear on numerous occasions that he intends to leave next year as a free agent. The Ligue 1 giants even accepted a world record offer of Â£257m (â¬300m) from Al Hilal last month, but despite putting forward a gargantuan contract offer to Mbappe, the PIF-backed Saudi Pro League side were unable to persuade the World Cup Golden Boot winner to enter negotiations. Chelsea have also been contracted by PSG in a bid to drum up further interest in Mbappe, as have a number of other heavyweight European clubs. Mbappe was left out of PSG's recent pre-season tour of Japan and has been banished from first-team duties as the dispute between player and club rages on - sources have told 90min that club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has even warned Fayza Lamari, his mother and agent, that Mbappe will 'not put a PSG shirt on again.' manual Despite the hostile atmopshere, Mbappe's position on the matter remains unchanged. 90min understands that he intends to spend the next 12 months in Paris before moving on to his next venture, which many believe will be at Real Madrid, and he has informed PSG of his plan. Sources close to Mbappe and Real Madrid have vehemently denied that an agreement is already in place for him to move to the Spanish capital next summer, but he came within a whisker of joining Madrid in 2022 before a last-minute change of heart saw him sign a new contract at PSG. Mbappe's sidelining is part of a radical overhaul at PSG this summer. Lionel Messi has already departed for Inter Miami, while the Parisiens are also keen to ship out Neymar. He has interest in his services from Saudi Arabia, with a potential return to Barcelona also rumoured in recent weeks."
West Ham weighing up offer for in-demand Montpellier striker Elye Wahi,"Aug 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-weighing-up-offer-montpellier-elye-wahi,"West Ham United have contacted Montpellier over striker Elye Wahi and are weighing up an offer, 90min understands. The Hammers confirmed their first major signing of the summer on Thursday, committing Edson Alvarez to a five-year contract after agreeing to pay Ajax up to Â£34m for his services. Â£30m deals are also in place for Southampton captain James Ward-Prowse and Manchester United defender Harry Maguire, while West Ham also have eyes on signing a new striker, wide forward and left back before the window closes on September 1 â the club have money to spend after selling Declan Rice to Arsenal for a British-record fee of Â£105m. 90min previously revealed that West Ham had shown an interest in 20-year-old Wahi, who bagged 19 goals for Montpellier in Ligue 1, amid concerns that Saudi Pro League side Al Ettifaq, managed by Steven Gerrard, may try to prise Michail Antonio away from London Stadium. That move hasn't come to fruition but Gianluca Scamacca has departed West Ham, joining Atalanta on a permanent basis. His exit has left the club a little light up front, with Antonio, Danny Ings and academy striker Divin Mubama the options at David Moyes' disposal. Sources have now confirmed to 90min that West Ham have made contact with Montpellier over Wahi - a player admired by technical director Tim Steidten - with a view to making an offer for the France Under-21 international. feed But getting a deal over the line won't be easy. Wahi has generated considerable interest this summer, with Arsenal and Chelsea among his Premier League suitors - the latter have been made a verbal offer. Ligue 1 giants Monaco are also considering a bid, though crucially they can't offer European football this season like West Ham can, and Eintracht Frankfurt think Wahi could be the ideal fit to replace Randal Kolo Muani. Kolo Muani has been strongly linked with Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich this summer, as well as Manchester United, and 90min understands that West Ham have enquired about his potential price tag too - PSG are leading the charge though as they cast Kylian Mbappe to one side in a furious dispute over his future, and it looks increasingly likely that Kolo Muani will return to Ligue 1 if a fee can be agreed. Montpellier are expected to demand a fee of at least Â£35m for Wahi, though they still may look to keep him after renewing his contract just six months ago. West Ham's other major piece of business surrounds the interest from Premier League champions Manchester City in Lucas Paqueta. A verbal Â£70m offer was swiftly rejected by the Hammers, who don't want to sell the Brazilian, but it's expected that the treble winners will imminently return with an improved bid."
Chelsea trigger Â£20m release clause in contract of Leeds midfielder,"Aug 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-trigger-20m-release-clause-leeds-midfielder,"Chelsea have triggered the release clause in the contract of Leeds United midfielder Tyler Adams, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Whites were relegated from the Premier League last season, activating a Â£20m clause that allows Adams to leave Elland Road if a bidding club is prepared to pay in full. 90min revealed on Monday that Chelsea had contacted the representatives of Adams over a move to west London, and personal terms are now being discussed with the 24-year-old United States international. The Blues have also informed Leeds of their intention to pay Adams' release clause in full, and he is expected to undergo a medical within the next 24 hours. Adams is seen as a shrewd signing by those in charge at Stamford Bridge, who are working to provide manager Mauricio Pochettino with the midfield reinforcements he has publicly requested this summer. feed Chelsea are working on a number of midfield signings and recently launched a bid to rival Liverpool for Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia, who has been on the Blues' radar for over 12 months now. After Liverpool saw a Â£46m bid rejected for Lavia, Chelsea put forward an offer of Â£48m, though that remains short of Southampton's Â£50m asking price. Chelsea are also continuing to work on an agreement for Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo, whose Â£100m asking price has so far proven problematic. Liverpool have also made late contact with Brighton over potentially rivalling Chelsea's latest offer, which sat at Â£80m, but have not progressed talks to the point of making a formal offer."
West Ham confirm signing of Edson Alvarez from Ajax,"Aug 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-confirm-signing-edson-alvarez-ajax,"West Ham United have finalised the signing of midfielder Edson Alvarez from Ajax. The Hammers have been exploring how to spend the Â£105m earned by Declan Rice's sale to Arsenal and have begun their shopping spree with a move for Alvarez, who 90min understands will set West Ham back around Â£34m if all add-ons are met. Alvarez, 25, has signed a five-year contract at London Stadium to become West Ham's first addition of the summer. ""I am very happy and very proud to be here,"" Alvarez told club media. ""Being here in London and seeing London Stadium, itâs amazing. I canât wait to play here in front of the West Ham fans. ""Itâs a hugely sentimental moment for me in my career. To join a club like a West Ham is a dream for me and my family.  ""The Premier League is a special league, the best league in the world and I think my style will suit it. I now have a responsibility to West Ham and the West Ham family and I will give absolutely everything for the shirt."" feed Manager David Moyes added: ""Weâre really pleased to add Edson to our squad. The midfield area was one we were especially keen to strengthen this summer â and Edson will complement the other options we have in that department. ""Heâs an experienced international player, who has enjoyed great success for both club and country during his career to date."" ""Weâre excited about welcoming to West Ham and seeing him play his part in English and European competition for the Club."" West Ham's spending may just be getting started after bids of Â£30m for both Southampton's James Ward-Prowse and Manchester United's Harry Maguire were accepted."
Liverpool make approach to rival Chelsea for Brighton's Moises Caicedo,"Aug 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-make-approach-to-rival-chelsea-brighton-moises-caicedo,"Liverpool have held talks over potentially trumping Chelsea's latest offer for Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo, 90min understands. Chelsea have seen multiple bids for Caicedo rejected already this summer, with Brighton holding out for Â£100m. While talks between the two sides remain on, Chelsea have also stepped up their pursuit of potential alternatives. Indeed, a bid was recently lodged for Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia - the subject of three failed offers from Liverpool. With Chelsea threatening to hijack the pursuit of Lavia, sources have confirmed to 90min that Liverpool have made a late move over potentially beating Mauricio Pochettino's side to Caicedo. Sources have stressed that Liverpool have not yet submitted a formal offer for Caicedo but have held talks with Brighton as they explore a possible move to exceed Chelsea's Â£80m proposal. feed 90min understands that Caicedo's preference would be to join Chelsea over Liverpool, but it remains to be seen whether that stance would change if the Reds see an offer accepted. Chelsea sources insist that the Blues remain well in the fight for Caicedo as well as Lavia, with Leeds United's Tyler Adams another target on the table. Liverpool are desperate to continue bolstering their midfield after the surprise departures of Jordan Henderson and Fabinho to Saudi Arabia, and Jurgen Klopp's side have spent a large part of the summer focused on Lavia. Three bids have been knocked back by Southampton, the latest of which was worth around Â£46m, and Chelsea have moved to try and win the race for Lavia with an offer of Â£48m - Â£2m short of the Saints' Â£50m asking price."
Vitor Roque: Athletico Paranaense rule out summer Barcelona switch,"Aug 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/vitor-roque-athletico-paranaense-rule-out-summer-barcelona-switch,"Athletico Paranaense CEO Alexandre Mattos has insisted that Vitor Roque will not join Barcelona until January 2024.  Barcelona confirmed the Â£34m (â¬40m) signing of Roque in July, with the agreement seeing the teenage striker remain with his current employers until the end of the calendar year before making the move to Spain in January 2024. Rumours have began to swirl in recent weeks that Barca could try to bring the move forward due to the sale of Ousmane Dembele to Paris Saint-Germain, with manager Xavi now potentially needing more reinforcements after the Frenchman's surprise departure. However, Mattos has now shut down the speculation, insisting Roque will not leave the club until 2024. feed ""There's no chance for Vitor Roque to leave and join Barcelona in August,"" he told Fabrizio Romano. ""He will leave in January, that was the pact with Barca and it will be respected.  ""We need him for the final 20 games and to qualify for the 2024 Copa Libertadores.""  In a recent interview, Roque's agent discussed how his client is already preparing for his move to the Catalan club. ""Vitor is very calm, he will not have any anxiety. He is already doing Catalan classes, he wants to arrive speaking Catalan and Spanish. Everything will work out,"" agent Andre Cury said. ""When his signing was closed he was elated, but he is already focused on Athletico Paranaense. He will know how to wait for the right moment to become the main man at Barca and make history."""
Juventus fans storm training pitch to protest potential Romelu Lukaku transfer,"Aug 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/juventus-fans-protest-potential-romelu-lukaku-transfer,"Juventus' training match against Juventus Next Gen was interrupted on Wednesday by a pitch invasion which saw supporters protest a possible move for Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku. The clubs have spoken this summer about a possible deal for Lukaku which would also see Dusan Vlahovic head to Stamford Bridge, but while Chelsea appreciate the Serbian striker, 90min understands they have a huge issue with Juve's demand for an extra Â£35m as part of the deal. These negotiations came after Lukaku's proposed return to Inter collapsed when the Italian side learned of talks between Juventus and the Belgian, who had privately and publicly vowed never to play for any Serie A side other than Inter. As a result, Lukaku's proposed move to the Allianz Stadium has not gone down well among fans, many of whom were heard screaming ""No, we don't want Lukaku"" during Wednesday's friendly - chants which initially began in the stands during the first minute of the game. It's worth noting that this game between Juventus and Juventus Next Gen took the place of the annual Villar Perosa friendly, in which it is tradition for fans to invade the pitch. But while the event is usually full of positivity as fans get the chance to meet players, a large number of supporters chose to use the opportunity to oppose a move for Lukaku instead. Invasione (anche senza Villar Perosa) #Juve pic.twitter.com/zpGsQcm7Ko Sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea are no longer entertaining the idea of a swap deal between Lukaku and Vlahovic as they do not share Juventus' valuation of the latter, but the Blues are still open to a straight sale if the right bid arrives for Lukaku. Options for Lukaku, who rejected an approach from Saudi Arabia earlier this summer, are proving limited after Inter closed the door on a potential transfer. ""Given what Inter has done for him, we expected him to behave differently, as a professional and as a man,"" Inter vice-president Javier Zanetti told La Gazzetta dello Sport. ""He has the right to go where he wants, of course, but he could have told us that beforehand. Nobody is bigger than the club and when building a team, you always have to consider who you are bringing into the dressing room."""

Should Kane opt to leave, Spurs could ramp up their interest in a new striker. 90min understands club representatives have spoken to the likes of Gent's Gift Orban, Lille's Jonathan David, Montpellier's Elye Wahi and Fulham's Aleksandar Mitrovic over potential moves."

Chelsea launch bid for Liverpool target Romeo Lavia,"Aug 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-launch-bid-liverpool-target-romeo-lavia,"Chelsea have launched a bid worth Â£48m for Southampton's in-demand midfielder Romeo Lavia, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Blues are looking to bring in a couple of midfielders this month to bolster Mauricio Pochettino's options and Lavia has emerged as one of their prime targets. Chelsea are already in talks with Brighton & Hove Albion over Moises Caicedo and have seen a number of bids for him rejected, but 90min understands that, while those talks are continuing, they have now also made a move for Lavia.

David Raya's transfer to Arsenal includes initial season-long loan,"Aug 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/david-raya-transfer-arsenal-initial-season-long-loan,"Arsenal will initially sign Brentford goalkeeper David Raya on a season-long loan with an option to then make the deal permanent in 2024, 90min understands. Raya has made it clear that he is ready to take the next step in his career, with Brentford repeatedly pointing suitors to a Â£40m price tag. That figure put Tottenham and Bayern Munich off pursuing a deal, but Arsenal were able to come to a Â£30m agreement earlier this week. It isnât a straight transfer though. 90min understands that the agreement will actually see Raya sign a one-year extension to his Brentford contract so that it then expires in the summer of 2025 instead of at the end of this season â that could have seen him walk away as a free agent. He will then join Arsenal on loan for the duration of the 2023/24 season, rather than outright. At the end of the loan, the Gunners will have an option to make it permanent for the total Â£30m already agreed. It is not, however, an obligation to buy. feed That gives Arsenal a get out option should Raya not succeed in establishing himself. In the same breath, should the Spaniard end up returning to Brentford, his value is protected by the contract extension and they would still have the opportunity to command a sizeable transfer fee. The proposed structure of the deal will financially benefit Arsenal, who have already splashed out more than Â£200m in transfer fees this summer on Kai Havertz, Jurrien Timber and Declan Rice. Hailing from Barcelona, Raya has spent his entire senior career in English football, having moved from Catalan club Cornella to Blackburnâs academy at the age of 16 almost a decade ago."

Real Madrid sell home-grown talent to La Liga club,"Aug 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/real-madrid-sell-home-grown-talent-la-liga-club,"Real Madrid have sold home-grown attacker Sergio Arribas to fellow La Liga club Almeria.

Man Utd target new centre-back signing as West Ham close on Harry Maguire,"Aug 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-target-new-centre-back-signing-west-ham-close-harry-maguire,"Manchester United are set to enter the transfer market to sign a new centre-back following the completion of Harry Maguire's Â£30m move to West Ham, 90min understands. Maguire is in discussions over a move to east London after being made available for transfer this summer by Erik ten Hag, who has already stripped the 30-year-old of the United captaincy. Maguire had initially wanted to stay and fight for his place but is now likely to proceed with his Old Trafford departure after talks between the clubs progressed this week. The England international arrived in 2019 for Â£80m, a world record transfer fee for a defender, but has suffered a difficult four years under successive managers Ten Hag, Ralf Rangnick and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He has lost his place entirely in the team under the Dutchman, who has not deemed Maguire suitable to execute the style of football he'd like to implement in Manchester. It had been part of Ten Hag's long-term plan to phase out and replace Maguire, despite his public suggestions otherwise, and now his departure is nearing completion, United are exploring names to replace his position in the squad. They have been offered Benjamin Pavard, a French World Cup winner who has been looking to leave Bayern Munich for the duration of the summer. He would carry the added bonus of being able to cover at right-back should he swap southern Germany for north west England. Bayern are open to letting Pavard leave and he'd likely cost United in the region of what they'd receive for Maguire. feed Nice centre-back Jean-Clair Todibo is a younger alternative at a similar price under consideration, while Liverpool target Perr Schuurs, now of Torino but formerly of Ten Hag's Ajax, is also liked behind the scenes. Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite is another central defender United have been following. Edmond Tapsoba, a Tottenham target who plays for Bayer Leverkusen, represents a more expensive option if United choose to go down that route, though it remains to be seen at present how much they are prepared to outlay and how ambitious they'd like to be with their replacement. Benfica's Antonio Silva is understood to be loved by club scouts but potentially the most expensive of those named. The club are looking to raise funds through the sales of a number of squad players - not just that of Maguire - and are close to moving Fred out of Old Trafford, with several parties interested in the Brazilian. Donny van de Beek is also set to depart for Real Sociedad in the coming weeks, with United pushing for a permanent deal, while Scott McTominay is still of interest to West Ham, who are now threatened by interest from Manchester City in Lucas Paqueta."
Bayern Munich consider moves for Kepa Arrizabalaga & David de Gea,"Aug 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-consider-kepa-arrizabalaga-david-de-gea,"Bayern Munich are continuing to scour the goalkeeper market and are now keeping tabs on Spanish duo Kepa Arrizabalaga and David de Gea, sources have confirmed to 90min. The German champions have been looking to add another stopper to their ranks while Manuel Neuer continues his recovery from a broken leg that he suffered during a skiing trip back in December. They had previously looked at Brentford's David Raya, but like Tottenham Hotspur refused to match the Â£40m valuation. The Bees have since agreed to sell him to Arsenal for Â£30m. With Yann Sommer signing for Inter in recent days, Bayern are stepping up their pursuit of a new goalkeeper. 90min understands they have made an enquiry to Chelsea regarding Kepa. feed The Blues are open to selling their current number one, who has two years left to run on his contract at Stamford Bridge, but Bayern's interest has not gone beyond this initial enquiry. Chelsea have brought in a goalkeeper of their own this transfer window, signing Robert Sanchez from Brighton for a fee in the region of Â£20m. 90min understands that Bayern are also considering making a contract offer to free agent De Gea, who has been without a club since July after leaving Manchester United. De Gea also has suitors in the Saudi Pro League and it remains to be seen whether he would turn down such lucrative offers to join Bayern as a backup. Other goalkeepers on Bayern's shortlist include Porto's Diogo Costa and Valencia's Giorgi Mamardashvili, who have both been monitored by Premier League clubs in the past year."
When does the Saudi Pro League transfer window close?,"Aug 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/when-does-saudi-pro-league-transfer-window-close,"Jurgen Klopp is never shy in expressing his vehement distaste for numerous aspects of modern football's calendar. Whether it's Saturday lunchtime kick-offs or England's festive fixture list, the Liverpool manager is quick to voice his criticism. The latest scheduling conflict to irk Klopp has been the closing date of the Saudi Pro League's summer transfer window. ""I think pretty much the worst thing is that the transfer window in Saudi Arabia is three weeks longer open,"" Klopp argued ahead of the new Premier League season. ""That's not helpful. So there must be, UEFA, FIFA must find solutions for that."" Klopp knows the power that the Pro League wields better than most after watching two of his starting midfielders Jordan Henderson and Fabinho move to the Middle East this summer. Here's exactly when the Saudi Pro League transfer window closes and how it compares to its European counterparts. Much like most European divisions and northern hemisphere leagues in general, the Saudi Pro League transfer window began on 1 July. Before the window had even officially opened, Saudi clubs had begun to reshape the transfer market with the earth-shattering arrival of Karim Benzema at top-flight champions Al Ittihad. While Cristiano Ronaldo's move to Al Nassr last December was ground-breaking, the acquisition of the reigning Ballon d'Or winner was a statement move. There is still plenty of time for many more. The Saudi Arabian sports ministry has put aside around $800m (Â£628m) for transfers to the top flight this summer, per the New York Times. The newly expanded 18-team league has until 20 September to splurge this hulking mass of capital. According to the detailed report in the New York Times, Saudi clubs were each provided with numerous transfer recommendations at the start of the window alongside a set of ground rules to prevent inter-league competition for players. During the seismic off-season, Saudi clubs have spent around Â£350m to recruit the likes of Benzema, former Manchester City winger Riyad Mahrez and Sadio Mane from Bayern Munich. No team among Europe's supposed elite has proven capable of matching the financial might from the Middle East. The Saudi Pro League's chief operating officer Carlo Nohra explained to Reuters: ""We had to improve quality and in order to improve quality, you have to bring in the best. Spending was always going to be an essential component for us to do this."" manual Klopp's outburst was underpinned by the disparity between the closing dates of the transfer windows in England and Saudi Arabia. While the Pro League can continue to tempt players away with lucrative deals until the fourth week of September, the Premier League's transfer window slams (it never closes quietly) shut on 1 September at 23:00 BST. When both windows are open, Premier League clubs can at least source replacements for the individuals that chased gold to the Gulf. Yet, there are 19 long days for Saudi sides to pilfer England's helpless top flight. According to FIFA's Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players, transfer windows are determined by each association. World football's governing body stipulates that there must be two registration periods (summer and winter windows) and the first ""shall begin on the first day of the season. This period may not exceed 12 weeks."" The 2023/24 season begins on 1 July 2023 for most leagues which run from autumn to spring. Therefore, the latest that the summer window could close would be on 23 September 2023. The Saudi Pro League have simply stretched the window to its limits while the Premier League plays by the same rules as the rest of Europe. League Closing date / time (BST) La Liga 01/09/2023 - 23:00 Serie A 01/09/2023 - 19:00 Bundesliga 01/09/2023 - 17:00 Ligue 1 01/09/2023 - 22:00 This year, all of the major European leagues will also close at varying times on 1 September. The Premier League voted to close their summer window in 2018 and 2019 when the season's fixtures began during August, theoretically providing every manager with a settled squad for each match in the first half of the campaign. However, the rest of Europe didn't follow suit, giving those on the continent ample opportunity to poach Premier League stars without any chance of retaliation. After two years, Premier League clubs voted to get back ""in sync"" with the rest of Europe. Now, the continent's elite teams are out of step with the Saudi Pro League - which has already spent more on transfers than La Liga. Whether this will lead to an extension of future summer windows remains to be seen. But there will be no solution for a grumpy Klopp this year."
Virgil van Dijk responds to criticism of Liverpool's transfer business,"Aug 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/virgil-van-dijk-responds-criticism-liverpool-transfer-business,"Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk has admitted that he understands why fans have ""doubts"" over the club's transfer business this summer.  The Reds made two early splashes in the transfer market this summer by signing Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai for a combined Â£95m, which could grow to Â£115m with the former's add-ons. Liverpool have largely struggled to get any other deals over the line however, seeing three bids rejected by Southampton for Romeo Lavia and interest in defensive options such as Jurrien Timber fizzle out - with the defender instead joining Arsenal.  Coupled with that, the Reds have also let a huge number of first-team players leave the club, particularly in midfielder as captain Jordan Henderson and vice-captain Fabinho both joined Saudi Pro League teams, and the likes of James Milner, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all left as free agents. Long-serving forward Roberto Firmino has also moved on. feed All of this has ultimately led to Liverpool fans being rather unimpressed with the club's transfer business and new club captain Van Dijk admitted that he understands their concerns. ""I can definitely understand it in some ways but I'm not a very negative person,"" he said. ""Obviously, when a lot of players are leaving, when your captain and vice-captain is leaving, and at the moment, there are only two incomings. And the way we have been playing, in possession really good but defensively when you concede goals it's not as good, I can understand some people having doubts. ""Let's see if more players are coming in and then we have to be ready again for a long season. It will be very tough if we look at the teams around us, but we want to be up there again, we want to be challenging again.  ""We have to be confident, we should be confident, and we should still be learning each and every day. There have been characters leaving, players who have played a big part in the success, but others have to step up. That's a nice challenge in my opinion. We should be excited."" The Reds kick-off their 2023/24 Premier League campaign on Sunday against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. "
Arsenal reject Â£30m Monaco bid for Folarin Balogun,"Aug 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-reject-30m-monaco-bid-folarin-balogun,"Arsenal have rejected a Â£30m bid from Ligue 1 side Monaco for Folarin Balogun, sources have confirmed to 90min. Balogun returned to the Gunners during the summer after a successful loan spell with Reims in which the forward managed a stunning 21 goals in Ligue 1 for the mid-table team. Despite expectations being high among Gunners fans upon his return to the Emirates, the striker barely featured during a pre-season riddled with injury concerns. Even without a dismal pre-season with Arsenal, Balogun has long been expected to leave the club once again this summer but this time permanently - the player himself stated in June that he ""definitely"" would not go out on loan again. The USMNT international has also consistently rejected the opportunity to enter talks over a new contract at the Emirates Stadium due to the lack of guarantees of game time.  90min reported in July that this resistance to signing a new deal, and unwillingness to go out on loan, has led to Arsenal slapping a Â£50m price tag on the striker. feed Crystal Palace, West Ham United, Brentford, Fulham and UEFA Champions League finalists Inter have all been in contact regarding the player's services, but sources have now confirmed to 90min that Monaco are the first to table an offer.  The Ligue 1 club have made an opening bid of Â£30m which has been swiftly reject by the Gunners, who are holding firm on their Â£50m price tag.  Monaco have stepped up their efforts to sign a new striker following Breel Embolo's ACL injury during a pre-season game. The ailment will see the Swiss forward miss the bulk of the 2023/24 campaign, making the signing of a new starting calibre striker a priority for the principality club.  Along with Balogun, 90min understands that Gift Orban of Gent and reported Chelsea and West Ham target Elye Wahi have also been shortlisted by Monaco. Both forwards have recently held talks with representatives of Tottenham Hotspur."
Xavi responds to rumours linking Neymar with Barcelona return,"Aug 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/xavi-rumours-neymar-barcelona-return,"Barcelona manager Xavi has responded to rumours linking Neymar with a sensational return to Catalonia this summer.  The Brazilian superstar has been heavily linked with a move away from current club Paris Saint-Germain, with 90min recently revealing that the Ligue 1 giants are working hard to try and move the forward on.  Signed for a world record fee of Â£190m (â¬222m) back in 2017, Neymar has largely disappointed during his time in Ligue 1 due to a myriad of injury concerns. The 31-year-old has never played more than 22 league games in any given season during his six year spell in Paris, and has failed to win the club their first ever UEFA Champions League - being on the losing end in the 2020 final.  Neymar enjoyed a much more successful stint at Barca between 2013 and 2017, winning the Champions League and two La Liga titles as an integral member of the famed 'MSN' frontline.  In light of PSG's interest in selling the player, Neymar has inevitably been linked with a return to his former club Barcelona. 90min understands that club president Joan Laporta is keen to re-sign Neymar, however manager Xavi would prefer if the club targeted Manchester City star Bernardo Silva.  feed Speaking to the press after Barcelona's 4-2 win over Tottenham Hotspur in the Joan Gamper Trophy on Tuesday evening, Xavi was asked about the links with Neymar, saying: ""I cannot say anything more about Neymar. Last year I had mentioned a name of a player from another team and that club got angry. From here until the end of the market, we will see."" Xavi also commented on the need for Barca to bulk their squad further this summer, telling reporters: ""We have to strengthen ourselves well. The sports area and the president know this reality. I'm happy with how our players are training and our pre-season."" Barcelona are likely to face stiff competition from PIF owned Saudi Pro League clubs and potentially Newcastle United, depending on the future direction the club's owners in regards to transfer policy."
West Ham agree Â£30m deal with Southampton for James Ward-Prowse,"Aug 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-agree-30m-deal-southampton-james-ward-prowse,"West Ham United have agreed a Â£30m deal with Southampton for their captain James Ward-Prowse, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Hammers have been desperately trying to strengthen their squad after selling Declan Rice to Arsenal in a British-record Â£105m transfer. Things have been slow moving for West Ham, amid internal conflicts between manager David Moyes and new technical director Tim Steidten, but progress has been made over the past 48 hours on a number of targets. Edson Alvarez has completed a medical in London ahead of a Â£34m move from Ajax, while West Ham have also agreed a Â£30m fee for former Manchester United skipper Harry Maguire - he is now due to discuss personal terms over a move to the East End. And sources have confirmed to 90min that after lengthy negotiations, West Ham have agreed a Â£30m deal with Southampton for Ward-Prowse, with an additional sell-on clause, having seen a bid for the same amount rejected by United for Scott McTominay. feed It had looked as though West Ham's move for central midfielder Ward-Prowse would fall through, with Southampton wanting more money for the 28-year-old, but terms have now been agreed between the two parties ahead of the opening weekend of the Premier League season. It's expected he will sign a four-year contract should he come through a medical unscathed. Ward-Prowse has been at Southampton for the entirety of his career, making 422 appearances on the south coast and scoring 55 goals. He has also provided 55 assists in that time, while his unerring accuracy from free-kicks has drawn comparisons to David Beckham. West Ham hope to complete deals for half a dozen players before the summer window closes, with attention now set to turn to strengthening in the wide forward areas and with a striker."
Arsenal confirm sale of Matt Turner to Nottingham Forest,"Aug 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-confirm-sale-matt-turner-nottingham-forest,"Arsenal have announced that goalkeeper Matt Turner has joined Nottingham Forest on a permanent transfer. The USMNT star only signed for Gunners last summer from MLS side New England Revolution, but his desire to play more regularly has seen him depart the Emirates Stadium after one season. With Arsenal agreeing a Â£30m deal to sign David Raya from Brentford, Turner has now completed a move to the City Ground, signing a four year deal with Nottingham Forest. In a statement, Arsenal sporting director Edu said: ""On behalf of everyone at the club, we would like to thank Matt for his contribution to Arsenal and wish him and his family all the best in their new chapter. ""Matt is an international goalkeeper with the United States and is at a stage of his career when he needs to be playing regularly. He is leaving with our best wishes to join Nottingham Forest."" feed In their unveiling at Nottingham Forest, Turner said: ""It feels great to be here. It's something I'm really looking forward to, it's a great challenge and a great step in my career. ""When I heard that there was interest to bring me here, it just felt right for my family, it felt right when my agent spoke to me about it and it feels like the right move for me right now. ""The manager and the backroom staff, everything about the club has a little sparkle to it. It's felt right from the start and Iâm happy it's got done. ""I'm looking forward to making a connection with my teammates, the fans and the city. I'm grateful to be here and can't wait to get things started."""
Moises Caicedo: CEO reveals why Brighton 'understand' Chelsea interest,"Aug 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/moises-caicedo-ceo-why-brighton-understand-chelsea-interest,"Brighton CEO Paul Barber says the club hopes to hold onto Chelsea target Moises Caicedo and ""understands"" the current interest in the Ecuador international. Caicedo has become one of the best midfielders in the Premier League during his time at the AMEX and attracted interest from both the Blues and Arsenal during the January transfer window. The midfielder asked to leave but Brighton stood firm and have maintained their not-for-sale stance during the summer so far. The youngster is said to have skipped training recently in a bid to force through a move to Stamford Bridge and wasn't involved in Brighton's final pre-season friendly of the summer against Rayo Vallecano. 90min understands Brighton have told Caicedo they will not sell him unless their Â£100m valuation is met. Chelsea are still chasing the 21-year-old and Barber insisted the south coast side do not want him to leave this year. feed He said: ""For a young player like Moises at 21, he's probably one of the best midfield players in the world already at his age, and we've had a fantastic time working with him. And we want it to continue, we've got him under a long contract. ""We're also realistic to know there is interest in him. As a young man, that interest is inevitably going to have an impact on your thought process and unsettle you a little bit. We understand that. ""But for now, he's a Brighton player, he's under contract. We expect him to work hard, prepare for the new season and we'll see what happens as the window goes on. ""The window's got a long way to go, we'd love to keep him. He's a really important player, we'll see where we are."" Brighton lost Leandro Trossard to Arsenal in January and have also sold Alexis Mac Allister and Robert Sanchez to Liverpool and Chelsea this window respectively. However, they have responded with incoming deals for Joao Pedro, Mahmoud Dahoud, James Milner, Bart Verbruggen and Igor Julio. A club-record Â£34.5m deal has also been agreed with Ajax for Ghana forward Mohammed Kudus, though an agreement over personal terms still hasn't been reached."
West Ham reach Â£30m agreement with Man Utd for Harry Maguire,"Aug 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-reach-30m-agreement-man-utd-harry-maguire,"Manchester United have agreed to sell Harry Maguire to West Ham United for a Â£30m fee, sources have confirmed to 90min. The England international was removed from his position as club captain last month, with Bruno Fernandes taking over the role at Old Trafford. 90min revealed on Monday that West Ham had made a Â£30m bid for Maguire with his long-term future at United uncertain, but the bid was turned down at the time. Part of the reason why United knocked back this offer was the belief that the Hammers would be unable to satisfy Maguire's wage demands, but after West Ham informed the Red Devils on Wednesday their willingness to amend their contract offer to the centre-back, the two clubs have come to an agreement. Though Maguire has not been 100% convinced of leaving Man Utd this transfer window, 90min understands he is open to a move and it looks likely that he will now accept West Ham's offer. feed Should Maguire complete a move to London Stadium, United will make a Â£50m loss on the 30-year-old following his world-record move from Leicester City in 2019 which made him the most expensive defender in football history. Maguire fell out of favour under Erik ten Hag last season, with Lisandro Martinez displacing him from the starting lineup and often featuring alongside Raphael Varane. Victor Lindelof has also usurped Maguire in the pecking order, with Luke Shaw also preferred in a central role at times. West Ham remain interested in Man Utd midfielder Scott McTominay, who was also the subject of a Â£30m bid this week, but the Red Devils are continuing to hold out for a higher fee for the Scotland international. Ajax's Edson Alvarez is close to finalising a move to east London, - he's undergone a medical and is set to pen a five-year deal - while West Ham have also agreed to pay Southampton Â£30m for their captain James Ward-Prowse - a move that may prevent an improved offer being made for McTominay."
West Ham want Lucas Paqueta stay as Man City make verbal offer,"Aug 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-stance-on-lucas-paqueta-future-man-city-70m-bid,"West Ham United do not intend to sell Lucas Paqueta despite Manchester City making a verbal offer of Â£70m for the Brazilian, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 25-year-old established himself as a key player in David Moyes' side during the second half of last season, helping the club to a famous win over Fiorentina in the Europa Conference League final. But despite that success, and West Ham's subsequent qualification for the Europa League, Paqueta wasn't overly impressed with how the 2022/23 season went, with 90min exclusively revealing in June that the Brazilian has particular concerns about working under Moyes. Paqueta has had to adapt his style of play to fit into Moyes' system, and although his performance levels significantly improved after the winter World Cup in Qatar, it's clear that the Brazilian's natural instincts are compromised by West Ham sitting deep and looking to hit teams on the counter. The former AC Milan and Lyon midfielder parted company with his long-term agents earlier this summer, and it's understood his new representation have been assessing potential landing spots for Paqueta during the current transfer window.  Paris Saint-Germain showed interest in Paqueta earlier this summer and retain an interest in his services, while the recently appointed director of the Saudi Pro League, Michael Emenalo, is keeping apprised of the midfielder's situation at West Ham. 90min has also learned of significant interest from Premier League champions Manchester City, who have made a verbal offer of Â£70m for Paqueta. West Ham have turned that bid down and have insisted that they do not intend to sell Paqueta, however sources have told 90min that an offer 'too good to turn down' would be considered. feed Whether or not City return for Paqueta remains to be seen, but they certainly have the financial capability to offer West Ham an increased figure - the money at their disposal evidenced by their Â£90m bid for Declan Rice earlier this summer. It's also rare for City to engage in talks unless they have a genuine belief of signing a player. City's interest stems from their desire to replace Ilkay Gundogan and Riyad Mahrez, who have left for Barcelona and Al Ahli respectively, but isn't believed to be connected to a potential sale of Bernardo Silva. 90min recently revealed that Barcelona have made fresh contact with Silva in an attempt to prise the Portuguese international away from City, but they have no intention to sell at this point. Paris Saint-Germain are also interested in the 28-year-old. 90min further understands that Newcastle's long-term interest in Paqueta has not waned, but a deal may be difficult for them to do because of Financial Fair Play regulations. A loan with obligation to buy  appears to be the only way the Magpies could facilitate a move this summer, though that is unlikely to happen at this stage."

Tottenham exploring new striker options despite Harry Kane stance,"Aug 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-new-striker-options-harry-kane,"Tottenham Hotspur are exploring opportunities to sign a new forward despite their insistence that Harry Kane will not be sold this summer, sources have confirmed to 90min. Bayern Munich have had three bids for Kane knocked back by Spurs already this transfer window and are preparing a fourth worth Â£94.6m (â¬110m). However, 90min understands that Tottenham have showed no indication that this will be enough to convince them to sell their star striker, who has less than a year left to run on his contract. 90min revealed on Tuesday that Kane would like his future sorted before the start of the new Premier League campaign - if he is still at Tottenham by the time they face Brentford on Sunday, he is happy to stay put for the entirety of 2023/24. Tottenham remain hopeful they can convince Kane to commit his long-term future to the club and he has been impressed by new head coach Ange Postecoglou following his appointment in June. Though Spurs are adamant that Kane will not be allowed to leave, they have brought in a new centre forward in Argentina youth international Alejo Veliz this week and could yet sign another this summer. feed Sources have told 90min that representatives of Spurs have sounded out several other strikers regarding potential moves to north London. 21-year-old Gent forward Gift Orban, who has scored a staggering 22 goals in 24 games since joining the Belgian club last year, is one target that Tottenham have spoken to. Chelsea target Elye Wahi of Montpellier and Lille star Jonathan David are also on Spurs' radar, as is wantaway Fulham talisman Aleksandar Mitrovic, who saw a proposed move to Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal fall through earlier this summer. Mitrovic was keen on a move to Saudi Arabia but Al Hilal failed to stump up more than Â£30m, with Fulham demanding closer to Â£50m for the Serbia international. Beyond Kane and Veliz, Brazil's starting number nine Richarlison is also on Tottenham's books and has enjoyed a fruitful pre-season under Postecoglou."
Man City confident star duo will sign new contracts,"Aug 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-city-confident-star-duo-will-sign-new-contracts,"Manchester City believe they have convinced both Bernardo Silva and Kyle Walker to stay at the club and sign new contracts, sources have confirmed to 90min. Both players have been considering their futures this summer and had been looking to leave the treble-winners during the transfer window. However, after allowing Riyad Mahrez to join Ilkay Gundogan out the exit door, Man City boss Pep Guardiola and the club's hierarchy have been firm with their stance that Silva and Walker must not be sold as well. 90min revealed earlier this summer that Walker, like Mahrez, was left furious at missing out on the Champions League final and had been looking at his options to leave. A move to former club Sheffield United failed to materialise as their takeover faltered, but the most serious interest emerged from Bayern Munich. Thomas Tuchel has pushed hard to land Walker and they offered the England defender a substantial offer to make the move, but 90min understands that Guardiola has persuaded the 33-year-old to extend his stay with the club. Walker's current deal is due to expire at the end of the 2023/24 season but this will be extended to 2025 with new terms. And the news continues to be positive at Man City as their similarly firm stance on Silva looks set to pay off. feed Silva has been looking to leave the club and there have been no shortage of suitors, with Barcelona pushing hard to sign a player who had long been eyeing a move to Catalonia. PSG were ready to pay Man City their asking price of around Â£80m this summer, but Silva has been told he will not be allowed to leave. While Silva is keen to move on from Man City and has recently reiterated that desire to Guardiola, sources have told 90min that he is accepting there is little chance of any club being able to persuade them to sell. Silva's current deal runs to 2025, which means Man City are not under pressure to sanction a transfer, and because of that a new contract is now close to being finalised. As 90min previously revealed, Man City are willing to make Silva one of the best-paid players at the club and in the Premier League altogether, putting him close to the wage packets of teammates Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne. Man City believe and hope that both Silva and Walker will put pen-to-paper on their new deals by the end of this month."
Barcelona provide update on Ousmane Dembele's proposed PSG move,"Aug 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-update-ousmane-dembele-proposed-psg-move,"Barcelona vice-president Rafa Yuste has confirmed that Ousmane Dembele is on the verge of completing a move to Paris Saint-Germain. The France international was not expected to leave or push for a move away from Catalonia this summer, but PSG triggered his â¬50m (Â£43m) release clause shortly before it expired in July and proceeded to discuss personal terms. During these negotiations, Dembele was called out in public by Barcelona head coach Xavi and club captain Sergi Roberto, who expressed their shock at the sudden move. 90min reported on August 3 that PSG had hoped to wrap up a deal before the end of last week, but a deal has dragged on and reports from the Spanish press suggested talks had stalled. feed But after Dembele was omitted from Barca's squad to take on Tottenham Hotspur in the annual Joan Gamper Trophy on Tuesday night, vice-president Yuste insisted that the transfer will go ahead and confirmation of an agreement is close. ""We're on the verge of resolving Dembele deal with Paris Saint-Germain as all parties want to seal it as soon as possible,"" Yuste said. ""Dembele is not with us tonight as we hope to settle the matter soon. We are on it.""

Chelsea send summer signing to Strasbourg on loan,"Aug 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-send-summer-signing-strasbourg-loan,"Chelsea have confirmed that winger Angelo Gabriel has joined French outfit Strasbourg on loan for the 2023/24 season. The 18-year-old signed from Santos in his native Brazil back in July for a fee believed to be in the region of Â£13m. Gabriel featured three times during Chelsea's five-match tour of the United States in pre-season but has now completed a move to Ligue 1. Strasbourg, who are managed by Patrick Vieira, were recently acquired by Chelsea's BlueCo ownership group, with other young summer signings expected to be sent on loan to the Stade de la Meinau before the end of the transfer window. feed 90min understands that Chelsea are working on a deal to sign Gabriel's former Santos teammate, Deivid Washington, and it is possible they reunite at Strasbourg. Chelsea confirmed an extended rejigging of squad numbers prior to confirmation of Gabriel's loan, with the winger not handed one ahead of the new season and suggesting a move away was close to being finalised.

Barcelona unconcerned by Ilkay Gundogan registration clause,"Aug 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-unconcerned-ilkay-gundogan-registration-clause,"Barcelona are not concerned about losing midfielder Ilkay Gundogan over a registration clause in his contract, 90min understands. Gundogan joined on a free transfer from Manchester City this summer, inking a two-year contract which also includes an option for the midfielder to terminate his deal if he is not registered in Barcelona's squad by the time the new La Liga season kicks off this weekend. Financial restrictions mean Barcelona have not yet registered any of their new singings - Gundogan, Oriol Romeu, Inigo Martinez - as well as any new contracts agreed this summer and the return of loanees like Ez Abde and Fermin Lopez.  As it stands, manager Xavi has just 13 eligible players for the season-opener against Getafe on 13 August, including Ousmane Dembele and Franck Kessie, who are on the cusp of leaving the club. The imminent sales of Dembele and Kessie, to Paris Saint-Germain and Al Ahli respectively, are expected to net Barcelona around â¬65m (Â£56m), while talks are also on over a 16% sale of Barca Studios which would provide another cash injection. feed Sources have confirmed to 90min that Barcelona are confident they will wrap up their outstanding deals in time to register Gundogan and the rest of their new signings before the new season gets underway. As was the case with Gavi earlier this summer when the midfielder's contract extension was delayed, Gundogan is not causing problems behind the scene and is not contemplating an early exit from Camp Nou. While Barcelona understand their current situation, sources close to the club insist they are confident they have the financial capacity to register all their new signings - a stance exemplified by ongoing efforts to sign Manchester City duo Bernardo Silva and Joao Cancelo. Gundogan and the rest of Barcelona's new signings can be registered up to and including the day of the Getafe game, and club officials are optimistic everything will be finalised in time."
Arsenal reach agreement to sign David Raya from Brentford,"Aug 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-reach-agreement-david-raya-brentford,"Arsenal have agreed a fee with Brentford for the transfer of goalkeeper David Raya, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Spain international has been looking to leave the Bees this summer after turning down various offers of a new contract. His current deal expires in 2024. Brentford have been willing to facilitate a sale but their initial Â£40m asking price put off various suitors. Tottenham Hotspur agreed personal terms with Raya but backed away from a deal due to this valuation, while Bayern Munich also dropped their interest for similar reasons. 90min understands Arsenal's opening offer of Â£20m plus a further Â£5m in add-ons was knocked back by the Bees, but they have now succeeded with a new bid which is believed to be worth Â£30m in total. Raya has been determined to secure a move to the Emirates Stadium and he is expected to undergo a medical shortly. feed The Gunners have long-admired Raya and tried to sign him back in 2020, but were unable to get a deal over the line. Arsenal goalkeeper coach Inaki Cana worked with the Spaniard during his brief spell at Brentford. Raya will provide competition for England international Aaron Ramsdale though is not expected to be the immediate first-choice goalkeeper at Arsenal. Since Brentford were promoted from the Championship in 2021, Raya has proven to be one of the Premier League's leading goalkeepers due to his shot-stopping and ability to play from the back. Brentford will head into the new season with Netherlands international Mark Flekken as their starting goalkeeper following his summer arrival from Freiburg"
Tottenham announce Â£13m signing of Argentina youth international,"Aug 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-announce-13m-signing-argentina-youth-international,"Tottenham Hotspur have confirmed the signing of Alejo Veliz from Rosario Central, subject to international clearance and a work permit. The 19-year-old has put pen to paper on a contract until 2029 and becomes Spurs' seventh permanent addition of a busy summer transfer window. The club announced the arrival of Micky van de Ven from Wolfsburg earlier on Tuesday. ""It's like I'm touching the heavens,"" Veliz said during his announcement video. feed Veliz will take the number 36 shirt and joins Tottenham for a Â£13m fee. 90min reported last week that Spurs were going to win the race for the highly-rated striker, with AC Milan, AS Roma, Nottingham Forest, and Salernitana also interested in his signature. While Veliz arrives to bolster Spurs' attacking options, his arrival is unlikely to have much bearing on the future of Harry Kane. 90min understands that Kane will stay put in north London for the 2023/24 season if a move away does not transpire before the new Premier League campaign begins this weekend. Bayern Munich have had three Kane bids rejected by Tottenham and are contemplating making a fourth, while the German champions are also beginning to look at alternate options."
Steven Gerrard reveals stance on Saudi Arabia interest in Mohamed Salah ,"Aug 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/steven-gerrard-stance-saudi-arabia-interest-mohamed-salah,"Liverpool legend and Al Ettifaq manager Steven Gerrard has admitted he does not want to see Mohamed Salah follow him to Saudi Arabia. The Reds have already lost two key players to Saudi Arabia this summer, with Fabinho joining Al Ittihad and captain Jordan Henderson linking back up with Gerrard at Al Ettifaq, and Saudi officials are understood to be keen to sign Salah. Fortunately for Liverpool fans, Salah's agent has already publicly shot down the rumours, insisting the Egyptian does not want to leave Anfield this summer. That stance will have gone down well with Gerrard, who recently confessed that he would rather see Salah fire Liverpool to more success before making a move to the Middle East. feed Asked by Sada Al Malaâeb if he would want to sign Salah, Gerrard responded: ""No! No, no - the answer is no, because Mohamed Salah is my favourite player, I love Liverpool Football Club, so Mohamed can stay where he is. ""When he wins more leagues and more Champions Leagues with Liverpool, we'll maybe consider it."" Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp recently urged FIFA to look at reducing the length of the Saudi transfer window, which runs until 20 September - 19 days after the European window slams shut. ""The influence of Saudi Arabia is massive at the moment,"" Klopp said. ""Pretty much the worst thing is that the transfer window in Saudi Arabia is open three weeks longer. If I am right, I heard something like that, then at least in Europe thatâs not helpful. ""UEFA or FIFA must find solutions for that. Itâs already influential for us but we will have to learn to deal with it."""
Harry Kane sets Bayern Munich transfer deadline as new Premier League season nears,"Aug 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/harry-kane-bayern-munich-transfer-deadline-new-premier-league-season-nears,"Harry Kane has informed Tottenham that he will not look to leave the club once the new Premier League season gets underway, 90min understands. Kane has entered the final year of his Spurs contract and has been pursued heavily by Bayern Munich, who have seen three bids knocked back for the England striker, the last of which was a club-record offer worth â¬100m (Â£86m). Bayern had stressed that their third offer would be their last but are understood to be considering a fourth approach for Kane. While the German giants explore their options, sources have confirmed to 90min that Kane has made it clear he will not consider a move away from Spurs once the new season gets underway this weekend. Spurs are due to travel across London to face Brentford on 13 August and, if he is still at the club on that date, then Kane plans to remain for at least the whole campaign. feed That message has been conveyed to Bayern, who now have less than week to make a decision over a fourth bid. Spurs chairman Daniel Levy has not yet given a firm asking price and remains determined to not only keep Kane at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, but also to convince the 30-year-old to put pen to paper on a new contract. Bayern's hierarchy are understood to be divided on their next move. While some are encouraging an improved bid, others believe they are fighting a losing battle and are keen to start looking elsewhere. Scouts have drawn up reports on alternative targets, with the likes of Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic and Eintracht Frankfurt's Randal Kolo Muani on Bayern's radar."
Micky van de Ven joins Tottenham from Wolfsburg,"Aug 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/micky-van-de-ven-joins-tottenham-from-wolfsburg,"Tottenham Hotspur have announced the arrival of centre-back Micky van de Ven from Bundesliga side Wolfsburg â the transfer remains subject to obtaining a work permit. As 90min reported earlier this month, Spurs agreed a Â£43m deal with Wolfsburg for Van de Ven. He has now signed a six-year contract at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium until 2029. Van de Ven has already been assigned the number 37 shirt most recently worn by Kyle Walker-Peters and previously owned by Harry Kane in his earliest days with the first-team.

""The way the manager plays football is really attractive and I feel like it suits me as a player. And with how well the team did last season, the trajectory that we're on now, I'm just looking forward to being a part of that. ""And to be able to learn from Kieran Trippier is another big thing for me; hopefully he teaches me how to become a better player and a better full-back."" feed Manager Eddie Howe added: ""Tino is a very talented young player with an exciting future ahead of him so we are delighted to sign him. ""At 20, he already has lots of attributes that I admire but he also has the potential and drive to really grow with this team. I'm looking forward to working with him and to seeing him develop in a Newcastle shirt."" Livramento will now compete for minutes at right-back with 32-year-old Trippier but is also comfortable further forward up the field."

The 31-year-old's father, Neymar Da Silva Santos, was quick to deny reports from French daily L'Equipe which stated that the Brazilian had told PSG that he wants to leave the club. ""I can't confirm a news that didn't happen. L'Equipe being L'Efake, this came from somewhere, let's try to understand the intention,"" the senior Neymar told PL Brasil. Sources have told 90min that while Neymar is unsettled, it is PSG who are working hard to try and move him on. A return to Barcelona has been mooted but, although president Joan Laporta is believed to be keen, manager Xavi is not believed to be looking at Neymar as a realistic target - instead preferring they focus on Manchester City's Bernardo Silva. Chelsea have also been linked, with club owner Todd Boehly a confirmed fan, but the Blues have not yet indicated any desire to make a move for Neymar this summer despite being contacted by those working on the deal. Contact has also been made with representatives of the Saudi Pro League and the Public Investment Fund (PIF), who also own Newcastle. PIF would love to lure Neymar to St James' Park but would also consider recruiting the 31-year-old for one of their Saudi outfits: Al Ittihad, Al Nassr, Al Ahli or Al Hilal. feed PSG are currently locked in talks with PIF over the potential sale of midfielder Marco Verratti, but they are struggling to agree a fee as they demand nearly double the initial â¬30m (Â£26m) offer that has come in. It was during these conversations that Neymar's name was first mentioned. 90min understands that Verratti remains unhappy with the treatment of both Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, who has been put up for sale and banished from first-team training after refusing to extend his contract. Verratti has made those concerns known to the club's hierarchy. New manager Luis Enrique is keen to keep the Italian but is believed to be open to parting ways with Neymar this summer. PSG are already working hard on new signings for Enrique and have bolstered in attack with the signing of Goncalo Ramos, who has joined on an initial loan from Benfica which comes with an option for a permanent â¬80m (Â£69m) move to the French capital next summer. Eintracht Frankfurt's Randal Kolo Muani is also a key target and personal terms have been agreed with the 24-year-old."

PSG confirm Goncalo Ramos loan signing with buy option,"Aug 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-confirm-goncalo-ramos-loan-signing-buy-option,"Paris Saint-Germain have completed the signing of Benfica and Portugal striker Goncalo Ramos. The 22-year-old forward, who scored a hat-trick against Switzerland in the last 16 of the 2022 World Cup, joins on loan until the end of the season when PSG will have the option to make it a permanent deal. Benfica had hoped for a fee in the region of Â£69m for Ramos, who previously attracted interest from Manchester United.

Man Utd reject West Ham offers for Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay,"Aug 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-reject-west-ham-offers-harry-maguire-scott-mctominay,"Manchester United have rejected Â£30m offers from West Ham for Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay, sources have confirmed to 90min. West Ham saw an opening offer for former captain Maguire worth Â£20m rebuffed last month before a more recent second proposal of Â£30m was also dismissed by United. The Hammers also firmed up their interest in another United star in the shape of Scottish midfielder McTominay but, like with Maguire, the Red Devils were not willing to do business at the Â£30m mark. 90min understands the actual offers were not too far away from United's valuation, but the overall deals including the wages West Ham could afford or were willing to provide were not sufficient enough to tempt the Old Trafford giants into selling either player. United, who themselves have spent more than Â£100m this summer on Andre Onana, Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund, are anxious to move players on to finance other deals and Erik ten Hag has sanctioned the departures of both Maguire and McTominay.  However, neither player is desperate to move. feed Maguire remains unconvinced that his future is best served away from the club despite having the captaincy stripped, while McTominay also believes he could yet play his way into Ten Hag's plans given fellow midfielders Donny van de Beek and Fred are expected to move this summer.  West Ham - who are the only team to make firm offers for either Maguire or McTominay this summer - are now considering improved bids for the two players. They are also looking to complete the signing of Ajax midfielder Edson Alvarez in the coming days."

The Gunners recruited the Italy international back in January and he has since courted maintained interest from Serie A sides Lazio and Juventus. While a good offer would be enough for Arsenal to sell Jorginho - much like teammate Thomas Partey's current situation - 90min understands he isn't in talks with Turkish side Fenerbahce and an exit is not currently on the cards. Arsenal are preparing to let goalkeeper Matt Turner depart after agreeing an Â£8m deal with Nottingham Forest for the USMNT international. Turner joined Arsenal in 2022 as back-up to Aaron Ramsdale and featured at the 2022 World Cup with the United States. Forest used Dean Henderson and Keylor Navas as goalies last season. Steve Cooper's side still like Manchester United's Henderson, but their preference for a loan deal due to his injury record differs to United favouring a permanent move. Roma defender Roger Ibanez was also a target for Forest, with talks over a â¬30m deal being held, but he has instead elected to join Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli. Napoli midfielder Piotr Zielinski is another player who will soon seal a move to the Middle East. Poland international Zielinski, who was a key figure in his side's historic Serie A title win last season, will soon confirm his move to Al Ahli, where Roberto Firmino, Allan Saint-Maximin and Edouard Mendy have all relocated this summer. Napoli are targeting Teun Koopmeiners and Gabri Veiga as potential replacements. Atalanta aren't looking to sell Koopmeiners for any less than â¬50m, while a â¬30m offer for Veiga was rejected by Celta Vigo. Paris Saint-Germain have agreed personal terms with Eintracht Frankfurt striker Randal Kolo Muani and a deal is close to completion. PSG see Kolo Muani as their ideal replacement for Kylian Mbappe and talks accelerated over the weekend. Youngster Hugo Ekitike was offered during negotiations, a player Frankfurt are appreciative of.

The Portugal forward also has an offer from Al Ahli but wants to stay in Europe. feed Burnley are ready to seize on Sheffield United's instability by pursuing a deal for Norwegian midfielder Sander Berge. The Blades have already lost Iliman Ndiaye this month and are ready to sell their other star midfielder to the Clarets. Berge only has a year left on his contract and has turned down fresh advances from United. Should a deal be agreed, Berge will still need to come through a medical, having seen a switch to Fulham in January fall through because of a knock. Burnley are also keen to wrap up a deal for Ajax striker Mohamed Daramy but face competition from Reims, who have entered the bidding late on in their search for a replacement for Folarin Balogun. Crystal Palace are in talks with Bayer Leverkusen over a loan move for centre-back Odilon Kossounou.

Adams played for the USMNT at the 2022 World Cup and was relegated with Leeds in his first season in the Premier League having joined from RB Leipzig for Â£15m. Adams suffered a hamstring injury in March and didn't add to his 24 league appearances thereafter. Leeds accepted they would likely lose Adams and international teammate Brenden Aaronson following their relegation to the Championship. Aaronson has since joined Union Berlin on loan, while Adams previously attracted interest from Newcastle. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea have now enquired over his availability. Adams has a release worth around Â£25m and the Blues believe the midfielder would slot in well in west London. Leeds expect the 24-year-old to leave Elland Road by the end of the month, with Chelsea not the only Premier League side interested. Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester United, Brighton and Brentford are all keeping tabs on the situation. feed Adams was in attendance for Leeds' opening Championship game of the season against Cardiff on Sunday as his side rescued a 2-2 draw thanks to goals from Liam Cooper and Crysencio Summerville. Chelsea have signed exciting talent like Nicolas Jackson and Christopher Nkunku so far this window but are light in midfield after the departures of Mason Mount, N'Golo Kante and Ruben Loftus-Cheek. Rennes star Lesley Ugochukwu has recently joined the options at Mauricio Pochettino's disposal which include Enzo Fernandez, Conor Gallagher and Andrey Santos. Moises Caicedo is a high-profile target for Pochettino and Todd Boehly but no agreement with Brighton has been reached.

The 19-year-old has been attracting the interest of Chelsea and Arsenal for the best part of a year, but Liverpool have shot to the front of the queue of interested parties after allowing central midfield duo Jordan Henderson and Fabinho to head to the riches of Saudi Arabia. The Reds saw an opening offer of Â£35m immediately rejected by recently-relegated Southampton, before an improved bid for Lavia worth Â£42m was also rebuffed. Southampton have maintained throughout negotiations that they want at least Â£50m for Lavia, and 90min understands they have held their ground after receiving a third Liverpool offer, worth Â£45m in total. Liverpool remain keen to tie up a deal for Lavia and crucially have not walked away from negotiations - indicating that they may be willing to raise their offer once more in order to get a deal over the line. feed Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai have already arrived at Anfield this summer, from Brighton and RB Leipzig respectively, but there's an appetite for Liverpool to conclude further business in a bid to get back into the Premier League title mix. Jurgen Klopp has seen not only Henderson and Fabinho depart, but also Naby Keita, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and James Milner from the midfield ranks - Lavia's potential arrival an indication of a changing of the guard on Merseyside. Fluminense's Andre Trindade is regarded as a viable alternative to Lavia, should Liverpool not be able to iron things out with Southampton, while the club may also look to sign a centre-back before the summer window slams shut."
West Ham return with Â£30m offer for Harry Maguire,"Aug 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-30m-offer-harry-maguire,"West Ham United have made a second bid for former Manchester United captain Harry Maguire, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Hammers are looking to strengthen their squad with as many as six signings before the transfer window closes, but have only signed Cliftonville youngster Sean Moore to date. The club is yet to splash any of the immediate cash received from Declan Rice's Â£105m British-record move to Arsenal. A deal for Ajax midfielder Edson Alvarez is nearing completion after a fee was agreed and West Ham have now returned with another offer for Maguire after an initial approach was knocked back at the end of July. Sources have confirmed to 90min that West Ham's new bid is worth Â£30m, though any deal, should United decide the fee is enough, is likely to hinge on the 13-time Premier League winners continuing to contribute towards Maguire's hefty wages. United manager Erik ten Hag has established Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez as his first-choice centre-back duo at Old Trafford, with Victor Lindelof and Luke Shaw, naturally a left-back, also ahead of Maguire in the pecking order for places. feed Maguire has also been stripped of the club captaincy this summer, in favour of appointing Bruno Fernandes, and United are willing to sanction his exit if they receive an offer that they believe reflects his market value - they paid Leicester Â£80m for his services in 2019. West Ham are continuing to show interest in Maguire's United team-mate Scott McTominay, sources have further confirmed to 90min. An offer of Â£30m has been made by the Hammers for the 26-year-old Scot and talks are ongoing between the two clubs over a potential deal. The Hammers have returned to McTominay after deciding against pursuing Southampton's James Ward-Prowse. However, neither Maguire nor McTominay are itching to leave Old Trafford, with both players hopeful of featuring in the new season. Monaco's Youssouf Fofana is another player front and centre of technical director Tim Steidten's transfer plans, with West Ham also wanting to sign a left-back and striker before the window closes on September 1."

Tottenham reject Bayern Munich record bid for Harry Kane,"Aug 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-reject-bayern-munich-record-bid-harry-kane,"Tottenham have turned down Bayern Munichâs club record transfer bid for Harry Kane, sources have confirmed to 90min. Bayern have been keen on landing Kane ever since Robert Lewandowski joined Barcelona last summer. They had already seen two offers rejected by Tottenham earlier this summer, but left a recent meeting between club representatives feeling optimistic about a deal being struck, before then entering their third bid worth â¬100m (Â£86m). That figure was both a record for Bayern, far exceeding what they paid for Lucas Hernandez in 2019, as well as Tottenham, who sold Gareth Bale to Real Madrid for Â£85m in 2013. Despite Bayern wanting a quick decision from Spurs, the Premier League side took their time in relaying a response. 90min understands that the answer has been given and it remains ânoâ. Bayern had made it clear that it was their best and final offer, but are currently considering whether or not to return with a fourth proposal for the England captain. feed Although optimistic at the start of August, Bayern have also started to weigh up other options once more. One alternative is Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic, who has already asked for a transfer this summer following a sub-par season in Serie A. Bayern have been in touch with his representatives, although Juventus have also been in touch with Chelsea regarding a Romelu Lukaku plus cash swap. Another striker Bayern have long kept an eye on is Randal Kolo Muani at Eintracht Frankfurt, the â¬100m (Â£86m) asking price, despite matching the offer for Kane, is not something they want to pay. Rather, Paris Saint-Germain have emerged as favourites for France international Kolo Muani. Personal terms have already been agreed following talks over the weekend, with the club expected to follow suit and agree a transfer fee between them. PSG are also willing to offer Hugo Ekitike, whose loan from Reims was made permanent in June, in part-exchange."
Edson Alvarez: Ajax midfielder undergoing medical at West Ham,"Aug 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/edson-alvarez-ajax-medical-west-ham,"Edson Alvarez is undergoing a medical at West Ham United ahead of joining from Ajax on a five-year contract. Sources have confirmed to 90min that an agreement has been reached in principle over a deal worth Â£34m, with the Mexico international one of West Ham's top targets to replace Declan Rice. The Hammers have endured a frustrating transfer window so far, amid clashes between manager David Moyes and technical director Tim Steidten over targets, and have seen bids for Joao Palhinha, Conor Gallagher and James Ward-Prowse turned down. Manchester United's Scott McTominay has also been on the radar, but Alvarez, alongside Monaco's Youssouf Fofana, is a player that Steidten has been pushing for West Ham to sign. 90min revealed on Sunday that talks were ongoing with Dutch giants Ajax over a fee for Alvarez, who has long indicated his desire to move to the Premier League, and sources have now confirmed that an agreement has been reached over a deal that could eventually be worth Â£34m. Alvarez was close to joining Borussia Dortmund earlier this summer but a deal to move to the Bundesliga runners-up fell through at the 11th hour. feed 26-year-old Alvarez has also been on the radar of Manchester United and Chelsea over the past 12 months, though both clubs have moved on to secure other targets and their interest has subsequently cooled. West Ham hope that Alvarez, who is expected to sign a long-term contract barring any last minute complications, will be the first of up to half a dozen new signings at London Stadium. The club are gearing up to compete in the Europa League after winning last season's Conference League, but haven't added to their squad yet and have seen captain Rice leave for Arsenal in a British-record Â£105m deal. Another central midfield arrival is high up on West Ham's transfer agenda, while they would also like to sign a new central defender, left back and centre forward as a minimum - the need for the latter highlighted further by the club agreeing to send Gianluca Scamacca back to Italy just 12 months into a five-year deal. Atalanta confirmed his arrival from West Ham in a deal worth Â£26m on Monday, allowing the Premier League side to recoup the majority of the money they paid Sassuolo in July 2022."
Bayern Munich draw up list of Harry Kane alternatives,"Aug 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-list-harry-kane-alternatives,"Bayern Munich have drawn up a list of alternative options to Harry Kane in case their club record bid for the striker is rejected, 90min understands.  Sources confirmed to 90min last week that Bayern Munich had made a club record Â£86m (â¬100m) bid to sign Tottenham talisman Kane this summer, having previously seen two offers rejected by Daniel Levy and co. in recent weeks.  As things stand, the Bundesliga holders are yet to receive a response from Tottenham regarding their most recent offer and have had no indication that it will be accepted.  Due to this uncertainty, Bayern officials have opted to draw up a list of alternative targets if a deal to sign Kane does not materliase.  feed 90min understands that one such alternative target is Dusan Vlahovic of Juventus. The forward asked to leave Juve in June - a request that was given its blessing by manager Massimiliano Allegri - following a disappointing 2022/23 campaign in Turin in which he managed just 10 Serie A goals.  Bayern have now made contact with Vlahovic's representatives in order to check in on the player's current situation at Juventus. 90min recently reported that Vlahovic's current employers have made attempts to get rid of the forward this summer already. The club has proposed a swap deal with Chelsea that would see the Serbian move to Stamford Bridge in exchange for Romelu Lukaku plus cash.  While Chelsea have held talks with Vlahovic's camp, they are not keen on the aforementioned deal as they are not interested in paying a fee in additiona to parting with Lukaku to get the forward.  Another striker that Bayern have shortlisted is France international and Eintracht Frankfurt star Randal Kolo Muani. The emerging talent has been linked with Bayern earlier this year, however 90min understands that Frankfurt's asking price of Â£86m is not a fee that the club would be willing to pay.  Paris Saint-Germain are currently favourite to sign Kolo Muani, with the player already agreeing personal terms after talks accelerated over the weekend. Sources have confirmed to 90min that a deal is also likely to be agreed between the clubs soon, and a significant reason for that is PSG being willing offer Hugo Ekitike in part-exchange.  Kolo Muani is seen by PSG as an ideal replacement for Kylian Mbappe in plans for life without their superstar forward due to his current contract situation and desire to join Real Madrid. "

However, with Barca's interest reigniting, 90min understands Silva has again made it clear to City and Guardiola that he would like to leave the club - the Portuguese international said the same 12 months ago but was asked to stay for another season, at which point the Premier League champions would look at letting him leave as long as their valuation of around Â£80m was met. But the departures of Riyad Mahrez and Ilkay Gundogan have seen City change their stance on Silva and now insist they can't afford to let him leave, even if a club agree to meet the valuation - something Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain have already indicated they would be willing to do. Now Barca, who are set to pocket nearly Â£60m from the sales of Ousmane Dembele and Franck Kessie, are trying to package together a deal that will convince City to let Silva go, having previously thought a deal was unattainable because of their precarious finances. feed Barca are also locked in talks with City over the future of Joao Cancelo, who has agreed personal terms, and they hope they can come to agreement that will take both Portugal internationals to Catalonia this summer - but sources have told 90min that as it stands City will not sell.

Hopefully he can stay. We have one more year of contract, it's not the end so if someone wants him they have to talk, like Bernardo Silva. We want them to stay.

There have been enquiries, although the Liverpool star has primarily always been considered a target for 2024 or beyond, rather than necessarily this year. It means the matter isn't likely to be closed. feed Salah, whose Liverpool contract still has two years left to run, has played plenty of minutes in pre-season, currently sits sixth on the Reds' all-time scoring charts and was recently tipped to climb even higher in the standings by current record holder Ian Rush. ""I speak a lot to Mo Salah,"" Rush told Prothom Alo. ""Mo keeps saying, 'why did you score so many goals?'. He is thinking he might break my record. ""He would have to be there a good few more years if he is going to break that record. He plays a bit more of a wide role now. I don't think he has scored as many goals but I think he made just as many assists this year. ""He has become more of a team player. A couple of years ago, he was maybe being a little selfish. But in the last two years, he has become more of a team player. And I think he is making just as many assists as he is scoring goals. ""Good luck to him. If he does it, he does it. I don't care as long as he is winning things. There is no point doing that if you are not winning trophies. He can have that as long as they win a trophy."""

Football becomes pointless if Tottenham cave in and sell Harry Kane,"Aug 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/football-becomes-pointless-if-tottenham-sell-harry-kane,"FROM TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR STADIUM - The second peak of Harry Kane's esteemed career coincided with Tottenham turning into a regressive and defensive team. From mid-2018 to the start of 2020, the striker became dogged by injuries, stripping him of a yard of pace and essentially pencilling him in for around ten games on the sidelines during any given season. By the time he effectively had back-to-back pre-seasons to reset his body during the pandemic, Spurs had fully committed to Jose Mourinho. Kane took on not only more of the scoring load alongside Son Heung-min, but also shouldered the creative burden. Through the Mourinho, Nuno Espirito Santo and Antonio Conte eras, Kane had to do everything in order to maintain Tottenham's attacking potency. Enter Ange Postecoglou, a head coach drafted in to restore Spurs' long-forgotten attacking principles. Kane scored Spurs' first four in a 5-1 pre-season thrashing of Shakhtar Donetsk on Sunday as they flexed their new identity back on home soil. For the first time since the days of Mauricio Pochettino, Tottenham are looking to play on the front foot, to dominate the ball, to suffocate teams with possession and chances. When Kane was substituted towards the end of the match, he was met with a standing ovation, his iconic chant sung loudly from all four corners of the ground. Just as it had after each of his four goals, just as it had before a ball had even been kicked this afternoon. Today's script may as well have been written by our new AI and ChatGPT overlords - once Kane was on the bench, a dark cloud emerged over the stadium. The heavens opened for five minutes before the sun began to reappear again. Heading into Sunday's encounter, Spurs were continuing to mull over a new bid from Bayern Munich worth Â£86m. It could well be their last in a saga which is nearing an end. If Tottenham choose to cash in on Kane, they stop any risk of him walking away for free next summer when his contract expires. It's become clear that this is a risk they must take. Kane became the club's all-time leading scorer back in February when he grabbed the only goal in a remarkable 1-0 victory at home to eventual treble-winners Manchester City. At full-time, he was celebrated and heralded for his remarkable achievements. That's when it first sunk in - Tottenham Hotspur are Harry Kane, and Harry Kane is Tottenham Hotspur. manual If under-fire chairman Daniel Levy agrees to sell the club's greatest ever player, he would tank his already negative approval rating to ungodly levels. If Kane walks for free, Spurs miss out on a hefty fee for the balance sheet, but at least he can say he kept the striker for all six years of his contract, tried his darnedest to extend that deal. It's an incredibly rare feat for an academy graduate to become the face and soul of their boyhood club, especially in the super-club age. Tottenham should cherish this as long as they possibly can, kick the replacement striker can down the road for another year at least. If building a billion-pound stadium was meant to bridge the gap to the elite in the transfer market, it should also be able to absolve such a financial loss. There is, also, the Postecoglou factor. Kane scored 30 Premier League goals last season, his joint-best total despite sorry Spurs limping to an eighth place finish. In theory, he would be able to rival Erling Haaland for the Golden Boot in a team which creates bucketloads of chances rather than being drip-fed them. ""He's a fantastic striker, one of the world's best. I think the way the team plays will help him as well. He loves scoring goals and you saw today we created a load of chances and he was the beneficiary of that,"" Postecoglou said on Sunday. Tottenham still believe they could yet convince Kane to sign a new contract. This is more of a last chance than a last dance. The cruel world of modern football needs both to go through with it."

Alvarez has emerged as one of West Ham's top targets this summer, and is the choice of recently appointed technical director Tim Steidten.

That has now seen West Ham switch focus to Alvarez after failing to seal deals for Southampton's James Ward-Prowse and Manchester United's Scott McTominay.

Brighton agree club record fee for Ajax star Mohammed Kudus,"Aug 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/brighton-agree-club-record-fee-ajax-star-mohammed-kudus,"Brighton & Hove Albion have agreed a club record transfer fee with Ajax for Ghana forward Mohammed Kudus, sources have confirmed to 90min. Brighton have been tracking Kudus all summer, as 90min has already revealed, and now they have pushed ahead and finalised the terms of a deal with Ajax.  The Seagulls have met Ajax's asking price of â¬40m (Â£34.5m) and that would surpass their existing club record move set earlier this summer when Joao Pedro completed his move from Watford.

Kudus is currently in Germany with Ajax ahead of their pre-season clash with Borussia Dortmund on Sunday afternoon, but it remains to be seen if he will feature."
Potential destinations for Folarin Balogun this summer,"Aug 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/potential-destinations-for-folarin-balogun-this-summer,"A year is an awful long time in football, and that has certainly proved the case for Folarin Balogun.  This time last year, few would have known too much about the young Arsenal striker, but following an impressive loan spell with Stade Reims in Ligue 1, the 22-year-old is now one of the most exciting young forwards in Europe and a USMNT international. Scoring 22 goals in 39 games for Reims last season, he is now being targeted by a number of top clubs. However, 90min understands that Arsenal value Balogun at Â£50m, which may put off some potential suitors. The Gunners have told Balogun he can find a new club with no obvious route into the first team as Gabriel Jesus, Eddie Nketiah and new signing Kai Havertz stand in his path. There will be many clubs knocking on his agent's door this summer, but where he will end up is still unclear. feed Having come within 90 minutes of Champions League glory last season, things promise to be more complicated for Inter this term. Andre Onana, Marcelo Brozovic, Edin Dzeko and Romelu Lukaku will not be at the club next season as Simone Inzaghi is responsible for something of a rebuild in key areas this summer. One position that needs strengthening in the window is up front. Having brought in Marcus Thuram on a free transfer to help Lautaro Martinez, Inzaghi is keen to reinforce his attacking unit further having lost two key centre-forward options. Balogun is one of the players Inter have been in contact with over a potential move to San Siro. More similar in profile to Martinez than Thuram, Balogun could offer depth and quality in attack. The forward has huge potential and could develop further in Serie A under Inzaghi's tutelage, but that Â£50m fee would likely be unworkable for Inter. Considering West Ham are the only Premier League club yet to make a signing this window, David Moyes would probably be thankful to get anybody through the door at the London Stadium. The Â£105m departure of Declan Rice means the Hammers have a huge budget to work with, but they have still been unable to get any deals done. Atalanta, who are a club linked with Balogun themselves, have agreed a deal for Irons forward Gianluca Scamacca after an unsuccessful stint with West Ham. Not only will this add another Â£26m to available funds, it will free up a space up front that needs filling. Balogun could be the man to fill the gap, posing a completely different skillset to the departing Scamacca. Balogun's pace and nous for finding space in the penalty area could make him a prime target to add more goals to a sometimes blunt West Ham side. A return to Ligue 1 could be on the cards for Balogun, who would certainly need no time in readjusting to life in France. Lille finished fifth last season and qualified for the Europa Conference League, but would likely find it difficult to raise the required funds to prise Balogun away from north London. Paulo Fonseca's side have lost a couple of forward players in Timothy Weah and Jonathan Bamba this summer and need greater depth in attacking areas. Balogun, however, may be too far out of their price range. Jordan Ayew, Odsonne Edouard and Jean-Philippe Mateta are hardly the most awe-inspiring attacking trio in the Premier League. The three strikers have all struggled for consistency since arriving at Selhurst Park, and with Wilfried Zaha's exit, Palace need more goals next year. Michael Olise's potential departure would only exacerbate this issue, but Balogun could be the solution. The 22-year-old's ability to run in behind opposition defences makes him a completely different proposition to the Eagles' current centre-forward options. Similarly to Lille, however, Palace would be unlikely to splash Â£50m on untested Premier League player, knowing a better could be found deal somewhere else in Europe. Ivan Toney scored 20 goals in 33 Premier League games last season but will not be available to Brentford until January 2024 following a ban for breaching betting rules. While Bryan Mbuemo, Kevin Schade, and Yoane Wissa are all capable of providing goals for the Bees next year, they won't be able to offer the same consistency as Toney. Balogun showcased his ability to score weekly for Reims last season, although doing it in the Premier League is admittedly a different proposition.  Balogun is also a different profile striker to Toney and is not quite as adept at holding the ball up and winning physical battles. Given Brentford just spent around Â£20m on Schade following his move from Freiburg, they may not be in a position to spend big on Balogun."
Chelsea make Â£17m offer for teenage Brazilian striker,"Aug 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-make-17m-offer-teenage-brazilian-striker,"Chelsea have made an offer for 18-year-old Santos striker Deivid Washington, 90min understands. The Blues have not been afraid to splash the cash in the second summer under BlueCo, whose acquisition of Ligue 1 side Strasbourg has seen them step up their pursuits of a number of young talents who could hone their craft in France. There are hopes to use Strasbourg to finally get a deal for Russian starlet Arsen Zakharyan over the line, while Montpellier striker Elye Wahi could be loaned to the French side if a deal can be struck with his current employers. A decision must be made on new midfielder recruit Lesley Ugochukwu and Brazilian winger Angelo, who joined from Santos earlier this summer, has also been tipped for a move to Strasbourg. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea have once again returned to Santos with an offer for 18-year-old Washington. feed A bid of an initial Â£13m, plus a further Â£4m in add-ons, has been lodged by the Blues, who are trying to negotiate a discount on Santos' Â£26m asking price. Clubs across Europe have been following Washington, with Monaco ready to match Chelsea's Â£15m bid if it is accepted, but the Stamford Bridge outfit are working to win the race for his signature and could loan the teenager to Strasbourg if a deal is struck. Ligue 1 rules mean Chelsea can loan just three players out to Strasbourg, who must also adhere to the rule of having no more than four non-EU players on their books, so alternative strategies will have to be taken for some of these proposed loans. Washington has managed 16 senior appearances for Santos and has scored two goals, both of which came in consecutive outings in May."
Chelsea in talks over loan exits for Lewis Hall & Cesare Casadei,"Aug 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-talks-loan-exits-lewis-hall-cesare-casadei,"Chelsea are expected to agree to the loan departures of both Lewis Hall and Cesare Casadei, 90min understands, with talks underway over both players' next moves. Hall, 18, made his breakthrough into the senior side last season, seeing a number of appearances at left-back under Frank Lampard despite most of his academy training coming as a central midfielder. Chelsea have plenty of competition for minutes at left-back, with Ian Maatsen's sensational loan with Burnley seeing him kept in a squad which already includes both Ben Chilwell and Marc Cucurella, and now 90min understands a loan move is on the cards for Hall. Talks are on with Crystal Palace, who are looking to sign Hall on a loan deal which would not include a purchase clause. Chelsea are huge believers in Hall, who has three years remaining on his contract, and want to see the teenager back at Stamford Bridge next summer. The negotiations over Hall are being kept separate from those involving Palace's Michael Olise, for whom Chelsea are confident of getting a deal over the line. feed Hall is expected to be followed out of the door by 20-year-old Casadei who, after six months on loan with Reading last season, is set to get his next taste of senior football with Leicester City. Chelsea had hoped to find a top-flight suitor for Casadei, whose meteoric rise to prominence continued with a stunning Under-20 World Cup campaign this summer, but believe the chance to work under new Foxes boss Enzo Maresca towards the top of the Championship could be beneficial for the Italian. Both players were given a handful of opportunities under new manager Mauricio Pochettino during pre-season but the Blues' bloated squad means there is significant competition for minutes and so the decisions have been taken to look for loan moves. Chelsea will also decide on the futures of fellow young midfielders Andrey Santos and Carney Chukwuemeka, both of whom saw plenty of minutes in pre-season."
Where Josko Gvardiol ranks among most expensive defender transfers ever,"Aug 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/where-josko-gvardiol-ranks-most-expensive-defender-transfers-ever,"Pep Guardiola got in on a joke that has dogged Josko Gvardiol for years. ""What a beautiful surname he has,"" Manchester City's manager grinned before confirming that the Croatian centre-back was undergoing a medical for the European and Premier League champions. Rather than an homage to the Catalan coach, Gvardiol's last name is actually derived from the Latin verb 'guardare', which fittingly translates as 'to guard'. Gvardiol may only be 21 years of age but he has emerged as one of the most highly rated defenders in the world - a lofty billing that is reflected by the hefty fee City belatedly agreed with RB Leipzig this summer. Here's how Gvardiol's transfer to Manchester City compares to the most expensive players to ever guard their own team's goal. Suits you, Josko! ð¤©ð©µ pic.twitter.com/ySy5CfUAQ9 Manchester City's Premier League rivals Chelsea were initially the front runners, failing with an approach for Gvardiol last summer before reigniting their interest in January. Real Madrid entered the race for the Golden Boy nominee, placing Gvardiol top of their centre-back targets in April as reported by 90min. However, Los Blancos have prioritised other areas of the pitch, notably midfield, while Chelsea opted to promote from within by handing the left-footed centre-back Levi Colwill a new six-year deal this summer. City's intent has not shifted even if their patience has been tested. The reigning Premier League champions are no strangers to walking away from a deal which does not match their valuation - as they have previously demonstrated with Harry Maguire, Marc Cucurella and even Declan Rice this summer. At one point in July, RB Leipzig sporting director Max Eberl threatened to step back from negotiations as the clubs remained ""very far apart"". Talks between both parties were gummed up by the proposed fee. RB Leipzig were intent on making Gvardiol the most expensive defender in history, eclipsing the Â£80m which Manchester United spent on Maguire in 2019. Finally, after months of painstaking negotiations, City appear to have won the battle of wills. Three days before Gvardiol was officially unveiled, 90min revealed that Leipzig had settled for an initial fee of Â£77.5m (â¬90m). The final sum for Gvardiol may have just been shy of Maguire's record, but where does he rank on the list of the game's most expensive defenders ever? feed Player Year signed Selling club Buying club Fee Harry Maguire 2019 Leicester Man Utd Â£80m Josko Gvardiol 2023 RB Leipzig Man City Â£77.5m Virgil van Dijk 2018 Southampton Liverpool Â£75m Wesley Fofana 2022 Leicester Chelsea Â£75m Lucas Hernandez 2019 Atletico Madrid Bayern Munich Â£68m Matthijs de Ligt 2019 Ajax Juventus Â£68m Ruben Dias 2020 Benfica Man City Â£62m Achraf Hakimi 2021 Inter PSG Â£59m Matthijs de Ligt 2022 Juventus Bayern Munich Â£59m Marc Cucurella 2022 Brighton Chelsea Â£55m Gvardiol slots into second place on the all-time list of costly defenders, sandwiched between the hulking figures of Maguire and Virgil van Dijk. Liverpool briefly made Van Dijk the most expensive centre-back ever in January 2018, coughing up Â£75m to Southampton. During the previous summer, Van Dijk was accused of going on strike to force through a move by his last Southampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino. The Saints stuck to their guns and kept the unhappy defender on their books for another six months, driving up the price from an initial Â£60m. Unsurprisingly, given the financial clout that the Premier League wields, the four most expensive defenders of all time have been signed by English clubs. Wesley Fofana moved to Chelsea in the summer of 2022 for the same fee as Van Dijk but has come nowhere near the performances produced by the 2019 UEFA Men's Player of the Year. Injury has routinely derailed Fofana's integration in west London. After sitting out 20 games during his debut campaign, the luckless Frenchman ruptured his cruciate ligament in July.  Matthijs de Ligt has been repeatedly linked with a move to the Premier League but is yet to permanently journey across the Channel. The towering Dutch centre-back is the only defender that has ever commanded two separate transfer fees in excess of Â£50m. At just 21, Gvardiol has plenty of time to make another expensive move but he has to guard the goal for Guardiola's team first."
Micky van de Ven set for Tottenham medical ,"Aug 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/micky-van-de-ven-tottenham-medical,"Wolfsburg defender Micky van de Ven is set to undergo a medical with Tottenham ahead of a switch to the Premier League, 90min understands. New manager Ange Postecoglou has publicly called for a new defender to be signed this summer and Spurs have responded with a deal for Van de Ven, which could be worth up to â¬50m (Â£43.5m) including add-ons. With the two teams now simply finalising the last details of a transfer, Van de Ven is heading to England to undergo a medical ahead of signing a long-term contract at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The 22-year-old is set to become Spurs' fourth senior signing of the summer, following James Maddison, Guglielmo Vicario and Manor Solomon in joining the club. feed Despite the imminent deal for Van de Ven, 90min understands Spurs remain interested in Barcelona centre-back Clement Lenglet, who spent last season on loan at the club and has interest from across the globe. Al Nassr have made Lenglet an offer but the Frenchman would rather stay in Europe, where Napoli are also plotting a bid. Spurs also have plenty of potential outgoings to deal with. Atletico Madrid are interested in signing Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg while Davinson Sanchez and Tanguy Ndombele are both targets for Galatasaray. Harry Kane is the subject of a â¬100m (Â£88.5m) bid from Bayern Munich, with Spurs battling to try and convince the striker to sign a new contract. Meanwhile, Spurs have finalised the signing of 18-year-old defender Ashley Phillips from Blackburn Rovers, with the teenager expected to head out on loan."

A five-year contract has been signed by Gvardiol, who becomes City's second arrival of the summer after fellow Croatian Mateo Kovacic's move from Chelsea. ""I have always dreamed of one day playing in England and to be doing so now with Manchester City â after the season they have just had â is a real honour for me,"" Gvardiol said. ""Anyone who saw Manchester City play last season knows they are the best team in the world. To win the Treble says everything you need to know about the quality this team has. ""To be joining City is something very special for me and my family. To have the chance to work with Pep Guardiola, too, will be amazing.

Heâs a top footballer and I hope we can both help City achieve another successful season in 2023/24 and then beyond."" feed Director of football Txiki Begiristain added: ""We are very happy to bring Josko to Manchester City. He is a player we have watched closely, and we feel he has a superb set of attributes. ""Top clubs all over Europe have been monitoring him, so to bring him here is great news for us. ""Josko has so many qualities â everything you want in a centre-half. He is fast, competitive, combative, strong in the air, impressive in possession of the ball, with strong self-belief and a good character.

Chelsea confirm signing of Robert Sanchez from Brighton,"Aug 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-confirm-signing-robert-sanchez-brighton,"Chelsea have completed the signing of goalkeeper Robert Sanchez from Brighton. After searching for a new goalkeeper to compete with Kepa Arrizabalaga, the Blues settled on Sanchez and quickly agreed a fee for the 25-year-old which 90min understands sits around the Â£20m mark. Having passed his medical, Sanchez has put pen to paper on a seven-year contract to become Chelsea's seventh signing of the summer. ""Weâre very pleased to welcome Robert to Chelsea and he adds further quality to our goalkeeping unit,"" said sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley, the latter of whom also joined from Brighton last summer. ""Robert has repeatedly proved himself in the Premier League and been capped by his country. We are excited to watch him work with Mauricio and his coaching team during the season ahead."" feed Sanchez worked closely with Chelsea goalkeeping chief Ben Roberts, who was a coach under Graham Potter at both Brighton and Chelsea before being promoted to a more senior role at Stamford Bridge this summer. Chelsea's current lead goalkeeping coach is Toni Jimenez, who joined as part of Mauricio Pochettino's backroom staff. Sanchez leaves Brighton with 87 Premier League appearances to his name and it is that experience in England which has helped endear him to Chelsea's recruitment team, who wanted an experience name to compete with Arrizabalaga. Thanks to his time in the Brighton academy, Sanchez also counts as a homegrown player in the Premier League, which comes as a boost to a Chelsea squad which has already bid farewell to Mason Mount and Ruben Loftus-Cheek this summer."
West Ham agree Â£26m deal to sell Gianluca Scamacca,"Aug 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-agree-26m-deal-sell-gianluca-scamacca,"West Ham United have agreed to sell Gianluca Scamacca to Atalanta in a deal worth â¬30m (Â£26m), sources have confirmed to 90min. The 24-year-old was one of the Hammers' marquee signings last summer, alongside Lucas Paqueta, but it was quickly apparent that a change in playing style would be needed to get the best out of the Italian. Injury complaints didn't help Scamacca in trying to settle in London, and he was unable to command a regular starting spot despite costing David Moyes and West Ham in excess of Â£30m when joining from Sassuolo. Scamacca scored eight goals in all competitions from 27 appearances, but crucially netted just three times in the Premier League for West Ham, who laboured to 20 defeats from their 38 league games but did end their 43-year trophy drought by winning the Conference League. 90min revealed in early June that Roma had shown an interest in taking Scamacca back to Serie A, with the player showing a desire to return to his homeland. Jose Mourinho's side were unable to fund a permanent deal, however, and were instead looking to conclude a loan with option or obligation to buy. Inter also made a bid for Scamacca but sources have confirmed to 90min it's Atalanta who have agreed a deal with West Ham. feed Last season's Europa League quarter-finalists will pay a guaranteed â¬25m (Â£21.6m) for Scamacca, with a further â¬5m in achievable add-ons included into the deal, and are set to partner him up with AC Milan's Charles De Ketelaere, who is nearing a loan move with option to buy. 90min understands that Scamacca is already en route to complete a medical, ending his stay in east London after just a year of the five he committed to little over 12 months ago. Scamacca's exit is another blow to a West Ham side who are yet to make a senior signing this summer - they are the only Premier League club who haven't - amid disagreements between Moyes and new technical director Tim Steidten over how to replace Declan Rice, who joined Arsenal earlier this summer in a British-record Â£105m deal. West Ham are also yet to appoint a new club captain, even though the new Premier League season gets underway in six days when newly-promoted Burnley take on Manchester City."

The most expensive Premier League transfer windows ever,"Aug 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/most-expensive-premier-league-transfer-windows-ever,"The Premier League has firmly cemented itself as the financial powerhouse of both European and world football - at least until the Saudi Pro League started throwing ridiculous wages around. The spending power of the biggest clubs in England's top flight is almost unrivalled in Europe with even mid-to-lower table sides now on a par with many top teams in Italy, Germany and Spain. For that reason, the general trend of spending figures in Premier League transfer windows is only going up, even if it's not quite as simple as the final figure being higher year on year. Here are the six highest-spending Premier League transfer windows ever. That such a recent year is down in sixth place is due to the real effects of the Covid-19 pandemic that began to be felt by football clubs. Less so at Premier League level, of course, but it still existed.Major moves in this summer transfer window included Romelu Lukaku's return to Chelsea from Inter for Â£103.5m, Jack Grealish's switch from Aston Villa to Manchester City for Â£100m and Jadon Sancho's Â£76.5m arrival at Manchester United from Borussia Dortmund. A big summer for a number of teams, Liverpool spent big to bring in Alisson for Â£66.8m and Naby Keita for Â£48m, as well as Fabinho for Â£39m. Man City splashed out on Riyad Mahrez for Â£60m from Leicester, while Chelsea paid Â£71.6m for Kepa Arrizabalaga.Fred arrived at Man Utd for Â£47m and there were also plenty of mid-level deals done by some of the smaller sides in the league, such as Richarlison's Â£25m move to Everton. You may expect this transfer window to have been more depressed due to the Covid-19 pandemic but there was little knowledge at this stage about just how disrupted life was going to be over the next couple of years.For that reason, Premier League spending was around the sort of level that had become the norm in the few years prior. Chelsea spent Â£222.5m in this window on players like Kai Havertz, Timo Werner and Ben Chilwell. Man City signed Ruben Dias for Â£61m, while Liverpool forked out Â£40m on Diogo Jota. This was a record-breaking year at the time and really made a lot of people sit up and realise just how much the Premier League was now able to spend.Mohamed Salah arrived at Liverpool, though only for a modest fee of Â£34m, while Man Utd spent Â£146m on Romelu Lukaku, Nemanja Matic and Victor Lindelof. Man City parted with Â£211m on various players that included Ederson, Danilo, Kyle Walker and Bernardo Silva."
USMNT midfielder Yunus Musah completes transfer to AC Milan ,"Aug 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/usmnt-yunus-musah-completes-transfer-ac-milan,"Serie A giants AC Milan have confirmed the signing of US men's national team midfielder Yunus Musah from Valencia. The 2021/22 Scudetto winners have splashed the cash this summer after Sandro Tonali joined Newcastle, with Musah now the second USMNT player to join the historic Italian side after star forward Christian Pulisic made the move from Chelsea to Milan earlier this summer. The 20-year-old leaves La Liga side Valencia after making 108 appearances and scoring five goals in all competitions. Before joining Valencia in 2019, Musah was part of Arsenal's U18 squad from October 2017 to August 2019. At the international level, Musah represented England at the U17 and U18 level before switching his allegiance to the US in 2020. He's 27 appearances for the USMNT since 2020 and was key to the Stars and Stripes' Nations League triumphs in 2019/20 and 2022/23. ""AC Milan is pleased to announce the signing of Yunus Musah on a permanent basis. The midfielder has signed a contract with the Club until 30 June 2028,"" an AC Milan club statement read. âï¸ The ink is dry, and the future is bright! ðð´â«ï¸ #ACMQuest #SempreMilan pic.twitter.com/k8Tl84wUWH"
Why would Tottenham want to sign Alejo Veliz?,"Aug 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/why-would-tottenham-want-sign-alejo-veliz,"As the coronavirus pandemic forced the world to pause, Alejo Veliz seriously considered pressing stop on his dreams of becoming a professional footballer. The 16-year-old had just begun pre-season with Central Rosario's youth team when COVID-19 hit. ""I couldn't go back and I started to think about studying something because it took too long,"" Veliz remembered. ""Thank God I stayed."" Veliz made his debut for the senior side 18 months after the pandemic's outbreak and has been a fixture of the first team since 2022. This summer, the teenager has attracted increasing interest from the Premier League's Tottenham Hotspur. Aside from an iron will, here's why Spurs are leading the race for a player who almost gave up the game entirely three years ago. ð¥ðºð¦  Alejo VÃ©liz, 1 a 0 y explota el Gigante pic.twitter.com/mIBkaAWChy Veliz made his debut for Central in July 2021. Within 12 months, he had entered club folklore. Half-time was rapidly approaching in the fiercely contested Rosarian derby against Newell's Old Boys when Jhonatan Candia swung a free kick into the box. Veliz, who stands at 6'1, out-jumped his marker to loop Central into a lead. The only goal of the game sparked an ear-splitting roar in the Gigante de Arroyito. Veliz has many years of football ahead of him but will have to go some way to top a decisive contribution against your first club's biggest rivals. The winner against Newell's was only the third goal of Veliz's senior career but it would prove to be a prescient participation. Six of Veliz's 19 goals for Central exploded off his forehead and all three of his strikes during this year's under-20 World Cup were headers. Harry Kane broke the Premier League record for headed goals in a single season last term, notching ten. Tottenham's talisman took advantage of the team's myriad of set-piece ploys sketched up by the specialist coach Gianni Vio. The Italian may have parted ways with the club this summer but new manager Ange Postecoglou developed a range of routines during his time at Celtic. While Veliz would offer another aerial target other than Kane it would be an almighty task for the youngster to replace the England captain entirely if a move to Bayern Munich does materialise. Veliz may be one of the Argentine top flight's most exciting young strikers but he is best described as promising rather than prolific and still has plenty of rough edges to smooth - notably, his ability (or willingness) to create for others. If the teenager does move to Tottenham, it will surely be in an understudy role to the first choice option - whether that be Kane or the misfiring Richarlison. What Veliz does bring in abundance is grit. During Carlos Tevez's brief five months as Central coach, Veliz said that he ""took every piece of advice he gave me"". That tenacity embodied by the former Manchester United and Manchester City striker is evident in Veliz on and off the pitch. In April of this year, the day after scoring in a 2-2 draw against Boca Juniors, Veliz was driving to training when he was T-boned by a truck which fled the scene. He started Central's next match the following week. Just four days after playing in Argentina's last-16 exit from this summer's under-20 World Cup, Veliz not only appeared for Central but scored in a 4-1 win over Instituto. Team Appearances Goals Assists Rosario Central 62 19 2 Argentina Under-20s 9 3 0 feed An impressive tally of 11 goals in 23 top-flight games for Central this year - the highest tally of any teenager in the division - has attracted interest from across Europe. The bulk of bids swamping Rosario Central's transfer department stemmed from Serie A. AC Milan, Roma, Salernitana and Torino all expressed interest in the 19-year-old, who set tongues wagging at a greater velocity with his forceful displays in this year's under-20 World Cup. Tottenham's Premier League rivals Nottingham Forest also flirted with Veliz but 90min understands that the striker is prioritising a move to north London after Spurs agreed to meet his Â£13m release clause. However, when Veliz will line up for the Lilywhites remains to be seen. Spurs are expected to hand Veliz a long-term deal but may be prepared to loan the striker back to Central in the immediate future. The Rosario club are certainly trying to keep hold of their talented forward - who would join the likes of Angel Di Maria and his potential Tottenham teammate Giovani Lo Celso in big-money moves away from Central. Talk of a loan until January, if not longer, has been floated. Just three short years ago, Veliz didn't look like making a professional appearance for any club, let alone one in the world's biggest league."
Bayern Munich submit club-record offer for Harry Kane,"Aug 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-submit-club-record-offer-harry-kane,"Bayern Munich have made a club-record â¬100m bid for Tottenham striker Harry Kane, 90min understands. England captain Kane has been Bayern's top transfer target all summer and the two clubs recently met for talks in London. The Bundesliga giants left with optimism that a deal this summer could be struck. Bayern previously had two offers rejected, the second of which amounted to â¬80m (Â£68.5m), and 90min can confirm their third offer totals â¬100m (Â£86m). Spurs have been hesitant to sell but there has been pressure on chairman Daniel Levy within the club's hierarchy to consider selling Kane to avoid losing him for free next summer. Thomas Tuchel's side are unlikely to return with a higher bid if Tottenham are left unsatisfied with the third offer. Bayern do, however, want a decision over the sale to be made quickly by Spurs. Tottenham have been confident throughout the summer of keeping the 30-year-old even though his deal expires next year. The north London side remain hopeful Kane will sign a new contract and plan to work on fresh terms during Ange Postecoglou's first season in charge. feed Spurs informed Kane at the start of the transfer window they had no plans to sell him, with Manchester United, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain among the European heavyweights eyeing a move. The start of the new Premier League season is only a week away and Spurs have brought in James Maddison, Guglielmo Vicario and Manor Solomon, also making the loans for Dejan Kulusevski and Pedro Porro permanent. Progress has been made in the pursuit of centre-back Micky van de Ven, while Spurs have also agreed to meet the release clause of Rosario Central striker Alejo Veliz."
Pep Guardiola issues warnings to Barcelona & Bayern Munich over Bernardo Silva & Kyle Walker,"Aug 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/pep-guardiola-issues-warnings-barcelona-bayern-munich-bernardo-silva-kyle-walker,"Pep Guardiola has challenged both Barcelona and Bayern Munich to make better offers for Bernardo Silva and Kyle Walker as the Manchester City manager prepares for a battle to keep hold of both players. The two City stars have been approached over summer exits but Guardiola does not want to weaken his squad any further, having already lost both Ilkay Gundogan and Riyad Mahrez during this transfer window. While Guardiola has long insisted he will not block any unhappy player from leaving, he warned both Barca and Bayern that City will not simply hand their players away for cheap. ""I don't want any players who don't want to be here but I'm an employee. I want to work with guys who want to stay and work with staff and players, but after we have to get a proper offer,"" Guardiola explained. ""If we don't get a proper offer, he's our player and we want him. If they want him, they will take a plane and come here and talk to our sporting director and CEO to make an agreement because three parts have to be there. ""For us to buy a player, just because we are Man City it is Â£10-15m more expensive than other clubs all the time. If people want our really really important players, first they have to make an offer - and that hasn't happened. When it happens, we will fight to extend the contract and be with us. That has happened with all of our players since day one."" feed Guardiola went on to stress that the challenge of replacing two undisputed starters on a treble-winning side would be a costly operation and so those players will only be sold for substantial offers. ""When you win the Treble, it looks like the job is done. Players who are 32, 33 like Ilkay and Riyad say we arrived here for Premier Leagues and then people ask about the Champions League,"" he continued. ""Some players feel they want a new experience. I will not be the guy who says no - but they have to make an agreement with the important part of the club, the business. Make a deal and it happens. ""In the case of Bernardo and Kyle, we talk many times over the last months and even years how important they are, how we want them and we will continue to do so until the end. I don't know what will happen but it won't happen if the clubs don't arrive because they are massively important players. ""When we lose those players we have to go to the market for the replacements and these players and they cost more than Â£50m. We need that money to reimburse on other players to make the team as strong as possible to defend the crowns that we won and win games for our people."""
Pep Guardiola confirms Josko Gvardiol's Man City medical,"Aug 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/pep-guardiola-confirms-josko-gvardiol-man-city-medical,"Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has confirmed that RB Leipzig centre-back Josko Gvardiol is undergoing a medical ahead of a proposed move to the Etihad Stadium. City have struck a deal worth an initial Â£77.5m to sign Gvardiol, with add-ons which could see the transfer become the most expensive ever to involve a centre-back. Guardiola has now confirmed that Gvardiol, who's childhood nickname was Guardiola due to the obvious similarities between the two names, is in Manchester to put the finishing touches on his move. ""Gvardiol, what a beautiful surname he has!"" Guardiola joked during a press conference. ""He is doing a medical test. Everybody knows he is here. Hopefully, we can finish the deal in the next few hours or days."" feed Should all go according to plan, Gvardiol would become the sixth centre-back in the City squad alongside Ruben Dias, John Stones, Manuel Akanji, Nathan Ake, Aymeric Laporte, while Kyle Walker often inverts from right-back as well. ""The season is so long. [Six] is not too much],"" Guardiola said of his defensive group. Walker is facing an uncertain future at City as Bayern Munich try to lure the England international away, but Guardiola is prepared for a fight to keep him. He said: ""[Walker] is so important to us. We want [him] and will do everything. We want him to stay because he wants to stay. We will do everything."""
Arsenal submit opening bid for Brentford's David Raya,"Aug 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-submit-opening-bid-brentford-david-raya,"Arsenal have submitted an opening offer for Brentford goalkeeper David Raya, 90min understands. Brentford have made it clear all summer that they are prepared to sell Raya, who is in the final year of his contract, for Â£40m - an asking price which scared off Tottenham before they signed Guglielmo Vicario instead. After expressing an interest in Raya earlier this week, Arsenal have now opened the bidding with an offer which 90min understands is closer to half of Brentford's asking price. An initial Â£20m has been proposed, with Arsenal also prepared to pay up to Â£5m in potential add-ons. Brentford are expected to reject the offer as they stand firm on their asking price. Manager Thomas Frank recently insisted Â£40m is cheap for Raya, pointing to Arsenal's decision to sign another player in the final year of their contract, Declan Rice, for Â£105m. feed Arsenal are not alone in their pursuit of Raya, with German giants Bayern Munich also keen on the Spaniard as they seek to replace Yann Sommer, who is expected to join Inter. Sommer has acted as cover for the injured Manuel Neuer after the German broke his leg following the conclusion of the World Cup but is expected to leave this summer and Bayern are keen to move for Raya, although Brentford's asking price continues to prove problematic. Raya himself confessed earlier this summer that he feared Brentford's Â£40m demand would price him out of a transfer, although the 27-year-old vowed to respect his club's decision and remain focused on the job if he is not granted an exit. As for Brentford, they have already signed a replacement for Raya, striking a deal to recruit Dutch international Mark Flekken from Freiburg last month."

A Â£38m deal was agreed with Monaco earlier this week to bring Disasi, who was playing alongside current Blues defender Benoit Badiashile last season, over to Stamford Bridge. The deal is now complete, with 25-year-old Disasi signing a six-year contract to commit himself to Chelsea until 2029. ""Axel has showcased his quality over several seasons in France and that has deservedly led to recognition on the international stage,"" said sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart, the latter of whom joined from Monaco in February. ""He is ready to take the next step in his career and we are delighted that will be with Chelsea. We welcome him to the club and look forward to him joining up with Mauricio Pochettino and his new teammates in the days ahead."" feed Disasi becomes Chelsea's sixth signing of the summer, following Christopher Nkunku, Nicolas Jackson, Lesley Ugochukwu, Angelo and Diego Moreira in putting pen to paper on contracts at Stamford Bridge. A move for Disasi was accelerated after it was revealed that fellow defender Wesley Fofana had undergone surgery on an ACL injury which will keep him out for the majority of the coming campaign. Chelsea are well-stocked at centre-back, where Disasi's former Monaco teammate Badiashile joins Thiago Silva, Levi Colwill and Trevoh Chalobah as available options for the coming campaign. Pochettino enjoyed an unbeaten pre-season and will return to Premier League action when Liverpool make the trip to London on 13 August."

The game kicks off at 12:45, with Hojlund expected to be in attendance. feed It will be the first time United have played at Old Trafford this summer and so home fans will also get their first glimpses of fellow new signings Mason Mount and Andre Onana, who joined earlier this summer from Chelsea and Inter respectively. Results have been mixed for Erik ten Hag's side this summer. After kicking off pre-season with victories over Leeds, Lyon and Arsenal, United have lost three on the bounce against Wrexham, Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund. Ten Hag labelled United's performance against Dortmund ""unforgivable"" and will demand more from his side in front of their home fans against Lens. United are also due in Dublin's Aviva Stadium on Sunday for one final friendly against Athletic Club."

Brighton inform Moises Caicedo of transfer decision amid ongoing Chelsea interest,"Aug 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/brighton-inform-moises-caicedo-transfer-decision-chelsea-interest,"Brighton & Hove Albion have made it clear to Moises Caicedo that he will not be sold unless their Â£100m valuation of him is met, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Ecuador international is continuing to be courted by Chelsea, who have already seen two bids - the first worth Â£70m and the second worth Â£80m - knocked back by the Seagulls. 90min understands that Caicedo has confirmed his desire to leave Brighton on several occasions this summer.

Brighton value Caicedo at a similar amount to Declan Rice, who recently signed for Arsenal from West Ham United for a British-record Â£105m transfer fee, and this has been explained to the player and his representatives. Chelsea remain undeterred in their pursuit of Caicedo and will continue their advances.

Transfer notebook: Galatasaray discuss Tottenham duo; Bournemouth win race for Italy midfielder,"Aug 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/transfer-notebook-galatasaray-tottenham-duo-bournemouth,"Tottenham Hotspur are in talks with Galatasaray over the potential sale of two first-team players, sources have conformed to 90min. Spurs are looking to trim down their squad for new head coach Ange Postecoglou and ahead of a season in which they will not be competing in European football for the first time since 2009/10. 90min reported last month that Davinson Sanchez had been granted permission to discuss a move away, with Strasbourg and Spartak Moscow interested in his services. Talks are ongoing with the Russian club over a move, but they now face competition from Turkish side Galatasaray, who recently bolstered their ranks with the high-profile addition of Wilfried Zaha. Sanchez has other suitors from the Premier League too, with Fulham, Nottingham Forest and Wolves all making enquiries to Spurs. Galatasaray have also been offered the chance to bring in Tottenham's club-record signing Tanguy Ndombele. The France midfielder spent last season on loan at Napoli, helping them win Serie A, and he is now seen as a possible alternative to Manchester United's Fred by Galatasaray. Ndombele was set to feature on Spurs' pre-season tour of Australia and Asia, but sustained an injury prior to their first friendly and has only just returned to training. feed Lazio are on the verge of signing free agent Daichi Kamada after AC Milan backed out of a deal last month.

Al Ahli to beat Juventus & Tottenham to signing of Franck Kessie,"Aug 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/al-ahli-to-beat-juventus-tottenham-signing-franck-kessie,"Barcelona midfielder Franck Kessie is closing in on a move to Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Ivory Coast international only joined Barca from AC Milan on a free transfer last summer, and despite scoring a memorable last-minute winner against Real Madrid on their way to La Liga title glory, he was scarcely afforded extended chances at Camp Nou. 90min reported on Wednesday that Tottenham Hotspur had held talks with Barcelona over signing Kessie as well as teammate Clement Lenglet, who spent last season on loan in north London. But 90min understands that Spurs are again set to miss out on a long-term target in Kessie as he has agreed to join Saudi outfit Al Ahli. Barcelona had initially assumed that Kessie's preference was to remain in Europe, but they will now sit down to thrash out a â¬15m (Â£13m) with Al Ahli, who have also signed Edouard Mendy, Roberto Firmino, Riyad Mahrez and Allan Saint-Maximin this transfer window. feed Crucially, Barcelona will not have to pay a portion of Kessie's wages in order to get him off their books, allowing them further flexibility under La Liga's strict financial restrictions. In addition to Tottenham, Juventus had also been eyeing Kessie and had made a tentative loan offer to Barcelona. The Bianconeri have since turned their attention back to Arsenal's Thomas Partey, but the Gunners' â¬46.5m (Â£40m) price tag is proving prohibitive at this moment. Juve and other interested clubs could test Arsenal's resolve after the start of the 2023/24 season if he is not a guaranteed starter. With the departures of Kessie and Ousmane Dembele likely to be confirmed in the coming days, Barcelona are set to make a combined â¬65m (Â£56m) in player sales for the duo and are now ramping up efforts to sign Joao Cancelo from Manchester City."
Players Barcelona should sign with Ousmane Dembele fee,"Aug 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/players-barcelona-should-sign-with-ousmane-dembele-fee,"Barcelona winger Ousmane Dembele is closing in on a move to French champions Paris Saint-Germain. 90min understands that he has agreed personal terms over a move back to his homeland and could even be unveiled as a new PSG player by the end of the week. It will bring an end to Dembele's six-year stint in Catalonia - a spell which has been largely underwhelming considering the promise he arrived with and the â¬145m (Â£125m) total fee paid to Borussia Dortmund. PSG will fork over â¬50m (Â£43m) for Dembele. Here are the players Barcelona could, and perhaps should, recruit with that sum. feed Head coach Xavi admitted earlier this week that he is in desperate need of a new natural right-back. ""The right-back is a position that we should look at again, and reinforce,"" he said. ""We have players who adapt but they are not in their natural positions. We will see how everything turns out and how we also fit into financial fair play."" Few modern day full-backs fit the Barcelona mould the way that Joao Cancelo does. 90min reported on Wednesday that Barca are reigniting their interest in the Portugal international having tried but failed to sign him during the January transfer window. Barcelona would prefer to take Cancelo, who has four years left to run on his Manchester City contract, on an initial loan with an option to buy. Classic Barca trying to kick the can down the road. Right, let's move on to actual winger targets and not just any old player that Barcelona are actively talking about. 90min reported last month that Man City were battling PSG and RB Leipzig for Lyon winger Bradley Barcola, seeing him as a potential replacement for Riyad Mahrez. Barcola ended his breakout 2022/23 season with seven goals and ten assists in 35 games for Lyon. If Barcelona want one of Europe's up-and-coming wide threats, then they should consider entering these sweepstakes. Villarreal winger Yeremy Pino is quickly announcing himself as one of Spanish football's top prospects. He has spent three full seasons in the Yellow Submarine's first team and was part of their Europa League-winning contingent of 2021, while he played a starring role in Spain's Nations League triumph in June. Pino's â¬80m (Â£69m) release clause may prove prohibitive to Barcelona unless they shift a few more players, such as Tottenham targets Franck Kessie and Clement Lenglet. This would be a highly ambitious move and one that would stretch Barcelona in a financial sense, but Joao Felix is a player that would love to make the move and would certainly raise the technical levels of La Blaugrana. In fact, Felix recently discussed his desire to play for Barcelona in an interview with Fabrizio Romano, saying: ""I'd love to play for Barca. Barcelona has always been my first choice and I'd love to join Barca. It was always my dream since I was a kid. If it happens, it will be a dream come true for me."" The endless link. Bernardo Silva has continually been tipped to leave Man City and it is usually Barcelona touted as the destination. Barca are still interested, but due to the aforementioned sale of Mahrez, 90min understands that Siva will be staying put at the Etihad Stadium. A versatile Ajax forward who has World Cup experience but has only been linked with a move to the Premier League? This sounds like something Barcelona should be all over. Mohammed Kudus has been the rare shining light for both club and country over the last year, turning on the style in poor Ajax and Ghana teams. 90min understands he is wanted by Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United, who could all probably out-bid Barcelona if push came to shove, unfortunately. Electrifying and fleet-footed, Jeremy Doku would make for a nice project to succeed Dembele. The 21-year-old hasn't quite kicked on since his marvellous performances at Euro 2020 but he has continually been linked with the continent's biggest clubs. Why couldn't it be Barcelona that takes a punt on his potential and upside?"
Newcastle agree deal for Tino Livramento,"Aug 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/newcastle-agree-deal-tino-livramento,"Newcastle United have agreed a transfer fee with Southampton for full-back Tino Livramento, sources have confirmed to 90min. It is understood the deal is worth around Â£35m to Southampton with another Â£5m in add-ons, although a sell-on clause will means at least 40% is due to former club Chelsea. Livramento is now due in the north east for his medical ahead of putting pen to paper on a long-term contract which is already agreed. Newcastle have been wanting to bolster their full-back option this summer and Livramento emerged as their top target. The 20-year-old can play on both sides, whilst current right-back and Kieran Trippier can also switch to the left offering additional options to Eddie Howe. The Livramento deal will represent Newcastle's third major transfer of the summer following on from the captures of AC Milan's Sandro Tonali and Leicester City's Harvey Barnes. Overall, it takes their spending for this transfer window through the Â£100m barrier.  90min understands that a right-sided centre-back and a 'number 10' remain in their sights. Financial Fair Play (FFP) issues are a consideration for Newcastle and are anxious not to breach the regulations. But they are exploring additional options such a possible loan deals with mandatory fees which will allow them to circumnavigate some of those concerns. feed 90min can also confirm Newcastle are also continuing to work hard on finalising a new contract for Brazilian star Bruno Guimaraes. The 25-year-old has been in talks over a new deal and personal terms are not seen as a major issue. However, the talks have stalled and Guimaraes himself recently admitted that he was not sure where the deal was and Howe is pushing for Newcastle to get it done. Howe said: ""There is no doubt in my mind about his future. We would love Bruno to extend his time with us for a long time. I'm not party to those talks every day. Those talks are ongoing and Bruno knows how we feel about him. He's very happy here. We hope there's a solution to be found."""
Ousmane Dembele set to complete PSG move from Barcelona,"Aug 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ousmane-dembele-set-complete-psg-move-barcelona,"Barcelona winger Ousmane Dembele is in line to complete a move to Paris Saint-Germain by the end of the week, 90min understands. 90min reported on Monday that Dembele had agreed personal terms over a move back to France, which came as a bit of a shock to the footballing world considering there had been little speculation suggesting he was looking to leave this summer. Barca head coach Xavi and new club captain Sergi Roberto have both spoken of their surprise and disappointment of Dembele's fresh intentions to leave. Sources have now confirmed to 90min that PSG are closing in on the signing of Dembele after paying a â¬50m (Â£43m) release clause in his Barcelona contract. With that money, the Spanish champions will step up their pursuit of Manchester City's Joao Cancelo. Xavi spoke earlier this week of his desperation to bring in a new right-back and the sale of Dembele should allow them further flexibility in the summer transfer market. feed PSG are hoping to finalise Dembele's move by the end of the week, and 90min understands they are also looking to push through a move for Benfica forward Goncalo Ramos in that timeframe as well. Both head coach Luis Enrique and sporting advisor Luis Campos are keen to add Ramos to their ranks. The French champions previously held an interest in Manchester United-bound Rasmus Hojlund. Ramos is expected to arrive for a fee in the region of â¬80m (Â£69m), while PSG retain an interest in his Portugal teammate Joao Felix. The 23-year-old spent the second half of last season on loan at Chelsea but has since returned to Atletico Madrid. PSG's negotiations with Atleti are not currently advanced, though the deal is not completely dead yet."
Tottenham agree to meet Argentina youth international's Â£13m release clause,"Aug 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-agree-argentina-youth-international-13m-release-clause,"Tottenham have agreed to meet the Â£13m release clause of Rosario Central youngster Alejo Veliz, 90min understands. Spurs recently opened talks with the Argentine club for 19-year-old Veliz, who had also attracted interest from AC Milan, Roma, Salernitana and Nottingham Forest. The 19-year-old rose to global prominence during the 2023 FIFA Under-20 World Cup as part of Argentina's squad, scoring three times before his side were knocked out in the last 16 by Nigeria. Rival interest had arisen from Serie A and the Premier League but 90min has been told the young striker made Tottenham his preferred destination which has helped with negotiations. A long-term contract is in the works and no issues are expected to flare up between Veliz and Spurs in that department. Veliz scored 11 times in the 2023 Argentine Primera Division, only two fewer than joint-leading scorers Pablo Vegetti and Michael Santos. He made his debut for Central in 2021 during a Copa Sudamericana clash with Deportivo Tachira and has since netted 19 goals in total for the club. feed Discussions are now being held over Veliz's short-term future. Rosario are keen to keep the teenager - who turns 20 in September - until January on loan and possibly beyond. Tottenham have long needed back-up options for Harry Kane, whose own future in north London is under extreme scrutiny with Bayern Munich confident of completing a deal for the England captain. Richarlison suffered an injury-hit first campaign with Spurs but would be the obvious replacement up front if Kane does leave before the season starts. A central defender is still being targeted with talks advancing for Wolfsburg's Micky van de Ven as new head coach Ange Postecoglou looks to fix a defence that conceded 63 Premier League goals last season. Out of favour Barcelona duo Franck Kessie and Clement Lenglet - the latter of whom spent last season in north London - remain targets, while Denmark international Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg could be shipped off to Atletico Madrid."
Arsenal hold talks with Burnley over Albert Sambi Lokonga exit,"Aug 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-talks-burnley-albert-sambi-lokonga-exit,"Burnley are locked in talks with Arsenal over a move for Belgian midfielder Albert Sambi Lokonga, 90min understands. Lokonga joined from Anderlecht in the summer of 2021 for a fee of around for around Â£18m but has struggled to find his place at the Emirates and ended last season out on loan with Crystal Palace. Now back with Arsenal, the 23-year-old picked up an injury which prevented him from travelling with the squad for their pre-season campaign, only adding to the frustration surrounding his time in north London. Arsenal are open to parting ways with Lokonga and sources have confirmed to 90min that Burnley have explored a move for the midfielder. The newly promoted side are looking to land Lokonga's signature on a season-long loan deal which would include an obligation for a permanent transfer next summer. feed Lokonga has managed 39 appearances for Arsenal but has seen competition for midfield minutes ramped up by the expensive signings of both Declan Rice and Kai Havertz for a combined Â£170m this summer. Thomas Partey has also been welcomed back into Arsenal's squad after initially being given permission to explore interest from Saudi Arabia, while the Gunners remain interested in signing 23-year-old Brazilian Bitello from Gremio. As a result, Lokonga is one of a handful of first-team players over whom tough decisions will need to be made in the coming weeks. Striker Folarin Balogun could be sold after a Â£50m price tag was placed on the United States international's head, while the likes of Nuno Tavares and Nicolas Pepe are expected to depart."
Chelsea agree fee with Brighton over Robert Sanchez,"Aug 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-agree-fee-brighton-robert-sanchez,"Chelsea are closing in on the signing of goalkeeper Robert Sanchez from Brighton, 90min understands. The Blues sold Edouard Mendy to Al Ahli earlier this summer and have been on the hunt for more experienced competition for Kepa Arrizabalaga, and club officials have now settled on a move for Sanchez. Sanchez, 25, lost his place as Brighton's starting goalkeeper midway through last season as Roberto De Zerbi preferred the ball-playing abilities of Jason Steele, while the Seagulls have also brought in Bart Verbruggen from Anderlecht for just over Â£16m this summer. Sources have now confirmed to 90min that Sanchez is closing in on a move to Chelsea. A fee has been agreed between the two clubs, and with personal terms not an issue, Sanchez is now expected to undergo a medical imminently ahead of putting pen to paper on a contract at Stamford Bridge. Much of the club's push for Sanchez has come from goalkeeping chief Ben Roberts, who worked with the Spaniard as a coach at Brighton before following Graham Potter to Chelsea, where he was eventually promoted to a role which sees him involved in goalkeeper recruitment. feed Chelsea have been looking for a high-level goalkeeper to provide competition for Kepa and began the summer exploring a deal for Andre Onana, only to allow the Cameroon international to move to Manchester United instead. A bid for AC Milan's Mike Maignan was also ruled out due to the Italian side's high asking price. Sanchez's Premier League experience, coupled with the fact he counts towards Chelsea's homegrown quota thanks to his time in the Brighton academy, has helped endear him to the club's recruitment department. Talks remain on between Chelsea and Brighton over midfielder Moises Caicedo, for whom the Blues have seen multiple bids rejected already this summer. An Â£80m offer was swiftly rejected by Brighton, who are holding out for Â£100m to part ways with their star midfielder."

Tottenham advance negotiations with Wolfsburg for Micky van de Ven,"Aug 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-advance-negotiations-wolfsburg-micky-van-de-ven,"Tottenham Hotspur are progressing in talks to sign Micky van de Ven from Wolfsburg, sources have confirmed to 90min. Spurs have been on the hunt for reinforcements at centre-back following a Premier League campaign which saw them concede a staggering 63 goals - the third worst record among teams that were not relegated to the Championship. New head coach Ange Postecoglou has made public his desire to bring in new defenders this transfer window, with 90min previously reporting that Van de Ven and Bayer Leverkusen's Edmond Tapsoba were their top targets. Bayer Leverkusen's demands of a fee in excess of Â£43m for Tapsoba may have proven too much for Tottenham however, as 90min understands they are now advancing with a Â£35m deal to bring in Van de Ven from fellow Bundesliga side Wolfsburg. feed The 21-year-old has played 41 times for Wolfsburg since his 2021 move from Dutch second division side Volendam, announcing himself as one of Europe's top young defenders. After a delay in finalising the deal, Spurs are also expected to complete the signing of highly-rated 18-year-old Ashley Phillips from Blackburn Rovers this week. Meanwhile, 90min reported earlier on Wednesday that Tottenham had held talks with Barcelona regarding the potential re-signing of former loanee Clement Lenglet if deals for either Tapsoba or Van de Ven fell through.

Man Utd confirm goalkeeper departure,"Aug 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-confirm-goalkeeper-departure,"Manchester United goalkeeper Nathan Bishop has joined Sunderland on a permanent transfer, ending his three and a half year spell at Old Trafford. Bishop was 20 years of age when he joined United from Southend United in January 2020, having already played 31 times in League One over several seasons with the Shrimpers. The goalkeeper linked up with Unitedâs Under-23 squad, before then playing a full season on loan at Mansfield in League Two in 2021/22. He leaves without making a competitive first-team appearance. The 23-year-old now joins a Sunderland side targeting a return to the Premier League after reaching the Championship playoffs last season. The likelihood is he will provide competition and cover for established Black Cats number one Anthony Patterson. ""You see the direction that the club is going, playing young players and allowing them to express themselves and push on in a great league,"" Bishop said of Sunderland. ""I think that is so exciting, so I want to come in and earn the right to play for such a great team and a great club."" feed Bishop most recently hit the headlines during Unitedâs pre-season tour, featuring in the friendly against Wrexham in San Diego. He was involved in an unfortunate collision with Paul Mullin that left the Wrexham striker with a punctured lung. There was backlash from opposing fans, while Wrexham manager Phil Parkinson also slated Bishop for his involvement in the incident. But the goalkeeper apologised to Mullin and was also personally contacted by Wrexham co-owner Ryan Reynolds to thank him for how he handled things. Manchester United are left with Andre Onana, Tom Heaton and Dean Henderson are their first-team goalkeepers, although the latterâs future remains uncertain. Czech pair Matej Kovar and Radek Vitek have also played a part with the senior squad during pre-season."
Tottenham continue talks with Atletico Madrid over Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg sale,"Aug 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-continue-talks-atletico-madrid-pierre-emile-hojbjerg,"Tottenham Hotspur are looking to finalise the sale of Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg to Atletico Madrid, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Denmark international is heading into his fourth season at Spurs but could yet find himself at a different team before the end of the summer transfer window. 90min were first to report back in June that Tottenham would consider offers for Hojbjerg, and Atletico Madrid are in talks over a deal. Los Rojiblancos are looking to add another combative midfielder to their ranks. They have earmarked Hojbjerg and Fiorentina's Sofyan Amrabat as options, though 90min understands that the latter is the subject of intense interest from Manchester United and they will ramp up efforts to sign him once they clear their wage bill. Atletico Madrid are therefore expected to pivot to Hojbjerg as their top target, though are reluctant to pay more than Â£30m for his services. feed Spurs began the summer window with a Â£40m valuation of the midfielder, who turns 28 later this week. However, with few other suitors stepping forward, they could lower this asking price and their stance that they will not stand in the way of an exit remains. When asked specifically about the club's interest in Hojbjerg, Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone said: ""There are names the club is working on to address the situation of necessity and obligation. The club will decide, we need a new midfielder."" During Tottenham's two pre-season friendlies under new head coach Ange Postecoglou thus far, Hojbjerg has been used with the squad's second unit, with Yves Bissouma preferred as a holding midfielder and Oliver Skipp, James Maddison and Pape Sarr starting ahead of him in a more advanced role. Hojbjerg joined Tottenham from Southampton during the summer of 2020 for an initial Â£15m fee. He has played 145 games in his three seasons at the club."

Xavi admits Ousmane Dembele disappointment ahead of Barcelona exit,"Aug 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/xavi-admits-ousmane-dembele-disappointment-barcelona-exit,"Manager Xavi has confirmed Ousmane Dembele has requested to leave Barcelona after agreeing personal terms with Paris Saint-Germain. France international Dembele became one of the most expensive players ever when Barca paid Borussia Dortmund an initial Â£97m in 2017, with add-ons potentially taking the deal up to Â£135.5m. Dembele suffered consistent injury issues in his first few years at Camp Nou but returned to form last term, contributing five goals and seven assists in 25 La Liga games. However, his six-season stay in Catalonia is expected to end soon. 90min reported earlier this week Dembele has agreed personal terms to join PSG on a five-year deal, with the Ligue 1 holders also in talks with Barca over a fee to sign the France international.  Following Barcelona's 1-0 pre-season win over AC Milan, Xavi confirmed to Relevo Dembele's desire to leave and admitted he is not happy with how the situation has played out.

Said that he wanted to leave, that he had spoken with Luis Enrique, with Nasser and has a proposal with which we cannot compete. We have asked him the reason and he has not been able to answer.

Bayern chose not make the move permanent and Cancelo has since returned to City. The German champions have instead turned to Cancelo's City team-mate Kyle Walker and they are still hoping to sign him. Cancelo has little desire to remain at City and the feeling at the club is mutual. Pep Guardiola has not changed his stance in wanting him moved on from the club. Arsenal have shown an interest in Cancelo and they remain keen on the full-back, but it is Barcelona who are now stepping up their efforts. feed Barcelona's finances are still far from secure and any deal will need to be sanctioned by La Liga. However, the likely sale of Ousmane Dembele to PSG means that they will have room to manoeuvre and a new right-back is seen as one of their priorities. Speaking after their pre-season win against AC Milan, head coach Xavi said: ""The right-back is a position that we should look at again, and reinforce. We have players who adapt but they are not in their natural positions. We will see how everything turns out and how we also fit into financial fair play."" Real Vallodolid's Ivan Fresneda is an option they are also considering, but Cancelo is believed to be their main priority and they are ready to push ahead with a move.

Arsenal to test Brentford's resolve with offer for David Raya,"Aug 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-test-brentford-resolve-offer-david-raya,"Arsenal will enter talks with Brentford over the potential transfer of goalkeeper David Raya and could make a bid close to their lofty asking price, sources have confirmed to 90min. Raya is into the final year of his contract at the Gtech Community Stadium and has publicly admitted to turning down several offers to commit his long-term future to the Bees. Though Brentford are willing to let Raya go this summer, they have reiterated for months that they will only consider offers of Â£40m. 90min were first to report back in March they are even open to him leaving on a free transfer next summer, and this stance remains despite signing Mark Flekken from Freiburg. Tottenham Hotspur had agreed personal terms with Raya in June but were unwilling to meet Brentford's demands and instead signed Guglielmo Vicario from Empoli, while Bayern Munich have also been put off by such a high figure. feed 90min reported on Monday that Arsenal were exploring a deal for Raya, who would crucially count as a homegrown player under Premier League and UEFA regulations. The Gunners have now reached a broad agreement with the Spain international over a contract. Arsenal are now preparing an offer to present to Brentford which could come close to their Â£40m valuation, though this would be made up with a significant sum of add-ons. Raya is pushing for Brentford to allow him to move to the Emirates Stadium, where he is prepared to play second fiddle to Aaron Ramsdale. Arsenal's number one signed a new long-term contract earlier this summer.

West Ham transfers: Ajax hijack Borges deal; Inter bid for Scamacca & Ward-Prowse move in limbo,"Aug 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-transfers-ajax-borges-inter-bid-scamacca-ward-prowse,"West Ham United have been beaten to the signing of young Manchester City star Carlos Borges by Dutch giants Ajax, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 19-year-old had looked to be heading to London Stadium in a deal worth just under Â£15m, having scored 21 goals at Premier League 2 level last season. Europa Conference League holders West Ham had agreed to insert a buy-back clause into the deal for Borges, allowing City to re-sign the rapid winger in the future should he prove to be a star turn in east London. But with Borges away playing for Portugal's Under-21s at the European Championship this summer, before taking a holiday, West Ham have not been able to iron out the final details of the deal. And sources have now confirmed to 90min that former Champions League winners Ajax, who had a pretty poor 2022/23 by their usual standards, have stolen in ahead of West Ham to take Borges to Amsterdam. It's understood that personal terms are already agreed between Borges and Ajax, who will pay City the same amount of money West Ham were going to, and he's now heading to the Netherlands to complete a medical.  One factor in his decision is believed to be a more appealing route into regular first team football, which may not have been on offer had he remained in the Premier League playing under David Moyes. West Ham have turned down a loan to buy bid from Inter for wantaway striker Gianluca Scamacca. 90min previously revealed that the powerful Italian, who only joined West Ham from Sassuolo last summer, was keen to return to Italy, though the Hammers had no intention of letting him leave until a replacement had been sought. The club's recruitment team are yet to make any real progress on that front, despite technical director Tim Steidten recommending Montpellier striker Elye Wahi, but Scamacca is attracting significant interest from his homeland. Roma had previously made West Ham a loan to buy offer worth close to â¬25m (Â£21.5m), but the bid was based on the club qualifying for the Champions League - something that West Ham felt was not a good enough guarantee. Milan and Atalanta have also been showing interest in Scamacca, but sources have confirmed to 90min that Inter have made their first official move. They have also offered to take the the 24-year-old on loan initially, but their bid was only worth â¬2m for the duration of the loan deal before an obligatory purchase of â¬20m. West Ham are believed to want â¬30m (Â£25.8m) for Scamacca, and it's expected that Inter will up their offer having already an approach for Arsenal's Folarin Balogun turned down. One of the sagas of this summer, from a West Ham perspective, has been how to replace Declan Rice in midfield. West Ham's former captain pocketed the club a British-record Â£105m fee, with the deal including a significant chunk of that money up front - money that was earmarked to sign at least one replacement. Contrasting opinions from Moyes and Steidten have seen West Ham identify a wide variety of potential targets, including Southampton captain James Ward-Prowse. The 28-year-old is facing up to the prospect of playing in the Championship following the south coast club's relegation, but had shown interest in joining West Ham. Moyes had pushed for West Ham to move for Ward-Prowse, but the club's valuation of the set-piece specialist is noticeably different to how Southampton see things - they value him at Â£35m whereas West Ham's offer this summer was only worth Â£20m. Talks have continued, in the hope that the two parties could find a compromise, but at this stage there's no willingness from either party to fold. West Ham have a number of other players to consider and are believed to have also been put off by Ward-Prowse's current wage packet, which pockets him over Â£100,000-per-week."
Sadio Mane officially unveiled by Al Nassr,"Aug 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/sadio-mane-officially-unveiled-al-nassr,"Al Nassr have unveiled Sadio Mane following completion of his transfer from Bayern Munich. Mane had initially resisted interest from the Saudi Pro League, before performing a surprise U-turn and agreeing personal terms with Al Nassr in July. Bayern were open to selling Mane, who had a disappointing first season following a big money move from Liverpool, as soon as the 2022/23 club campaign ended. At first, it was Al Ettifaq showing interest following the appointment of Steven Gerrard as manager. But terms were quickly agreed once Al Nassr stepped in, with Mane still reluctant to make the move to Saudi Arabia as recently as early July. In the words of Bayern coach Thomas Tuchel, Mane ""fell short of expectations"" during his what will now have been his sole season with the club. feed The Senegal international was often used in an alien central role following the departure of Robert Lewandowski and frustrations eventually boiled over to the point where he physically lashed out at teammate Leory Sane, landing an international suspension and club record fine. Mane now links up with Cristiano Ronaldo at the Riyadh-based Al Nassr. Since signing Ronaldo in the winter, the club have remained busy in the transfer market this summer. Mane is the fourth high profile player to make the switch from Europe in recent weeks, following in the footsteps of Marcelo Brozovic, Seko Fofana and Alex Telles. Mane's quick move on from Bayern without triggering the add-ons in his 2022 transfer from Liverpool is set to deny the Premier League side as much as Â£7.5m in additional income."
Chelsea sign Â£25m midfielder from Rennes,"Aug 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-sign-25m-midfielder-rennes,"Chelsea have completed the signing of 19-year-old midfielder Lesley Ugochukwu from Rennes. The Blues agreed a Â£25m fee with Rennes in late July, prompting the final processes of the transfer â including a medical â to be undertaken in the days since. Ugochukwu has signed a seven-year contract until 2030, with an option to extend by 12 months.

Southampton reject second Liverpool bid for Romeo Lavia,"Aug 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/southampton-reject-second-liverpool-bid-for-romeo-lavia,"Southampton have rejected a second bid from Liverpool for midfielder Romeo Lavia, 90min understands. Lavia has attracted plenty of interest from towards the top of the Premier League after Southampton's relegation, but it is Liverpool who are currently pushing hardest for his signature. A Â£35m bid was knocked back last month and sources have confirmed to 90min that Liverpool have now seen an improved offer, worth Â£42m including add-ons, rejected by Southampton. While Southampton would prefer to keep Lavia, they are prepared to cash in for the right price and have placed a firm price tag of Â£50m on the 19-year-old, who only joined from Manchester City last summer for an initial Â£10.5m. Talks will continue between the two sides and Liverpool are expected to return with an improved bid in the near future, with Jurgen Klopp keen to add a third new face to his midfield after the signings of Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai. feed Liverpool are hopeful a deal can be reached soon but are also looking at potential alternatives if Southampton refuse to drop their asking price. One of those on Liverpool's shortlist is 22-year-old Fluminense midfielder Andre Trindade, who nearly joined Fulham in January and remains on the radar of the Cottagers. Fulham have been in talks with Andre but believe the once-capped Brazil international has his sights set on a move to a team capable of offering regular European football. Alongside Liverpool, Andre's representatives have spoken with Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Arsenal, Tottenham and West Ham. Liverpool have lost both Jordan Henderson and Fabinho to the Saudi Pro League this summer and now hope to find another new midfielder to balance out the squad, with Lavia understood to be Klopp's preferred target."
Diego Simeone gives uncertain update on Joao Felix's future amid Barcelona links,"Aug 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/diego-simeone-gives-uncertain-update-joao-felix-future-barcelona-links,"Diego Simeone has insisted that 'nobody is more important than the club' when quizzed on Joao Felix's future at Atletico Madrid.  Felix spent the second half of last season on loan at Chelsea and has been linked with a permanent move away from Atletico this summer, with Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona the most notable parties that are interested in his services.  The forward recently sparked fury at Atleti by publicly admitting he would like to to join Barcelona, leading to furious demonstrations from fans.  In an interview with AS, Simeone declined to give a definite response to questions over Felix's future but warned the Portugal international that 'nobody is bigger than the club'. ""The main focus is the team,"" he said. ""It is normal that in the press the focus is on whether he stays or leaves. I already said that there is no-one more important than the club, with no exceptions. Itâs impossible to be clearer than that."" feed Felix joined Los Rojiblancos back in 2019 for an astonishing Â£103m, and although he has not lived up to his price tag thus far, Simeone did not want to criticise the 23-year-old. ""He has his playing characteristics, he has given his all, he has made an effort to work well with what he has, and what we demanded of him,"" Simeone reflected. ""I cannot have any complaints about his effort because he has given what he could give. ""He has extraordinary ability, we have talked about it a billion times. You see him and he has a good header, a good shot with the left, with the right, good spin, one on oneâ¦ Is there time [for Felix to succeed at Atletico]? Itâs not up to me, ask him and his representative."""
Dusan Vlahovic offered to Chelsea in Romelu Lukaku swap deal,"Aug 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/dusan-vlahovic-offered-to-chelsea-in-romelu-lukaku-swap-deal,"Juventus have proposed the idea of sending striker Dusan Vlahovic to Chelsea in a deal which would see Romelu Lukaku move in the opposite direction, 90min understands. After Inter abandoned their interest in a reunion with Lukaku, Juventus reached out to Chelsea to propose a loan deal for the Belgian but saw their offer instantly rejected, with a temporary departure not in Chelsea's plans. Sources have confirmed to 90min that the Turin outfit have now returned with a fresh proposal, offering Chelsea the chance to land Vlahovic as part of their push to offload Lukaku. Chelsea are known admirers of Vlahovic and made contact with the striker's representatives earlier this summer as part of their search for a new striker. Nicolas Jackson was signed from Villarreal but Blues boss Mauricio Pochettino recently confessed he would be interested in adding another new striker. In negotiations, Juventus have made it clear that they would want Chelsea to pay a fee on top of swapping Lukaku, and the Blues are now considering their options as they seek to finally cut ties with their wantaway striker. feed Lukaku still retains interest from Saudi Arabia but the 30-year-old wants to remain in Europe and dreams of a return to Italy, where Juventus are his only viable suitors after Inter walked away from talks. The Belgian's representatives are now pushing hard for an agreement with Juventus and there is hope that the chance to sign Vlahovic, who managed ten goals in 27 Serie A outings last year, could help accelerate a deal. Chelsea do have a number of names on their radar, including versatile Ajax star Mohammed Kudus. Personal terms have been discussed with the Ghana international, who played as a midfielder under former boss Erik ten Hag but exploded when switched to striker last season. Summer signing Jackson has impressed in pre-season alongside fellow new face Christopher Nkunku, while 21-year-old Armando Broja is hopeful of returning from his ACL injury to hand Pochettino even more options in attack."
Bayern Munich confident of Harry Kane deal after Tottenham meeting,"Aug 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-harry-kane-deal-tottenham-meeting,"Bayern Munich are confident their next bid for Tottenham striker Harry Kane will be successful following the latest meeting between the two clubs, 90min understands. Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen and technical director Marco Neppe were both in London on Monday to meet with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy for a second time this summer. Although a deal was not agreed or a even third bid lodged, sources have told 90min that Bayern left the meeting with some confidence that their next offer will be enough to persuade Levy to sell. Bayern have seen two bids rejected by Spurs, the last of which was worth â¬80m (Â£68.5m), and they are now ready to make a third offer which would represent a club-record transfer for the Bavarian giants. Sources believe that Bayern feel that an offer of â¬100m (Â£85.6m) will be enough to persuade Levy and Tottenham to think about taking a deal, even though the north Londoners have made it clear this summer that they do not have a price in mind. manual There is also some pressure on Levy, even within Spurs' hierarchy, to consider selling Kane, rather than run the risk of losing him on a free transfer next summer once his contract expires. Spurs remain confident they can persuade Kane to sign a new contract, to the extent that they're willing to make him the highest-paid player in the Premier League on wages of Â£400,000-per-week. Levy also feels that anyone is capable of convincing the 30-year-old to stay put, it's new head coach Ange Postecoglou. Bayern's belief is that they already have a broad agreement in place with Kane's camp, and that if they can strike an agreement with Spurs, he'll be heading to Munich ready to compete for the Champions League. As it is, Kane is facing up to the prospect of a season without European football - Spurs finished 8th in the Premier League last season and parted ways with head coach Antonio Conte in March."
Jurgen Klopp laughs off Liverpool links to Kylian Mbappe,"Aug 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jurgen-klopp-laughs-off-liverpool-links-to-kylian-mbappe,"Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has laughed off suggestions that the Reds could move for Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe this summer.

There is a long history of speculative links between Liverpool and Mbappe but, even with the latest attempts to fuel the fire, Klopp insisted he would be more surprised than anyone if there was any substance to the rumours. ""We laugh about it,"" Klopp told Sky Germany about the rumours. ""I can say that I think he is a really good player. But the financial framework conditions donât suit us at all.

That would be the first time."" manual 90min understands PSG have been seeking to drum up interest in Mbappe this summer with a view to cashing in on the 24-year-old, who club officials fear is already set on joining Real Madrid on a free transfer in 2024. Among the teams to have been contacted are Chelsea who, while obviously more than happy to sign Mbappe, are well aware of just how unlikely such a move would be. The Frenchman's representatives have not yet given any indications that a switch to the Premier League is under consideration. Just what will happen with Mbappe this summer remains to be seen, but whatever decision is taken, new PSG defender Milan Skriniar insists the Parisian squad will accept it.

Should all go to plan, Hojlund will become United's third signing of the summer, following Mason Mount and Andre Onana in agreeing moves to Old Trafford. Denmark teammate Christian Eriksen recently gave fans an insight into what they can expect from Hojlund, telling PA: ""What's he like? He's a strong number nine. He's developed a lot in the last year from when I first saw him with the national team [to] a year's time, so, yeah, he's a very good player."" feed Eriksen continued: ""I suppose we don't get enough media attention in Denmark that's why, so people outside Denmark don't know enough.

PSG contact Chelsea in attempt to push Kylian Mbappe transfer,"Jul 31, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-contact-chelsea-attempt-push-kylian-mbappe-transfer,"Paris Saint-Germain are continuing to offer Kylian Mbappe to clubs around Europe, including Chelsea, sources have told 90min.

After holding a meeting with Levy earlier this month, Bayern had planned for a second set of face-to-face talks with the Spurs chairman last week but saw those plans pushed back at the last minute. Now, the two Bayern officials are expected to front a group of Bayern representatives which will touch down in London on Monday for their long-awaited talks over Kane's future. Two bids from Bayern have already been knocked back by Levy who, up to this point, has not named an asking price or even given any indication that he would be prepared to accept a bid for his talismanic striker this summer. However, with Kane entering the final year of his contract, Spurs owner Joe Lewis has intervened and is understood to have told Levy to authorise a sale if an agreement to extend Kane's contract cannot be struck. feed A club-record bid from Bayern, whose transfer record currently stands at the â¬80m paid to sign Lucas Hernandez from Atletico Madrid in 2019, is expected to arrive imminently, with the German side determined to take advantage of Kane's expiring contract to get a deal done. There has been plenty of speculation over the reason for the cancellation of last week's meeting between Bayern and Spurs but the German side's president, Herbert Hainer, insisted there was nothing malicious going on. ""Sometimes people read too much into normal processes,"" Hainer told TZ. ""What I can say is that Daniel Levy is a professional. We all have the utmost respect for him."""
Mauricio Pochettino sends pointed transfer message to Chelsea owners,"Jul 31, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/mauricio-pochettino-sends-transfer-message-chelsea-owners,"Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino believes it is 'clear and obvious' that the Blues must make a new signing in defence following the injury to Wesley Fofana. Fofana has undergone surgery on an ACL injury and is facing a lengthy spell on the sidlines, leaving Chelsea with four senior centre-backs: Thiago Silva, Benoit Badiashile, Levi Colwill and Trevoh Chalobah, the latter of whom has been heavily linked with an exit. A Â£38m deal has been struck with Monaco to sign France international Axel Disasi, a former teammate of Badiashile, and while Pochettino refused to discuss the 25-year-old, he acknowledged a defensive reinforcement is necessary. ""With Fofana's injury, I think it is obvious that maybe we need to reinforce this area,"" he told the media after Sunday's 2-0 friendly victory over Fulham. ""It is clear."" Pochettino is also hoping for senior reinforcements in midfield and wants more than the proposed deal to sign 19-year-old Rennes starlet Lesley Ugochukwu, who is expected to move to Stamford Bridge but could head to sister side Strasbourg on loan. feed ""We need experience in midfield,"" he explained. ""I have the information you have. My information is a player that is from France that maybe they sign with the idea to send on loan."" One area in which Pochettino is not so desperate for signings is at striker. New faces Nicolas Jackson and Christopher Nkunku have both enjoyed impressive pre-season campaign thus far, with the latter bagging his third goal of the summer against Fulham, although the Chelsea boss remains open to another signing up front. ""I think we are happy with the performance and they can complement each other really well,"" he said of his two strikers. ""Yes, of course, maybe we can add some different profile or different player who can help us, of course we are open.  ""I am so happy with both and we have younger like Mason [Burstow] today and [Armando] Broja in the UK recovering from his procedure. We need to analyse now in the next weeks until the transfer window closes. We will take the best decision for the team."" Asked how many new signings he wants, Pochettino responded: ""I don't know because if I say numbers I can create a problem. For me it's important, the club is working really hard to improve all of the areas, the right profiles to make the squad strong. The club is working really hard to find the right profile."""
Jurgen Klopp calls for patience for Liverpool summer signing,"Jul 31, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jurgen-klopp-calls-for-patience-for-liverpool-summer-signing,"Jurgen Klopp has admitted he was impressed with new signing Alexis Mac Allister in Liverpool's recent 4-0 win over Leicester City but urged fans to remain patient with the Argentine as he gets used to life at Anfield. A Â£35m signing from Brighton earlier this summer, Mac Allister has seen plenty of minutes during pre-season and really made an impact during the recent 4-0 victory over Leicester, being singled out by Klopp after the game. ""When we found Macca between the lines, he was really good,"" Klopp told The Athletic. ""That helped us speed the game up."" Even though he has already been impressed by Mac Allister, Klopp insisted the 24-year-old is not yet at his best and warned fans he will need time to fully learn his place in Liverpool's system. ""Good player. These things, it needs time,"" Klopp said of Mac Allister. ""Even in the season it's not that you have the first game and then it's the best game of the season - that would be really horrible if that would be the case. feed ""So, we have to work on it and we work on that. We have a lot of options in the areas and the boys need to show up.  ""It's not pressure, it's just the situation because I think it was clear when we scored in the first half three goals but second half Cody [Gakpo] and Dom [Szoboszlai] and Luis [Diaz] and Ben [Doak], to be honest, that was pretty special. And Harvey [Elliott] as well really showed up."" Liverpool have two more friendlies before their Premier League campaign gets underway, beginning with a huge clash with German giants Bayern Munich on Wednesday. Darmstadt, who were promoted back to the Bundesliga last season, are the final opponents on Monday 7 August, before Liverpool kick off the 2023/24 season with a visit to Stamford Bridge to face Chelsea on the following Sunday."
Ousmane Dembele agrees personal terms with PSG,"Jul 31, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ousmane-dembele-agrees-personal-terms-psg,"Ousmane Dembele has agreed personal terms with Paris Saint-Germain, signalling his desire to leave Barcelona, sources have confirmed to 90min. As 90min confirmed last week, PSG recently reached out to the 26-year-old, who has entered the final 12 months of his contract at Camp Nou. Barcelona, however, are keen to keep Dembele and have been locked in talks over a new deal for months, but progress is yet to be made. The France international is eyeing a substantial pay rise after agreeing to slash his wages on the short-term deal he inked with Barcelona only last summer. With no agreement in sight, PSG have made their move in the hope of luring Dembele back to Ligue 1, where he shone with Rennes before his switch to Borussia Dortmund in 2016. Dembele has a clause in his contract that would allow him to leave for â¬50m if it is triggered by midnight on Monday, the end of July, after which the clause doubles to â¬100m. PSG could finalise the signing of Dembele by paying his release clause, and that is an option now personal terms are agreed. An agreement over a five-year deal has been reached between Dembele and PSG, who have informed Barcelona of the situation. The two clubs have held talks and how they develop in the coming hours will determine whether PSG will need to pay the release clause or come to agreement with Barcelona. feed While Barcelona want Dembele to stay, they have also made it clear that they do not want to lose him for nothing next summer and so have reluctantly opened the door to a departure.  The plan at Camp Nou was for Barcelona to part ways with two of their four senior wingers - Dembele, Raphinha, Ansu Fati and Ferran Torres - this summer. Initially, Barcelona wanted to offload Fati and Torres but both have been incredibly reluctant to entertain departures. The La Liga champions, who still hope to raise more funds through player sales this summer, have been forced into taking a decision over Dembele, whose willingness to agree terms with PSG is expected to impact their next move. PSG have made their move for Dembele at the same time as they battle with Kylian Mbappe over his future, but the club insist that their interest in the Barcelona star is not directly related."
Arsenal explore move for Brentford goalkeeper David Raya,"Jul 31, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-explore-move-brentford-goalkeeper-david-raya,"Arsenal have spoken with the representatives of Brentford goalkeeper David Raya over a summer switch to the Emirates, 90min understands. Raya has entered the final 12 months of his contract at the Brentford Community Stadium and has made it clear he is keen to move on this summer, with clubs from across Europe expressing an interest in his services. A number of Premier League sides have looked at Raya, while German giants Bayern Munich are also keen on the Spain international. Arsenal, who wanted Raya before they struck a deal to sign Aaron Ramsdale in the summer of 2021, have now re-joined the race for the 27-year-old. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Arsenal are looking to sign another high-level goalkeeper to provide more competition for Ramsdale and Raya is happy to enter into a battle for a starting spot - a message he also conveyed to Manchester United when the Red Devils enquired earlier this year. feed Brentford have publicly valued Raya at Â£40m and continue to stand firm on that price tag, which already derailed talks with Tottenham and has scared off numerous other suitors. Arsenal are also reluctant to pay such a high fee for a player entering the final year of a contract and, as such, have also enquired about Brighton goalkeeper Robert Sanchez as a possible alternative. Chelsea are also interested in Sanchez, another Spain international. The Gunners are prepared to allow current backup Matt Turner to leave this summer, with a loan exit a possibility at this point. Interest in Turner has comefrom Nottingham Forest, who are exploring their options amid their own concerns over the asking price of Manchester United's Dean Henderson."

Chelsea confident of signing Crystal Palace star Michael Olise,"Jul 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-confident-of-signing-crystal-palace-star-michael-olise,"Chelsea are confident that they have won the race to sign Michael Olise from Crystal Palace, 90min understands.  90min recently reported that Olise had attracted interest from Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City during the summer transfer window following an eye-catching 2022/23 campaign with Palace. Last season, Olise became the first Palace player ever to record more than 10 Premier League assists in a single season as he led the south London club to safety alongside fellow young talent Eberechi Eze.  Despite the interest from the Premier League's top two of last season, sources have now confirmed that Chelsea believe they have won the race for Olise's signature. Olise's younger brother, Richard, is also currently on the books and the Blues' strong relationship with the family has helped with the Blues' bid to sign the talented France Under-21 international.  feed Due to a 'mechanism' in his Crystal Palace contract, Olise is available for just Â£35m this summer - a small fee for a talented youngster with proven Premier League experience.  Palace have already moved to try and replace Olise, as well as Wilfried Zaha who left as a free agent to join Galatasaray, as 90min understands that the club are close to sealing a deal to sign Brazilian youngster Matheus Franca.  The south Londoners are set to pay an initial Â£17m plus Â£8.5m in add-ons in order to sign the young attacking midfielder. Key to negotiations over Franca has been Palace's co-owner John Textor's connections in Brazil, with Textor also being a co-owner of Brazilian club Botafogo. "
How Rasmus Hojlund fee compares to most expensive signings in Man Utd history,"Jul 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/how-rasmus-hojlund-fee-compares-to-most-expensive-signings-in-man-utd-history,"It was not a given that Rasmus Hojlund had the potential to rank as one of the most expensive transfers in the history of a club with the stature of Manchester United. ""In Copenhagen,"" Hojlund recalled when looking back on his time at his hometown club, ""they were not really sure about me being the next big thing."" Just 18 months after leaving the capital club for Â£1.5m, with zero goals in Denmark's top flight to his name, Hojlund is now on the cusp of joining Manchester United for a fee in the region of Â£72m - 48 times the sum that Copenhagen received in January 2022. Here's how the transfer of a player that is very much billed as ""the next big thing"" compares to the most expensive deals Manchester United have ever made. Manchester United have agreed a fee with Atalanta for the transfer of Denmark striker Rasmus Hojlund. ð©ð°ð¯https://t.co/rDhWZFVPBY Hojlund needed little persuading to agree on personal terms with United - the club he grew up supporting in Denmark. ""Now that you ask,"" Hojlund admitted in January, ""I will not hide the fact that I am a huge Manchester United fan.""  However, the striker's employers were not so easily wooed. Back at the start of July, 90min revealed United's interest in Hojlund as talks between the Red Devils and Serie A side Atalanta began. United were initially unwilling to venture above their opening offer of Â£51.6m but Atalanta stood firm on their valuation of a player they only signed for Â£15m last summer. Paris Saint-Germain complicated the negotiation process by wading in with a bid of their own. The French champions, who are embroiled in a stand-off with their current star forward Kylian Mbappe, fired a Â£42.9m verbal offer over to Atalanta. It did not take long for the Bergamo outfit to reject the inquiry. Shortly after Erik ten Hag publicly stressed his desire to acquire a striker as soon as possible, United took a large step towards completing the deal by agreeing on a fee with Atalanta. The two parties have arrived at the compromise of a fixed Â£64m up-front sum with Â£8m available in potential add-ons. United had previously floated the idea of including players in a partial swap deal but Atalanta's iron will appears to have won out. Player Year signed Signed from Transfer fee Paul Pogba 2016 Juventus Â£89m Antony 2022 Ajax Â£82m Harry Maguire 2019 Leicester Â£80m Romelu Lukaku 2017 Everton Â£75m Jadon Sancho 2021 Borussia Dortmund Â£73m Rasmus Hojlund 2023 Atalanta Â£72m* Casemiro 2022 Real Madrid Â£60m Mason Mount 2023 Chelsea Â£60m Angel Di Maria 2014 Real Madrid Â£59.7m Andre Onana 2023 Inter Â£47.2m Hojlund stands to become United's most expensive signing in a summer of consolidation ahead of Ten Hag's second season as manager.  Strung-out negotiations with Chelsea eventually ended in the arrival of Mason Mount as United's first high-profile addition of pre-season. The England international could cost the Red Devils as much as Â£60m if all bonuses are hit. United replaced the outgoing David de Gea with the most expensive goalkeeper in the club's history, signing Andre Onana from last season's Champions League finalists Inter for a fee that could rise to Â£47.2m. Jadon Sancho arrived on a wave of even greater hype than Hojlund in 2021. The former Borussia Dortmund starlet, who had put up considerably more impressive figures across a longer period of time than the Dane, cost Â£73m. Yet, during his first two seasons at Old Trafford, Sancho directly contributed to fewer goals than Fred. feed There was hope that the much-maligned Brazilian midfielder, who cost United Â£47m in 2018, would produce performances worthy of his fee following the arrival of his international teammate Casemiro. The five-time Champions League winner was 30 when United forked out an initial sum of Â£60m last summer. Aside from a surprisingly active disciplinary record, Casemiro proved to be good value for money after his debut campaign. Hojlund, aged just 20, has plenty of time to live up to his transfer. Yet, Paul Pogba toiled away against his price tage for six seasons after returning to Old Trafford for a then-world-record fee of Â£89m in 2016. The club are yet to make a more expensive signing and will have to go some way to find an individual that divides opinion as much as the World Cup winner."
Why Sadio Mane's proposed Saudi Arabia transfer will cost Liverpool,"Jul 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/why-sadio-mane-proposed-saudi-arabia-transfer-will-cost-liverpool,"Sadio Mane's proposed transfer to Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia is set to see former club Liverpool miss out on a chunk of extra income. The deal agreed between Liverpool and Bayern Munich for Mane last summer started at around Â£27.5m in a guaranteed transfer fee. But the overall package was inflated by Â£7.5m worth of add-ons that were dependent on the player hitting certain targets in Bavaria. Such performance-based add-ons can often include things like appearances or goals. But Mane didn't have a particularly good debut season with Bayern, playing only 25 times in the Bundesliga, scoring just nine league goals and generally underperforming. manual At one stage, Mane was internally suspended by Bayern and fined a club record amount for lashing out at teammate Leroy Sane, with coach Thomas Tuchel eventually concluding that the Senegal international had fallen 'short of expectations'. Now that he is set to move on from Bayern to join Al Nassr, the Daily Mail has reported it will cost Liverpool. The various add-ons in the 2022 transfer agreement didn't end up being triggered and are set to be lost as soon as the player has a new club. Liverpool would have been hopefully of those add-ons being achievable, yet now won't see that additional money coming in. Mane was initially resistant of a switch to the Saudi Pro League. As 90min reported at the time, Al Ettifaq were the team initially interested in signing the 31-year-old. However, not long after making clear his intention not to engage with talks, Mane agreed personal terms with Al Nassr in principle."
Chelsea close to deal for Monaco centre-back Axel Disasi,"Jul 31, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-close-to-deal-for-monaco-centre-back-axel-disasi,"Chelsea are nearing an agreement with Monaco to sign centre-back Axel Disasi, 90min understands. In response to a thoroughly disappointing 12th-placed finish in the Premier League last season, Chelsea's ownership embarked upon a fire sale during the opening month of the summer window. More than Â£200m has been raised in player sales this summer - most of which were completed before 30 June so that they could be included in the accounts for the 2022/23 campaign. After jettisoning the likes of Kai Havertz, Mateo Kovacic and Christian Pulisic, Chelsea are now in a position to provide new manager Mauricio Pochettino with fresh recruits. Chelsea signed Disasi's former teammate Benoit Badiashile from Monaco in January and, just seven months later, are closing in on a reunion for the duo in west London. 90min understands that the Blues are in talks with Monaco and a fee in the region of Â£38m has been floated. feed Chelsea were one of three Premier League clubs that sent scouts to watch Disasi at Monaco in April, as 90min revealed. Manchester United have prioritised other areas of the pitch while Manchester City's focus has shifted to RB Leipzig centre-back Josko Gvardiol. Chelsea have also harboured a long-term interest in the Croatian defender but are expected to miss out on the 21-year-old as City prepare a world-record bid. Newcastle United also showed interest in the 25-year-old but, just like Manchester United, never made an official bid - much to Disasi's disappointment after targeting a move this summer. The day before the news broke of Chelsea's impending agreement with Disasi, 90min reported that the Blues had taken a major step in the recruitment of Rennes midfielder Lesley Ugochukwu.  Chelsea are thought to be open to loaning Ugochukwu to their sister club Strasbourg in Ligue 1 but Disasi is expected to stay in the capital and provide some much-needed cover for a thin defence. Following Wesley Fofana's ACL surgery earlier this summer, Chelsea only have two right-footed options at centre-back; 38-year-old Thiago Silva and Trevoh Chalobah, who has attracted interest from several Premier League clubs. The club felt this was inadequate. The Blues did explore the option of bringing Crystal Palace centre-back Marc Guehi back to Stamford Bridge this summer but baulked at the lofty asking price and the player's wage demands. Former Manchester United skipper Harry Maguire also emerged as a shock alternative in the search for Fofana replacements. The England international would have initially arrived on loan but, again, the overall package proved too rich for Chelsea's taste."
Thomas Tuchel hints at Bayern Munich confidence in signing Harry Kane,"Jul 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/thomas-tuchel-hints-at-bayern-munich-confidence-in-signing-harry-kane,"Bayern Munich coach Thomas Tuchel appeared to hint at the club's ongoing confidence that a deal for Harry Kane will be struck before the end of the summer when he refused to properly address the immediate future of emerging talent Mathys Tel over what could yet happen. Bayern retain longstanding interest in Kane and have been tracking the Tottenham striker ever since Robert Lewandowski was sold to Barcelona last summer without being directly replaced. The German champions have already seen two bids for Kane rejected, while a fresh meeting with Spurs official scheduled for last Friday ended up being postponed as talks continue. 90min reported on Friday that the clubs are now expected to meet in the coming days instead and that there remains a confidence on the German side that a deal will eventually be reached. feed Tuchel seemed to allude to that when he spoke about 'changes' that Bayern expect will happen. ""We will discuss the exact future of Mathys as soon as something changes here and that could be much later in the transfer window,"" the coach explained. Tel joined Bayern from Rennes last year and only recently turned 18. He has already been likened to fellow countryman Kylian Mbappe and made 29 first-team appearances throughout 2022/23. Although Bayern won the Bundesliga again last season, they struggled without a direct replacement for Lewandowski. Sadio Mane was often asked to fill the void in what was an alien role for him, with the title not actually won until the final day of the season ahead of Borussia Dortmund."
Xavi makes Barcelona transfer window demand,"Jul 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/xavi-makes-barcelona-transfer-window-demand,"Barcelona manager Xavi Hernandez has called on the club to sign more players during the summer transfer window. Barca have signed fours players this summer thus far, with three of said signings available to play for the club at the start of the 2023/24 season - Brazilian starlet Vitor Roque has also signed but will not arrive at Camp Nou until 2024.  The club signed Oriol Romeu, as a replacement for Sergio Busquets, for Â£5m from La Liga club Girona, while the other two acquisitions made were free agents Ilkay Gundogan and Inigo Martinez.  Speaking after Barca's impressive 3-0 win over Madrid in Dallas, Texas, on Saturday night, manager Xavi addressed the club's lack of spending this summer, and revealed that he has informed Barcelona president Joan Laporta of the need to strengthen the first-team squad: ""I think are lacking [a few players]. We have to strengthen ourselves a little more. The president and the sports management know it. To be competitive we have to strengthen ourselves. ""I believe a lot in this team, but I think we need something more. My pending task as a coach is to compete more there. We don't hide. It's one of the objectives of the season."""
Xavi provides update on Ousmane Dembele's future amid PSG interest,"Jul 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/xavi-provides-update-on-ousmane-dembele-future-amid-psg-interest,"Xavi Hernandez has insisted the Ousmane Dembele is ""happy"" at Barcelona amid transfer links to Paris Saint-Germain.  90min reported earlier this week that the Ligue 1 champions had opened talks with Barcelona over a potential move for Dembele to the Parc des Princes. The France international is available for as little as â¬50m (Â£42.9m) before July 31 due to a release clause in his contract - a release which doubles after that date.  News of PSG's interest emerged due to Dembele's contract talks with Barca not progressing as the club had initially hoped. While talks are due to continue, sources have told 90min that Xavi Hernandez's side would be willing sell the player for the right price if he asks to leave.  Despite the rumours circling regarding his future, Dembele has been one of the stars of Barcelona's pre-season, scoring in both the defeat to Arsenal and the thoroughly impressive 3-0 win over El Clasico rivals Real Madrid on Saturday night in Dallas, Texas.  feed In his press conference after that win, manager Xavi was quizzed by the press about Dembele's future:  ""We will see, in the transfer window you never know. ""I see Ousmane as happy at Barca. If thereâs something [in the PSG links] he will tell us. For now heâs here and heâs happy."" As well as discussing potential outgoings, Xavi also stressed the need for Barcelona to strengthen their squad this summer too, saying: ""I think are lacking [a few players]. We have to strengthen ourselves a little more. The president and the sports management know it. To be competitive we have to strengthen ourselves. ""I believe a lot in this team, but I think we need something more. My pending task as a coach is to compete more there. We don't hide. It's one of the objectives of the season."""
Rasmus Hojlund potential shirt numbers at Man Utd,"Jul 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/rasmus-hojlund-potential-shirt-numbers-at-man-utd,"Manchester United are close to making Rasmus Hojlund their third signing of the summer transfer window after a breakthrough in talks with Atalanta over the transfer fee. Hojlund only joined Atalanta last summer, but the 20-year-old has shown enough long-term potential with his 10 goals in 34 appearances - all the while sharing minutes with more senior players - to convince United to part with a guaranteed Â£64m (â¬75m). Another Â£8.5m (â¬10m) is in add-ons. Atalanta had earlier rejected three offers from United, the most recent reaching Â£50m. But personal terms over a proposed five-year contract had already been agreed with Hojlund and a move to Old Trafford has long been the player's desired outcome this summer. Hojlund was not involved as Atalanta faced Bournemouth in a pre-season friendly on Saturday, while the Bergamo side have already secured his replacement in the shape of El Bilal Toure from Almeria. Erik ten Hag is known for his ability to develop and nurture young talent from his years at Ajax and United have been crying out for a new central striker ever since Edinson Cavani and Cristiano Ronaldo left the club within a few months of each other. Hojlund, although raw, comes in at potentially just half the price of a more established goalscorer like Harry Kane or Victor Osimhen. As long as there are no unexpected hitches, Hojlund will soon join Mason Mount and Andre Onana in making the switch to Manchester United this summer. feed Hojlund has no real fixed attachment to a particular shirt number, largely because his fledgling career has already seen him move around quite a bit. The youngster initially broke into the first-team at FC Copenhagen in 2020 wearing 45, which is often associated with strikers because 4+5+9. He then traded that for 28 the following season. Hojlund's time at Sturm Graz in Austria saw him wear 9, while he took 17 upon joining Atalanta. He had previously worn both 9 and 17 in the Copenhagen youth ranks. For Denmark, Hojlund has started to establish himself as number 11. He has also worn 20 and 21 for the national team since making his senior debut last year. Available Manchester United shirt numbers at first-team level are relatively few and far between as things stand. Other than 1 and 4, which aren't really striker-appropriate, the only jerseys under under 30 currently available are 13 and 15. But several others could become available before the Premier League deadline locks squad numbers in, depending on how transfer business goes. 90min reported last week that United are making progress in talks with regard to selling Fred to Galatasaray. If he leaves, that frees up 17. Unable to stay consistently fit, Anthony Martial's future has remained up in the air, while the club is also yet to make a decision about Mason Greenwood. Should either or both leave, 9 and 11 could become available for Hojlund. But it would have to be sooner rather than later."
Allan Saint-Maximin leaves Newcastle to join Al Ahli,"Jul 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/allan-saint-maximin-leaves-newcastle-to-join-al-ahli,"Newcastle United have confirmed the departure of French winger Allan Saint-Maximin, who has completed his move to Saudi Arabian side Al Ahli.

Man Utd agree fee with Atalanta for Rasmus Hojlund,"Jul 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-agree-fee-atalanta-rasmus-hojlund,"Manchester United have agreed a fee with Atalanta for the transfer of Denmark striker Rasmus Hojlund, 90min understands. The Red Devils' striker search this summer led them to the former Sturm Graz forward, who scored nine goals in 32 Serie A appearances last season. United's most recent offer was rebuffed by Atalanta before Paris Saint-Germain entered the bidding with a rival proposal for the 20-year-old. 90min now understands the final package from United is worth â¬85m, â¬10m of are in potential add-ons. Personal terms were agreed between the two parties earlier in July. It's a five-year deal and United hope to conclude the deal quickly so he can take part in their pre-season. Hojlund was not involved in Atalanta's friendly with Bournemouth on Saturday, but the signing of his replacement - Almeria's El Bilal Toure - has been announced by the Italian side. Should all go to plan, Denmark international Hojlund will become United's third main summer arrival following incoming deals for midfielder Mason Mount and goalkeeper Andre Onana. Star forward Marcus Rashford has also signed a new deal at Old Trafford. feed Hojlund previously indicated his desire to leave Atalanta for United and personal terms were not an issue. However, a sticking point in negotiations was the up-front fee and how much would be paid in 2024. The Red Devils had previously pitched the idea of offering players in exchange, but Atalanta weren't interested. Arsenal and Chelsea were among the clubs previously interested in Hojlund, having scouts present for the striker's Denmark debut. United among other clubs were then informed he would cost around â¬70m, with Harry Kane and Victor Osimhen among their former targets. United's struggles up front were evident in 2022/23 despite their Carabao Cup success and Champions League qualification. Wout Weghorst was signed on a stop-gap loan while Rashford and Anthony Martial - fitness permitting - also featured in the central role. Rashford was United's top scorer in the Premier League in 2022/23, netting 17 goals. He struck 30 times in all competitions in total."
Barcelona confirm Nico sale to Porto with buy-back clause,"Jul 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-confirm-nico-sale-porto-buy-back-clause,"Barcelona midfielder Nico Gonzalez has completed a transfer to Portuguese giants Porto. Spain Under-21 international Nico made his Barca debut in 2021 under Ronald Koeman, having renewed his contract that year until 2024 with a whopping â¬500m release clause. His deal at Camp Nou was then extended to 2026 before departing for a loan spell with Valencia. Things went poorly at the Mestalla as Los Che narrowly avoided relegation in 2022/23, with Nico scoring once in 26 La Liga appearances. feed Barca have now announced his permanent â¬8.5m departure to Porto, who finished second in the Primeira Liga, and have a buy-back clause should they wish to bring the midfielder back to Camp Nou. The La Liga giants also retain a percentage of any future transfer fee for Nico. New summer arrivals Ilkay Gundogan and Oriol Romeu made Nico's pathway to starting XI football more difficult under Xavi, who already had the likes of Pedri, Gavi, Frenkie de Jong, Sergi Roberto and Franck Kessie to choose from in midfield. He is the latest Barca player to leave this window following the previous exits of Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba, Samuel Umtiti and Alex Collado. Alongside Gundogan and Romeu, the reigning Spanish champions have also brought in Inigo Martinez on a free transfer from Athletic Club and signed Brazilian forward Vitor Roque to come into effect in 2024/25. They are hopeful of completing more business before the window closes, too. Barca have long been interested in Manchester City's Bernado Silva, though the treble winners are ready to stand firm to stop the Portugal international leaving following the recent departure of Riyad Mahrez to Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli."
Pep Guardiola sends warning to Premier League over Saudi spending spree,"Jul 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/pep-guardiola-warning-premier-league-saudi-spending-spree,"Pep Guardiola has warned the Premier League the money on offer in Saudi Arabia has 'changed the market' after losing winger Riyad Mahrez to Al Ahli. Mahrez is one of a growing number of huge stars who have followed Cristiano Ronaldo to the Middle East this summer, with the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) bankrolling the division's top four sides to try to create a new superpower. Having not expected to lose Mahrez this summer, Guardiola insisted City will not go looking for a direct replacement for the Algerian but acknowledged a different style of forward could arrive at the Etihad. ""We are not looking for a replacement of Riyad in terms of skill because every player is different,"" Guardiola said. ""We will see what happens with loan players and which players stay here. A few things are going to happen."" feed Guardiola went on to warn the rest of the Premier League that the Saudi Pro League's spending spree had dramatically altered the transfer market, leaving even the biggest English sides unable to keep hold of their top talents. ""Saudi Arabia has changed the market,"" he explained. ""A few months ago, when Cristiano was the only one to go, no one thought this many top, top players would play in the Saudi league. ""In the future there will be more and that's why clubs need to be aware of what is happening. Riyad got an incredible offer and that's why we could not say 'don't do it'."" City, having also lost captain Ilkay Gundogan to Barcelona this summer, are battling with Bayern Munich to keep hold of right-back Kyle Walker, who has received a significant offer from the Bundesliga champions."
Chelsea reach agreement to sign Rennes midfielder Lesley Ugochukwu,"Jul 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-reach-agreement-sign-rennes-midfielder-lesley-ugochukwu,"Chelsea have struck an agreement to sign 19-year-old Rennes midfielder Lesley Ugochukwu, 90min understands. The Blues are keen to bolster in midfield this summer and have focused their efforts on Brighton's Moises Caicedo, recently seeing a bid of Â£80m rejected for the Ecuador international. Caicedo sits at the top of a lengthy midfield shortlist which also includes targets who fit into Chelsea's model of buying high-potential youngsters for the future. Sources have confirmed Blues officials have moved to bring in one of those young stars by striking a deal for Ugochukwu. A fee of around Â£25m has been agreed with Rennes, who have now granted the teenager permission to undergo a medical. A final decision over Ugochukwu's immediate future has not yet been made, with Chelsea open to sending the 19-year-old on loan to new sister side Strasbourg for more senior experience. Chelsea also hope to use Strasbourg to finalise a deal for Dynamo Moscow midfielder Arsen Zakharyan, while Montpellier striker Elye Wahi could also be loaned to the French side if a deal can be reached. feed Ugochukwu has spent the majority of his senior career playing at the base of Rennes' midfield, with the towering youngster racking up 60 appearances for Les Rouge et Noirs since his debut in April 2021. Before that debut, Ugochukwu was on the bench for Rennes when they travelled to Stamford Bridge to face Chelsea in the Champions League group stage in the 2020/21 season. ""I went to Chelsea and I saw Stamford Bridge,"" Ugochukwu recently recalled to The Athletic. ""When you go from being a kid seeing it on the TV and then being there, you're like 'Wow!'.""

8 players whose clubs would benefit from a Saudi Pro League sale,"Jul 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/8-players-whose-clubs-would-benefit-from-saudi-pro-league-sale,"The Saudi Pro League has been the major headline maker during the 2023 summer transfer window, with huge wages being offered to a number of stars to ditch European football and be part of something new in the Middle East. Whilst there is a fear among fans and clubs that any player can have their mouth stuffed with gold, there are certain situations where the Saudi Pro League is doing European clubs a big favour. Premier League clubs in particular find it very hard to identify buyers for unwanted players boasting wages or a perceived transfer value that many European clubs cannot afford. For this reason, there are some players around Europe right now who might be hoping that a Saudi Pro League club comes in for them, and some clubs who may, deep down, be thinking the same thing. manual AC Milan have been incredibly busy this summer in the transfer market with Marco Sportiello and Luka Romero snagged on free transfers along with Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Christian Pulisic, Tijjani Reijnders and Samuel Chukwueze for a total spend of around Â£78m - more than any other club in the division. Those purchases have been partially funded by Sandro Tonali's sale but more departures are needed. Two players at the top of the list of expendables are Divock Origi and Ante Rebic. The two forwards offered little last season and were left out of the US tour squad. Milan want transfer fees for them. Besiktas have been very interested in Rebic but want to loan him with an option to buy, while Milan are pushing for a full sale. Saudi Arabian clubs can offer that and interest in Rebic from the Middle East already exists. As for Origi, the Premier League may be a more realistic option but he has the hallmarks of a player that may end up in Saudi Arabia. Chelsea have had a lot of involvement with Saudi Pro League clubs this summer as N'Golo Kante, Edouard Mendy and Kalidou Koulibaly have headed in that direction. They have also been very keen for Hakim Ziyech to do the same. The Moroccan had seemed destined for Al Nassr but the move fell through. He has wanted to leave Chelsea for a while now and the club certainly don't need him given the number of wide players they have. As for Romelu Lukaku, Chelsea would like to sell him as soon as possible to bring the whole affair to a close. There was an offer from Saudi Arabia earlier in the window but Lukaku is determined to remain in Europe. Unless a move to Juventus starts to get off of the ground, he could be left with the choice of Saudi Arabia or the reserves at Chelsea. Hugo Lloris has already announced his intention to leave Tottenham this summer and the club are not going to stand in his way. There are a number of potential options available to the Frenchman and at 36 years old, few would begrudge him pursuing a payday in Saudi Arabia. That would lead to a clean break for Spurs, but there is European interest in Lloris too. Inter need two goalkeepers and Lloris is a contender to become the number one. Manchester United have been traditionally bad at selling players. Many stay for far too long on contracts that are far too big for any other club to match. Given both Fred and Harry Maguire are now deemed as surplus to requirements, especially if other signings arrive, they are in danger of heading down that same road. The potential signing of Sofyan Amrabat would speed up Fred's exit, with Galatasaray and Saudi Arabian clubs showing interest. Fred would command a big wage in the Middle East and at 30 he is young enough to potentially return to a decent level in Europe.  Unless a new defender arrives, there is a good chance that Maguire will stay at United as a squad option. He wants to play football, though, and he may choose to take himself out of the spotlight and spend a couple of seasons in Saudi Arabia if an offer arrives. Although, that exit could compromise his involvement for England. It would be a shame for Paul Pogba's second spell at Juventus to end like this, but he is the best-paid player in the squad and they will not find anyone to match those wages in Europe. Injuries have ravaged Pogba's return to the Bianconeri and there is serious talk of Juve just cutting their losses. The general belief seems to be that Pogba wants to stay at Juventus and fight for his place and his fitness next season, but should Juventus tell him that it is time to go, Saudi Arabia may be the only place he can go that wouldn't involve a pay cut. The PIF-backed duo of Al Ahli and Al Ittihad are both interested."
Brentford hold firm on David Raya asking price in Bayern Munich talks,"Jul 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/brentford-hold-firm-david-raya-asking-price-bayern-munich-talks,"Bayern Munich have held talks with Brentford over signing goalkeeper David Raya, 90min understands. The German giants are set to part ways with Yann Sommer this summer and are on the lookout for a new high-level stopper to cover for the injured Manuel Neuer, who has not played since breaking his leg during a holiday after the World Cup. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Raya has emerged on Bayern's radar and talks have been held with Brentford, but the Bees remain adamant that they will only do business if their asking price of Â£40m is met. Raya is in the final year of his contract at the Brentford Community Stadium and has previously admitted concerns over his asking price, which proved problematic in talks with Tottenham earlier this summer. Spurs did not want to pay Â£40m and ended up turning their attention to Guglielmo Vicario, eventually signing the stopper from Empoli for less than half that figure. feed The same fee has been put to Bayern, who are considering their next move in a summer which has already seen Kim Min-jae, Raphael Guerreiro and Konrad Laimer make the move to the Allianz Arena. Bayern brought in Sommer in January after learning of Neuer's injury and the Swiss international helped lead the team to yet another Bundesliga title, but the 34-year-old is now expected to leave just six months later. Inter are known to be keen as they seek to replace Andre Onana, who has joined Manchester United. Sommer has a release clause in his Bayern contract and the club's honourary president, Uli Hoeness, recently confirmed they would not stand in the goalkeeper's way if he chooses to leave. ""He has a clause that he could leave if he wanted to,"" Hoeness revealed earlier this month. ""We have opened talks with him, we told him so. We will consider each other's perspectives."""
Serie A side respond to links to Man Utd midfielder,"Jul 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/serie-a-side-respond-links-man-utd-midfielder,"Lazio president Claudio Lotito has confirmed the club will not be making a move for Manchester United midfielder Fred at the request of manager Maurizio Sarri. Lazio have lost Sergej Milinkovic-Savic to Al Hilal this summer and are on the hunt for potential reinforcements, and reports in Italy have named Lazio as potential suitors for Fred as he inches towards the exit door at Old Trafford. While Lotito was willing to make a move for Fred, he has now revealed that the plan was blocked by Sarri himself. ""I was prepared to open talks with Man Utd and bid for Fred, but Maurizio Sarri told me no - he doesnât want Fred,"" Lotito told Il Messaggero. ""He did the same with [Tottenham midfielder Giovani] Lo Celso. Sarri wants [Piotr] Zielinski and [Samuele] Ricci."" feed United remain keen to offload Fred this summer and 90min understands progress has been made in talks with Turkish giants Galatasaray, who have already seen one bid knocked back for the 30-year-old midfielder. Scott McTominay is also facing an uncertain future at United after attracting interest from West Ham United. Mason Mount has already been signed to bolster Erik ten Hag's midfield and the Dutch boss is hopeful of making another addition, with Fiorentina's Sofyan Amrabat known to be high on his wish list. United are also interested in versatile Ajax star Mohammed Kudus, who played as a midfielder under Ten Hag in Amsterdam but impressed in a more attacking role last season."
Chelsea dismiss Romelu Lukaku loan enquiry from Juventus,"Jul 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-dismiss-romelu-lukaku-loan-enquiry-juventus,"Chelsea have knocked back an enquiry from Juventus over a loan deal for wantaway striker Romelu Lukaku, 90min understands. Lukaku has just returned from a loan spell with Inter and is set to leave Chelsea in the coming weeks after being left out of Mauricio Pochettino's squad for the pre-season tour of the United States. Inter had been leading the charge for his signature but shockingly abandoned their lengthy pursuit of the striker amid suspicions that he had been negotiating with Juventus, despite Lukaku claiming both privately and publicly that he would never entertain a move to another Italian side. Former Inter teammate Lautaro Martinez recently admitted he was 'disappointed' with Lukaku's behaviour this summer. Juventus are interested in signing Lukaku and have reached out to Chelsea over a possible loan deal, and while the Blues are welcoming discussions about the Belgian, they are not currently entertaining a temporary deal. feed Chelsea want to sell Lukaku permanently and continue to push for an agreement that would see them part ways with the 30-year-old and his high wages altogether. Sources close to Chelsea believe that the Blues would accept a loan offer if it included a mandatory purchase clause, with the plan currently to find a solution which would definitively bring an end to Lukaku's second spell at Stamford Bridge. An offer remains on the table from Saudi Arabia. Lukaku snubbed a transfer to the Middle East earlier this summer and is understood to be keen to remain in Europe, with a return to Italy his preferred move at this point. However, with limited interest in his services, all potential options are being explored and the approach from Saudi Arabia has not yet been completely rejected. Lukaku, who turned 30 in May, still has three years remaining on the contract he signed when he rejoined Chelsea from Inter for Â£97.5m in 2021."

Having fallen out of favour under Erik ten Hag during the 2022/23 season - a season in which the defender made just eight Premier League starts - Maguire was recently stripped of the Man Utd captaincy, with the armband being given to Bruno Fernandes in his stead.  90min recently reported that, after being stripped of the captain's armband, Erik ten Hag communicated to Maguire that it would be 'better for all involved' if he accepted a move away from Old Trafford during the summer transfer window. The defender has consistently reiterated his desire to stay at Old Trafford and fight to be part of Ten Hag's plans, however the club are hopeful that he will ultimately change his stance regarding his own future.  Tottenham Hotspur had been among the clubs said to be interested in signing the out-of-favour centre-back, and 90min understands that West Ham have also joined the race in recent weeks due to David Moyes identifying the player as an ideal defensive reinforcement.

McTominay is seen as a potential replacement for Declan Rice this summer, who left the club for Arsenal in a British record deal earlier in July.

PSG open talks with Barcelona over Ousmane Dembele,"Jul 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-talks-barcelona-ousmane-dembele,"Paris Saint-Germain have held talks with Barcelona over the signing of Ousmane Dembele, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 26-year-old became one of the most expensive players in the world back in 2017, moving to Camp Nou from Borussia Dortmund in a deal worth an initial Â£90m. But his six seasons in Spain have yielded just 127 appearances in La Liga - an average of just over 21 games per campaign - because of a numerous injury problems, and he's yet to score more than eight league goals in a single season. Barcelona claimed a convincing 2022/23 La Liga title win under the management of club legend Xavi, but Dembele was restricted to just 16 starts and found the back of the net just five times in the 25 appearances he made overall. Despite his inconsistency and struggles to stay fit, Barcelona have been talking to Dembele over extending the two-year contract he penned in July 2022, when he was strongly linked with a move away from the club.

A club-record bid is expected to arrive from Bayern imminently - one that will top the â¬80m (Â£68.4m at current conversion) paid to Atletico Madrid for Lucas Hernandez back in 2019. Kane's representatives are understood to have discussed personal terms with the Bundesliga champions, with a broad agreement over basics reached, but Bayern still face a real battle to convince Levy to sell. Kane has entered the final year of his contract, thus far showing little inclination to ink fresh terms. But Spurs remain confident that the 30-year-old, who has 213 Premier League goals to his name and is the club's record goalscorer, will commit his future to the club once more, leading the club into a new era under new head coach Ange Postecoglou."
Riyad Mahrez leaves Man City to join Al Ahli,"Jul 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/riyad-mahrez-leaves-man-city-al-ahli,"Manchester City have confirmed the departure of Riyad Mahrez, who has joined Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli. The winger joined from Leicester City in 2018 and went on to win four Premier League titles during a glittering spell at the Etihad Stadium, also getting his hands on the Champions League trophy as part of last season's treble. He leaves City having managed 236 appearances in all competitions, racking up 78 goals and 59 assists for Pep Guardiola's side. ""To play for Manchester City has been an honour and privilege,"" Mahrez told club media. ""I came to City to win trophies and enjoy my football and I achieved all that and so much more. ""I have had five unforgettable years with this football club, working with unbelievable players, fantastic supporters, and the best manager in the world. Iâve made a lifetime of wonderful memories and the manner of our Premier League title wins and the battles weâve had with Liverpool and, last year, Arsenal, underlined our collective desire and mentality to be the best. ""Manchester City will forever be a huge and happy part of my life."" feed Club director Txiki Begiristain added: ""Riyad has been a major factor in our amazing successes over the past five years and his contribution will not be forgotten. He is a wonderful footballer to watch and leaves us with so many great memories. ""There are few wingers that possess his levels of skill and technique in world football, and he will be missed, but everyone will wish him all the best as he begins a new chapter in his career."" 90min previously revealed that Mahrez was hurt by his omission from both the Champions League and FA Cup finals, having previously proven to Pep Guardiola his worth in big games. Instead, he had a watching brief as City went on to win both finals, winning a famous treble after wrapping up the Premier League title ahead of Arsenal. Mahrez will link up with Edouard Mendy and Roberto Firmino at Al Ahli, with a move for Newcastle winger Allan Saint-Maximin also in the pipeline."
Arsenal continue pursuit of Brazilian talent identified by Edu,"Jul 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-continue-pursuit-brazil-talent-edu,"Arsenal are continuing to work on a deal for Bitello and are confident of securing his signature despite rival interest, sources have told 90min. The 23-year-old has just two years of first team football under his belt in Brazil, one of which was spent in Serie B, but has attracted the interest of a number of clubs from around Europe. 90min revealed earlier this month that Arsenal were among those interested in striking a deal with Gremio, and that representatives had been dispatched to South America to discuss a transfer. Negotiations are ongoing between the two clubs, with Gremio's asking price believed to be around the Â£8.5m (â¬10m; $10.8m) mark. Bitello is understood to be eager to move continents, and Arsenal are confident they are at the head of the queue for a player who has been picked out by their sporting director Edu, thanks to his sources in his homeland. feed However, sources have also confirmed to 90min that Arsenal are not the only club who have made an approach for Bitello in recent weeks, with Monaco, Porto and Zenit St Petersburg all holding conversations about the verstile midfielder. Indeed, a number of clubs were represented at Gremio's Copa do Brasil semi-final clash with Flamengo on Thursday, keeping a close eye on Bitelli's performance. Gremio president Alberto Guerra confirmed earlier this month that there was interest in Bitello but insisted in regards to an offer being made: âThere are a lot of people watching Bitello, but a proposal, even to reassure our fans, there is none at the moment"". Arsenal have enjoyed themselves in the summer transfer market, strengthening Mikel Arteta's squad with a trio of big-money signings. Jurrien Timber, Kai Havertz and Declan Rice have signed on the dotted line, the latter for a British-record Â£105m fee, though there's expected to be a number of departures from the Emirates Stadium before the British window closes on September 1."
Ajax director confirms interest in Mohammed Kudus & Edson Alvarez,"Aug 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ajax-director-confirms-interest-mohammed-kudus-edson-alvarez,"Ajax sporting director Sven Mislintat has confirmed that they have received enquiries over versatile midfielder Mohammed Kudus. 90min reported earlier in the week that Chelsea had reached out to Kudus' representatives to strike an agreement over personal terms, while Arsenal, Manchester United and Brighton also retain interest in the 22-year-old. ""There are clubs that have informally enquired about him,"" Mislintat told Ajax Life. ""I donât expect an offer very soon, although you know that things can be different in the football world. Perhaps the interest in not as serious as everyone thinks."" feed In a separate interview with Aglemeen Dagblad, Mislintat acknowledged that Ajax could lose both Kudus and West Ham target Edson Alvarez, but warned suitors that the Dutch outfit will not sell without first finding a replacement. ""There is no fixed deadline, but there are agreements we must have to get replacements if we have not already done so proactively,"" he explained. ""Their stay or sale also depends on what we will do next. ""The best thing for is if Kudus and Alvarez stay, then we keep two top players. But it is also possible that one goes, or both. ""It is important for us that the relationship with the players remains good. This can be done by being transparent and applying good principles. As we get closer to the deadline, the transfer fee, for example, goes up."""
Barcelona forward rules out summer transfer,"Jul 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-forward-rules-out-summer-transfer,"Barcelona winger Ferran Torres has vowed to stay and fight for his future at Camp Nou after a summer full of significant transfer speculation. Torres, a â¬55m signing from Manchester City in January 2022, has managed 14 goals in 71 games for the Blaugrana and actually played fewer La Liga minutes last season than during his first six months at the club, despite making 15 more appearances. Indeed, Torres started just 14 times for Xavi's side last season, with the likes of Raphinha and Ousmane Dembele well ahead in the pecking order. With Barcelona needing to raise money this summer, Torres has been touted as a likely casualty but, as 90min reported last month, the 23-year-old is not interested in a move away. ""The rumours are put there by journalists. I have a contract here, I'm going to stay,"" Torres told the media. feed ""I have it clear in my head, I am qualified to play for BarÃ§a. What is said about me doesn't matter to me. I have to be calm with myself and work as hard as possible because, in the end, the reward always arrives."" Torres did, however, acknowledge the need to improve after an underwhelming individual campaign. ""I am my first critic,"" he confessed. ""Last season was not good but it is one of the ones I have learned the most from in my career. Those ups and downs I had are helping me to be stronger now."" One potential avenue for more minutes would be a move to a central striker to offer cover for 34-year-old Robert Lewandowski who, until Vitor Roque arrives next year, is the only natural in the position in Xavi's squad. ""The more versatility I have, the more options there are to play,"" Torres added. ""I can play on both wings, forward or second striker. It's good for me and for the team."""

Brighton make quick decision over improved Chelsea offer for Moises Caicedo,"Jul 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/brighton-quick-decision-improved-chelsea-offer-moises-caicedo,"Brighton & Hove Albion have rejected an improved Chelsea offer for midfielder Moises Caicedo, sources have confirmed to 90min. Brighton rebuffed an offer from Chelsea worth Â£70m earlier in the month and, despite a Â£10m increase to Â£80m - including add-ons, the outcome is still the same. Sources close to Brighton have indicated that the offer was rejected almost as soon as it arrived, with the Seagulls showing no sign of budging from their Â£100m valuation of Caicedo. The Ecuador international, who signed a new contract with Brighton after seeing a January transfer to Arsenal fail to materialise, has indicated to his clubs that he would like the chance to move. But he also still understands that they won't sell until their valuation is met. feed Chelsea have long considered Caicedo their top transfer target in the summer market, but will have to return with another improved bid to make their ambition a reality and it is expected that they will. Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi remains committed to using Caicedo whilst he still can and the 21-year-old remains a key part of the squad for at least the time being. ""Iâm happy if Moises stays and plays with us. We will play anyway without him. We have to be ready to find another midfielder if Caicedo leaves,"" said De Zerbi from America, where Brighton are on a pre-season tour. De Zerbi admitted earlier in the week that club owner Tony Bloom had assured him that Caicedo would not be sold unless their demands were fully met and said: ""I spoke with Tony Bloom and he told me if the conditions donât change, Moises stays with us."""
Atalanta agree transfer for Rasmus Hojlund replacement wanted by Everton,"Jul 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/atalanta-agree-transfer-rasmus-hojlund-replacement-man-utd-everton,"Atalanta have secured a deal to sign striker El Bilal Toure from Almeria, with the 21-year-old set to arrive in Bergamo as a replacement for Manchester United target Rasmus Hojlund. United have had two previous offers rejected for Hojlund so far this summer but put in a bid worth Â£51.4m, including add-ons, on Wednesday for the 20-year-old Dane. Paris Saint-Germain have since made a rival verbal bid for a lesser amount, totalling Â£42.9m, with Atalanta are holding out for Â£60m. Hojlund has already indicated to Atalanta that he wants the opportunity to join United, with the playerâs camp also making the Old Trafford club aware of that. feed The Serie A club appear to at least be planning for life without him as only a medical now stands between Toure and a completed transfer. 90min understands that everything is agreed over a â¬31m (Â£26.6m) transfer that includes add-ons. The medical is due in the next 48 hours. Everton had also been interested in Toure, an Ivory Coast international, but the Toffees were unable to raise the funds to make an acceptable offer of their own. Toure only joined Almeria last summer and went on to score the winning goal against eventual La Liga champions Barcelona in February â the clubâs first ever win over the Catalan giants. He had first arrived in Europe from Africa in January 2020, spending two and a half years with Reims. Toureâs imminent transfer to Atalanta will be viewed positively in the red half of Manchester."
When does the transfer window close? 2023 summer deadline day date,"Jul 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/when-does-transfer-window-close-2023-summer-deadline-day-date,"The 2023 summer transfer window is in full swing and big moves are happening almost every day. Arguably the major theme of the window has been prominent players choosing to go and play in the Saudi Pro League, rather than remain in Europe. Every single transfer window in recent years has left us wondering how things can get any more dramatic, confusing and ridiculous, and 2023 certainly isn't looking to be any different. With the domestic leagues in Europe coming back much sooner than you might realise, some clubs will be getting concerned about a lack of business. That is when things can get really dramatic. The closer we get to the end of the transfer window, the weirder the deals become. Clubs realise they simply have to get a striker through the door, and they will pay what is needed even for a player they previously had little to no interest in. Think of Odion Ighalo or Wout Weghorst's spells at Manchester United.  manual Having opened on June 14, the summer transfer window for Premier League teams is going to slam shut on September 1, at 23:00 BST. That means that most teams will play around three league games before the window closes, providing further info as to whether new players are needed. The window will close at the same time in the EFL, but there will be some variation around the major leagues in Europe. Serie A, La Liga, the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 all shut on September 1, but the times are not the same for everyone which always causes an added layer of panic for clubs. The Dutch Eredivisie shuts on August 31, while Turkish and Portuguese clubs will be buying players up until September 15 and 22 respectively - opening up the possibility of sales without the ability to replace. Perhaps more importantly, the Saudi Pro League transfer window is open until September 20. *All times BST. League Date window closes Premier League September 1, 23:00 EFL  September 1, 23:00 La Liga September 1, 18:00 Serie A September 1, 19:00 Bundesliga  September 1, 17:00 Ligue 1 September 1, 22:00 Turkish Super Lig September 15 Dutch Eredivisie  September 22 Saudi Pro League September 20 While the Saudi Pro League may have been dominating the headlines with the likes of Kalidou Koulibaly, Roberto Firmino, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Karim Benzema heading there, the transfer fees have not been huge. It is the wages that are really shocking people.  In terms of the biggest fees, Declan Rice's move to Arsenal from West Ham was a whopper, as was Jude Bellingham's move from Borussia Dortmund to Real Madrid. The likes of Kai Havertz, Andre Onana, Mason Mount, Dominik Szoboszlai and Christopher Nkunku have all been the subjects of major moves. If any move is going to top the below list, it would be Kylian Mbappe's proposed Â£259m switch to Al Hilal - though that's not a transfer he's currently interested in.

Lautaro Martinez 'disappointed' with Romelu Lukaku over Inter saga,"Jul 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/lautaro-martinez-disappointed-with-romelu-lukaku-over-inter-saga,"Inter striker Lautaro Martinez has admitted he was disappointed with Romelu Lukaku's conduct as the Nerazzurri tried to sign him from Chelsea. The two clubs had been locked in transfer talks for months and were finally nearing an agreement when Lukaku failed to return Inter's calls and was accused of holding talks with fierce rivals Juventus, despite having insisted he was only interested in a return to San Siro. Inter wasted little time in abandoning their pursuit of the Belgian and ending hopes of yet another reunion between Martinez and Lukaku, who were one of Europe's fiercest strike forces just a few years ago. The behaviour of Lukaku, who had publicly and privately insisted he would never entertain a move to another Italian side, also took a toll on Martinez, who spoke to La Gazzetta dello Sport about the whole saga. ""I was disappointed, itâs the truth,"" he said. ""I also tried to call him in those days of chaos, he never answered me, the same he did with my other teammates.  feed ""After so many years together, after so many things lived together, I was disappointed. Thankfully, itâs his choice. I wish him the best. But I didnât expect this attitude."" Lukaku was left out of Chelsea's pre-season squad as the Blues continue to try and drum up interest in the Belgian. Juventus are known admirers but must resolve the future of Dusan Vlahovic before considering a formal bid, while Lukaku has rebuffed interest from Saudi Arabia in the hope of landing a new club in Europe. Offers from the Middle East remain on the table but the final decision rests with Lukaku, who still has three years remaining on his Chelsea contract and is set to net the Blues an enormous loss on the Â£97.5m they paid to sign him just two years ago. A fee of Â£40m was quoted to Inter before the breakdown in talks."
Chelsea hatch Strasbourg plan for Arsen Zakharyan as Blues lodge Elye Wahi offer,"Jul 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-hatch-strasbourg-plan-for-arsen-zakharyan-elye-wahi-offer,"Chelsea's owners are keen to strike a deal to sign Dynamo Moscow midfielder Arsen Zakharyan for new partner club Strasbourg, 90min understands. 20-year-old Zakharyan first emerged as a target for Chelsea last summer but complications over dealing with a Russian club in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine ultimately rendered a deal impossible, and attempts to reignite negotiations in January also fell flat. Since then, a number of clubs have expressed an interest in Zakharyan, who is free to leave Dynamo Moscow this summer after entering the final 12 months of his contract. Feyenoord and Lazio are both understood to have reached out, forcing Chelsea to explore their options to recruit the Russia international. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea's owners, who also control a majority stake in Ligue 1 side Strasbourg, are now hoping to strike a deal which would see the French side sign Zakharyan this summer instead. A fee of just Â£8.6m is expected to be enough to get a deal over the line, with a number of European sides sensing the chance to strike a bargain. feed Elsewhere, Chelsea have lodged a verbal offer of Â£21m for Montpellier striker Elye Wahi, who the Blues hope to loan to Strasbourg for the coming campaign. 20-year-old Wahi racked up 19 goals and six assists in Ligue 1 last season and, like Zakharyan, has plenty of suitors from across Europe, and so Chelsea are trying to move early to win the race for his signature. Montpellier value Wahi at closer to Â£30m but talks between the two clubs are ongoing with a view to reaching a compromise. If Chelsea can agree a deal, they will offer Wahi the chance to spend next season on loan with Strasbourg, although the Blues are prepared to find the striker another temporary home if such a move does not appeal to Wahi. Chelsea's transfer strategy has already begun to take shape at Strasbourg, who have signed 20-year-olds Abakar Sylla and Emanuel Emegha for Â£17m and Â£11m respectively. The deals are the two most expensive in Strasbourg history."
Jurgen Klopp sends goodbye message to Jordan Henderson after Al Ettifaq transfer,"Jul 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jurgen-klopp-sends-goodbye-message-jordan-henderson-al-ettifaq-transfer,"Jurgen Klopp has admitted Liverpool will miss Jordan Henderson after the midfielder completed his transfer to Al Ettifaq.  Henderson ended his 12-year career at Anfield to reunite with fellow former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard at Saudi Pro League club Al Ettifaq, signing a three-year deal which will see him reportedly earn Â£700,000-per-week.  In an interview on Liverpool's official website, Liverpool manager Klopp addressed the club captain's exit, admitting the Reds will miss him heading into the 2023/24 campaign. ""Monday when we arrived back in Liverpool, Hendo was waiting for us to say goodbye properly to the team and to the coaching staff as well, so that was a really nice gesture - a really nice thing to do,"" Klopp revealed. ""I know it was a really, really tough decision for Hendo and I was around or with him all the way. It's sad, absolutely strange, because he is the only captain I had here at Liverpool, but I think it is exciting for him as well.  ""We will miss him, without a shadow of a doubt, that's clear - as a man and as a player. But, as I said, that's football."" feed Klopp also discussed the legacy Henderson will leave at Liverpool, having captained the side to both a Premier League and UEFA Champions League triumph. ""In the future when people are looking back then they will realise Jordan Henderson was the skipper of [our] most successful squad until then - I hope we can create another one - and the skipper of the first Premier League title winners and all these kind of things,"" Klopp explained. ""That's a special career. He should be and will be in the future proud of it."" 90min understands that Liverpool are currently in the market to find a replacement for Henderson, and are preparing a second bid for Romeo Lavia in the coming days having seen an initial bid be rejected by the midfielder's current club Southampton.

Man Utd continue Sofyan Amrabat talks and work on midfielder exit,"Jul 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-sofyan-amrabat-talks-midfielder-exit,"Manchester United are continuing to hold talks with Fiorentina over Sofyan Amrabat while they work on moving Fred out of the club, 90min understands. The Red Devils slipped to a 2-0 defeat to Real Madrid in their latest pre-season friendly in Houston, where it was apparent that Erik ten Hag's side are in desperate need of a new striker. Ten Hag admitted as much after the game, revealing the club are ""working 24/7"" on addressing the issue, and United's current priority is finalising the capture of Atalanta striker Rasmus Hojlund, whom they made a Â£51.4m bid for on Wednesday. PSG are also interested in the highly-rated Dane, but Ten Hag has stressed the importance of United completing their transfer business before the new Premier League season begins. Crucially, Hojlund's preference is to head to Old Trafford. 90min confirmed earlier this month that United were also looking to address some issues in central midfield, and had opened talks with Fiorentina over Amrabat, who helped his club reach the final of last season's Europa Conference League and was a standout player for Morocco at the 2022 World Cup. feed Those talks are continuing to be held, 90min understands, although United do not have a clear run at Amrabat's signature. La Liga heavyweights Atletico Madrid are also interested in signing a new defensive midfielder and have him on a three-player shortlist of targets alongside Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Marco Verratti - though the latter now seems destined to join Al Hilai in Saudi Arabia.  Indeed, Spanish sources believe they are a very real threat to United's pursuit of Amrabat. United are also working hard on moving on some of their squad players, and progress is being made in regards to selling Fred to Turkish giants Galatasaray. The Brazilian's departure would free up valuable room on United's wage bill, and after an opening bid from Gala was turned down, negotiations are ongoing between the two parties. Sources have told 90min there's a confidence of that deal eventually being agreed, which is a key factor in United progressing their move for Amrabat. United have already signed Mason Mount and Andre Onana in big-money deals this summer - moves made to strengthen United's squad ahead of a return to the Champions League."
Jordan Henderson completes move to Al Ettifaq,"Jul 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jordan-henderson-completes-move-al-ettifaq,"Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson has completed his move to Saudi Pro League side Al Ettifaq. The England international has reunited with Reds legend Steven Gerrard, who recently decided to take up Al Ettifaq's offer to become their new manager. 90min first revealed at the start of July that Gerrard wanted to bring in former teammate Henderson as one of his first signings. And Henderson has now put pen to paper on a contract with Al Ettifaq, bringing an end to his 12-year stay at Anfield. The midfielder posted a lengthy farewell message to fans on Wednesday and received his own parting statement from Liverpool, who wished their former captain well after he helped inspire one of the club's most successful periods. manual ""As his Anfield chapter now comes to a close with a move to Al Ettifaq in Saudi Arabia, everybody at Liverpool Football Club wishes to place on record their thanks and gratitude for everything Jordan Henderson did for the club during his 12 years as a Red,"" the club's long statement ended. Henderson signed for Liverpool in 2011 from Sunderland, though struggled to make much of a good impression during his first few seasons on Merseyside. He emerged as one of their key players under Brendan Rodgers during the 2013/14 season in which they just missed out on the Premier League title, and he was handed the captain's armband following Gerrard's departure in 2015. Henderson leaves Liverpool having won eight trophies - including seven as captain - and having made 492 appearances for the club, scoring 33 goals."
PSG lodge bid to rival Man Utd for Atalanta's Rasmus Hojlund,"Jul 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-bid-rival-man-utd-rasmus-hojlund,"Paris Saint-Germain have submitted a bid worth Â£42.9m for Manchester United transfer target Rasmus Hojlund, 90min understands. United, who Erik ten Hag says are ""working 24/7"" to sign a striker, have settled on the 20-year-old Dane as their top target this summer and made a higher offer than PSG's on Wednesday, worth Â£51.4m inclusive of add-ons. Hojlund has already indicated to Atalanta that he wants the opportunity to join United, and that stance has been reaffirmed by his camp to the Red Devils - they are his first choice destination and he hopes a fee will be agreed. PSG's interest stems from their need to plan for life without Kylian Mbappe. The Frenchman is on the shopping list of Saudi Pro League moneybags Al Hilal, and they have even had a world record Â£259m offer accepted. The 24-year-old is not interested in negotiating terms though, and instead wants to join Real Madrid. Sources have confirmed to 90min that PSG's opening offer for Hojlund is a verbal one worth â¬50m in local currency, but it is unlikely to be accepted as Atalanta have already indicated that at least â¬70m will be requited to part ways this summer. feed Club officials have even publicly valued Hojlund at â¬100m, though there's a realisation that neither United or PSG, or any other club for that matter, would be prepared to pay that amount. It's also unclear whether or not PSG will look to further their interest in Hojlund if Atalanta knock their bid back, as they are also known to be pursuing Benfica striker Goncalo Ramos. Luis Enrique's first summer in the French capital has already been a busy one, with turnover high at PSG both in terms of incomings and outgoings. Milan Skriniar, Marco Asensio, Manuel Ugarte, Lee Kang-in and Lucas Hernandez are five high-profile players to have arrived at the club this summer, compensating for the exits of Lionel Messi and Sergio Ramos among others."
Liverpool to make improved offer worth Â£45m for Romeo Lavia,"Jul 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-to-make-improved-offer-45m-romeo-lavia,"Liverpool are ready to return with a second offer worth Â£45m for Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia, 90min understands. Jurgen Klopp's midfield is undergoing a significant revamp after last season's disappointment of missing out on the Champions League, with Naby Keita, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and James Milner already out of the exit door. Fabinho and Jordan Henderson are to follow, with deals to Saudi Pro League sides Al Ittihad and Al Ettifaq working towards completion. There had been doubts over whether Fabinho's switch to Saudi Arabia would go through, with Liverpool struggling to agree the specifics of the Â£40m deal, but work is continuing to make that deal happen. Henderson, meanwhile, has already begun training with his new side and posted a farewell message to Liverpool's supporters on Wednesday. 90min previously revealed that an opening offer for Lavia, comprising of Â£35m plus add-ons, had been rejected by Southampton, with the recently-relegated side looking to pocket a fee of at least Â£50m for the talented teenager. Arsenal and Chelsea have also shown interest in Lavia this summer, while Manchester City have a buy-back clause - inserted in the deal that saw the Belgian join Southampton - that becomes active next summer. feed But Liverpool want to ensure Lavia moves to Anfield and not anywhere else, with sources confirming to 90min that a second bid is expected to imminently land in the St Mary's in tray. The proposal will be worth Â£45m to Southampton overall, comprised of Â£40m in guaranteed money plus an additional Â£5m in add-ons - an amount that still falls short of the Championship side's valuation. Lavia's camp have already indicated their desire to make the move, and 90min understands that personal terms have already been agreed in principle. The hope from Liverpool's end is that a deal can be agreed in time for him to be a part of their pre-season tour to Singapore, which comes to an end next Wednesday. Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai have arrived to help fill the void in midfield, but Klopp's number one priority is to find a new defensive-minded player of holding things together in the middle of the park."
Erik ten Hag: Man Utd working 24/7 to sign a new striker,"Jul 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/erik-ten-hag-man-utd-working-24-7-to-sign-a-new-striker,"Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag says the club are working around the clock to bring in a new striker. The Red Devils' need for additional firepower was laid bare during Wednesday night's 2-0 defeat to Real Madrid at the NRG Stadium in Houston - a game that saw Jude Bellingham get on the scoresheet for the first time since his big-money move from Borussia Dortmund. Marcus Rashford started the game as United's central striker, away from his preferred position out on the left, and he struggled to make an impression as Madrid came away with a well-deserved clean sheet. 90min revealed on Wednesday that United have made an offer worth Â£51.4m for Atalanta striker Rasmus Hojlund, with the Dane identified as Ten Hag's primary target after months and months of scouting. Atalanta are expected to turn the bid down, as they push for an initial fee closer to Â£60m, but Ten Hag admitted in his post-match interview the need for United to bring a fresh face in through the door, and quickly. ""We are working 24-7,"" the Dutchman said of the situation. ""We do and everyone, well not everyone, but a lot in the club, and we give all the power to get this done. We never talk about players under contract with another club, so we have our targets in the background. We are busy with it to get the right player to sign a contract for us."" feed Ten Hag also touched on the nature of Kobbie Mainoo's injury, after he hobbled off in the early stages of the game after being on the receiving end of a crunching Rodrygo tackle. The 18-year-old was pictured wearing a protective boot after the game, but the manager said it was too early to determine the severity of the problem. ""I understand the question,"" Ten Hag said, when asked about his condition. ""But you can never tell straight after a game. We have to wait for what it is. ""So, hopefully, it's not too bad and then chances will come. I wanted to see what levels he could play. Against Arsenal, we were pleased with his performance. I wanted to see if he could repeat that, some days after, from then, we would have conclusions. First, we have to wait for the diagnosis and, from there on, we will set conclusions."" Ten Hag also commented on Andre Onana's debut performance in goal. The former Inter stopper was a late arrival to United's pre-season tour of the United States, but was handed his first opportunity to impress against a side more than capable of keeping him busy. On the whole, Ten Hag was impressed with what he saw from Onana, telling the assembled media:  ""When you play against Real Madrid, you will concede chances because it is a very good team with very good football players. But, overall, we did quite well and in the moment we conceded chances, he was there. I think everyone has seen, he has made a good debut. ""We have a lot of work to do betweenÂ him and and the defending part. You could see the second goal where we are not closing the back post, it can't be that and a goal will come there and that's things that are the rules we have to follow. It will come quickly that we integrate that into our way of play."""

Kylian Mbappe makes his decision over Al Hilal negotiations,"Jul 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/kylian-mbappe-makes-decision-al-hilal-negotiations,"Kylian Mbappe is not interested in meeting representatives from Al Hilal, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Saudi Pro League side had a world record â¬300m (Â£259m) offer accepted by PSG on Monday, with the Ligue 1 giants keen to move Mbappe on to avoid losing him on a free transfer next summer. Mbappe has already indicated that he will not exercise the 12-month option in his PSG contract, leaving the club no choice but to try and engineer a transfer for the 24-year-old before the 1 September transfer deadline. PSG had made the 2022 World Cup Golden Boot winner available for â¬200m (Â£171m), hoping long-term admirers Real Madrid would come forward with an offer. But 90min revealed on Monday that it was PIF-backed Al Hilal who had lodged an astronomical bid far above that asking price. Yet doubts quickly emerged over whether Mbappe would be interested in negotiating with Al Hilal, given his long-held affection for Real Madrid, as well as his positive relationship with president Florentino Perez. Sources have now confirmed to 90min that Mbappe and his mother, who is also his agent, have informed a delegation from Al Hilal that they have no interest in discussing personal terms - despite the Saudi club's willingness to make him one of the highest-paid athletes in the world - and have 'zero interest' in leaving Europe at this time. manual Indeed, Mbappe plans to play at the highest level for as many years as he can, which would seemingly rule out a move to the Middle East for the foreseeable future. Whether or not he ends up playing in Saudi Arabia late on in his career remains to be seen, but for now he intends to establish his legacy at a more competitive level. Real Madrid have kept their counsel to this point, unflustered by Al Hilal's approach for Mbappe, though they could still look to tempt PSG to sell this summer for a reduced price. If they decide to wait, the 14-time Champions League winners know they can agree to sign Mbappe on a pre-contract agreement in January, or haggle his price down further when just six months will be left on his PSG deal. PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi is keen to avoid that situation at all costs, with intermediaries instructed to drum up interest in Mbappe from the rest of European football's top brass. But given the finances involved in the deal, coupled with the player's particular desire to head to Madrid, any bid from an interested party may prove futile. While Mbappe is not planning to head to Saudi Arabia, the same can't be said for his PSG team-mate, Marco Verratti. 90min understands that Al Hilal are on the verge of luring the Italian midfielder to Riyadh, where a lucrative three-year contract is on the table. If Verratti joins, as is now expected, he'll line up alongside Ruben Neves and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic in a formidable-looking midfield three. Al Hilal have additionally already signed Kalidou Koulibaly from Chelsea to strengthen their backline."
Al Hilal  close to deal for PSG superstar,"Jul 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/al-hilal-close-deal-psg-superstar-marco-verratti,"Al Hilal are close to agreeing a deal with Paris Saint-Germain for veteran Italian midfield star Marco Verratti, 90min understands. The Saudi Pro League club have been locked in talks with PSG about Kylian Mbappe this week and lodged a world record bid worth Â£259m. But it has now become clear that they were not only in talks about the French star, with an approach for Verratti also going in. Al Hilal are now close to agreeing a deal with PSG, having also offered a substantial three-year contract to the player to to lure him to Riyadh. feed  Al Hilal made their move after Verratti's agents made a number of clubs aware that he was considering his options this summer. Atletico Madrid were also interested, but they could not get near matching the terms on offer in the Middle East. Sources have told 90min that Verratti had developed a number of concerns about his PSG future. Among the issues were the treatment of teammates and good friends Neymar and Mbappe, playing a part in deciding the time has to move on from Parc des Princes. New PSG boss Luis Enrique is understood to be a huge fan of Verratti and wanted to keep him. Instead, the club will go on without a player who first joined aged 19 in 2012, with Verratti set to complement an impressive Al Hilal midfield alongside Ruben Neves and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic."
Jordan Henderson posts farewell to Liverpool ahead of Al Ettifaq transfer,"Jul 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jordan-henderson-farewell-liverpool-ahead-al-ettifaq-transfer,"Jordan Henderson has posted a farewell message to Liverpool fans ahead of his controversial transfer to Al Ettifaq in Saudi Arabia. Henderson leaves Liverpool after 12 years, including the last eight as captain, and is set to earn a multi-million pound fortune as a result of a lucrative contract thought to be worth as much as Â£100,000 per day in the Saudi Pro League. The transfer has drawn massive criticism, with Henderson taking his career to a country where homosexuality is illegal, despite having previously been a vocal supporter of LGBTQ+ causes. It more than trebles the Â£190,000 per week contract he had at Liverpool and is set to make an already extremely rich man vastly more wealthy. The use of âlife-changingâ in some of the reporting on his new deal in Saudi Arabia has also been heavily criticised amid a cost of living crisis in the UK. Prior to his farewell message being posted on social media, Henderson had already started training with Al Ettifaq, managed by ex-Liverpool teammate Steven Gerrard, having travelled to the clubâs ongoing summer training camp in Croatia. manual ""I need to somehow put into words what these last 12 years have meant for me and my family,"" was how he began the video, sat in the Anfield dressing room for the 'last time'. ""It was hard leaving [Sunderland], my home town, my club. But when Liverpool come knocking, you don't say no. When I see the footage back now, I'm just a kid. Who would ever have imagined that night how the next 12 years would go?"" he said. ""I can't lie, there have been hard timesâ¦really hard times. But when I look back at my career at Liverpool, it will always be the good times that I remember. ""Being made captain of Liverpool Football Club was one of the greatest honours of my life. From the day the armband was passed to me, I did everything I could to behave like a Liverpool captain should. But the biggest honours at Liverpool weren't personal ones, they were collective â all of us [the players], all of you [the fans], together."" A post shared by Jordan Henderson (@jordanhenderson) Henderson went on to say there is 'no doubt' that Liverpool fans are the 'best in the world' and also declared Anfield to be 'the most special place in the world to play football'. Directly addressing supporters, he finished by saying, ""Thank you for allowing me to be part of your club, for your support in good times and bad. I will always be a red, until the day I die."" Henderson played close to 500 games for Liverpool following his 2011 transfer just over a week before his 21st birthday. He went on to captain the Reds to Champions League glory in 2019, as well as lifting the club's first league title in 30 years in 2020. Domestic cups followed in 2022, while Liverpool played in two further Champions League finals â 2018 and 2022."
Man Utd make offer worth Â£51.4m for Atalanta's Rasmus Hojlund,"Jul 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-make-offer-worth-60m-rasmus-hojlund,"Manchester United have made an offer worth Â£51.4m for Atalanta striker Rasmus Hojlund, 90min understands. United's offer is worth â¬50m (Â£42.8m, $55.4m) plus an additional â¬10m (Â£8.6m, $11m) in add-ons, though it's understood to fall short of the Italian club's valuation of the 20-year-old. Talks are ongoing between the two clubs at present and United are pushing to get the deal done by the start of August in order to integrate Hojlund with his potential new teammates before the start of the 2023/24 campaign. The offer has not been rejected out of hand, but United are now prepared to go higher if necessary and some ground will likely need to be made up to reach a price closer to Atalanta's valuation - understood to be â¬70m (Â£59.9m, $77.5m). feed United have agreed personal terms in principle with Hojlund and the player wants the move, citing himself previously as a United fan. There is understood to be optimism that a deal will eventually be reached, with the two clubs in talks for a number of months. The Red Devils have already strengthened Erik ten Hag's squad with the captures of goalkeeper Andre Onana and midfielder Mason Mount, while Jonny Evans has returned to the club on a short-term deal to provide pre-season cover in defence. Marcus Rashford recently signed a new five-year contract in a further boost to United, with the 25-year-old looking to build on a career-best season that saw him score 30 goals in all competitions."
Milan summer signing reveals receiving late Barcelona approach,"Jul 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/milan-summer-signing-reveals-receiving-late-barcelona-approach,"Tijjani Reijnders has admitted that Xavi tried to convince him to join Barcelona this summer, but the call came too late as he had already agreed to join Milan. The Rossoneri are reinvesting the money made through the sale of Sandro Tonali to Newcastle United, bringing in six senior players since the opening of the transfer window. Christian Pulisic and Ruben Loftus-Cheek have joined from Chelsea, while Marco Sportiello and Luka Romero have completed free transfers from Atalanta and Lazio respectively. Noah Okafor recently seal his move from Red Bull Salzburg, joining Reijnders following his arrival from AZ Alkmaar. Speaking to Gazzetta dello Sport, the Dutchman revealed that he was the subject of a late approach from Barcelona, but he had committed to Milan and so pushed ahead with a move to San Siro. feed ""Xavi called me to discuss possible move to Barcelona,"" Reijnders said. ""It was impossible for me - no way, as I already decided to join AC Milan. ""I had made my choice. I had spoken to [Geoffrey] Moncada and [Stefano] Pioli, and at that point I had already made up my mind, including with my family. I had already decided that I would play for Milan."" While Reijnders spurned Barcelona's advances, the Spanish champions have made three signings so far this summer. Ilkay Gundogan decided to leave Manchester City and head to Catalonia on a free transfer, as did Athletic Club defender Inigo Martinez. La Masia graduate Oriol Romeu completed his return to Barcelona from Girona last week."
West Ham's transfer strategy: What is going on?,"Jul 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-transfer-strategy-what-is-going-on,"The highlight of West Ham United's transfer window to date, or lowlight as many fans would see it, has been the sale of Declan Rice to Arsenal. The 24-year-old, less than two months after lifting the Europa Conference League trophy above his head, departed for London rivals Arsenal in a deal that will eventually pocket West Ham a British-record Â£105m. It's a fantastic move for Rice on the surface, assuming Arsenal's performances on the field mirror what they've seemingly achieved in the transfer market, but also a fantastic deal for West Ham, who had known for a long time that their captain was destined to move on in a bid to further his career. One would assume that with the influx of cash at West Ham, coupled with Europa League football once again being on offer, that prospective signings would be queueing up outside London Stadium looking to pull on claret and blue each and every week in front of 60,000+ supporters.  But as is so often the case with business at West Ham, things aren't quite that simple.  By this point in last year's summer transfer window, Nayef Aguerd, Alphonse Areola, Flynn Downes had already arrived, while Gianluca Scamacca was being unveiled as the club's fourth major signing of the window. Four further new faces followed, including Lucas Paqueta, and West Ham finished the window as one of the biggest spenders in Europe. Fast forward 12 months and, with a European trophy under their belt and the club's reputation higher than ever, just one player has arrived at West Ham. That one player is a 17-year-old winger from Cliftonville, Sean Moore, who in all likelihood won't be anywhere near the first team squad this season.  Worryingly, the Premier League season starts in 17 days at the time of writing. So what's going on? Wednesday 7 June, 2023 is a date that West Ham supporters around the world will remember forever. A night when the club ended a 43-year trophy drought, beating Fiorentina in the Europa Conference League final in Prague thanks to Jarrod Bowen's dramatic 90th minute winner. Remarkably, that was West Ham's 14th win in the 15 European games played during the season - the 1-1 draw away at Gent in the first leg of their last eight clash the only blemish on the Hammers' otherwise perfect record. That streak is even more remarkable when you consider West Ham's performances in the Premier League. After an incredibly slow start which saw the club lose five of their first seven games, David Moyes quickly adopted survival mode in an attempt to navigate a fixture schedule like no other. Playing every Sunday and Thursday, with domestic cup competitions and a World Cup thrown in for good measure, the volume of games was relentless. Quickly out the window was the notion that West Ham could play a more free-flowing, expansive brand of football, playing to the strengths of marquee signing Paqueta. Instead, it was very apparent that Moyes was doing whatever it took to avoid defeat - West Ham's defensive line getting deeper and deeper with each passing week - and that Michail Antonio would often be taking on a back four all on his own. It meant that West Ham's major signings, Paqueta and Scamacca, were nowhere near as effective as they could have been. The former struggled to impose himself in the early months of the season, acclimatising to the pace of the Premier League, while the latter never really got going at any point during 2022/23 - he even struggled to get into the side before injury struck. After the World Cup, Paqueta began to showcase his quality, stamping his authority on games more and more, and he was soon one of West Ham's most consistent performers. But the results still didn't come in the Premier League. The final day 2-1 defeat to Leicester City, who themselves endured a shocking season to go down, was the 20th time the Hammers, who ended up finishing 14th, had come away from a game with nothing. The 20th time. It's no surprise then that David Sullivan, regardless of West Ham's achievements in Europe, was pretty underwhelmed by what he'd seen. Paqueta, with a splash of Emerson, Aguerd, Areola and Thilo Kehrer thrown in, had been the only incoming to really, really impress, with Moyes' position as manager considered on a number of occasions. The Scot's dealings in the market, led alongside head of recruitment Rob Newman, were under the microscope, with Sullivan seemingly unwilling to make the same mistakes again this time around. The decision was eventually taken to hire a technical director tasked with overseeing the club's player recruitment strategy and scouting, and the successful candidate was Tim Steidten, formerly of Werder Bremen and Bayer Leverkusen. Serge Gnabry, Kevin De Bruyne (on loan) and Thomas Delaney are three premier examples of the profile, and calibre, of player identified by Steidten during his time at Werder Bremen. All three under the age of 22 when signed, clearly gifted and with a high ceiling in terms of potential. Moussa Diaby, Jeremie Frimpong, Edmond Tapsoba and Piero Hincapie four further signings during Steidten's time at Bayer Leverkusen, all of whom fall into a similar mould. It's clear to see that Steidten works towards a particular philosophy and plan. He identifies young players who can come in and change the dynamic of a team not only now but also in the years to come. Players with potentially huge resale value in the future - likely to outgrow the club in all likelihood but extremely coachable and able to adapt to what's being asked of them - and often players bought directly from source. It's a business model that many teams in continental Europe adopt. Red Bull Salzburg in Austria is perhaps the biggest raw talent of pool of the last decade, and it's a way of working that Brighton & Hove Albion have been implementing over the last few years. The club's reputation? Sky rocketing. The club's bank balance? Consistently ticking over. The club's cohesion in terms of recruitment? Faultless. West Ham could do a lot worse than the players Steidten is identifying, particularly as they all indicate pulling in one direction. Youssouf Fofana, Denis Zakaria, Edson Alvarez, Elye Wahi and the aforementioned Tah are all players the German has recommended as signings - the most expensive of that quintet likely to be Ajax's Alvarez, who was previously of interest to Chelsea and Manchester United and had looked likely to join Borussia Dortmund earlier this summer. Zakaria is the oldest of the five at 26, but the downside from Moyes' point of view is that he is the only player with any Premier League experience. West Ham's manager sees things very differently in terms of what's needed to plug the gap left by Rice, as well as in other positions - he wants players who can slot into the side immediately, understanding the rigours of top flight football in England. At least in Carlos Borges' case, there seems to be willingness from both Moyes and Steidten to do that particular deal. Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher is a player West Ham have been tracking for a long, long time. Young, full of running and very talented with both feet, the 23-year-old has a number of desirable attributes, and is a regular in Gareth Southgate's England squad. The issue for West Ham here, and other interested parties, is Gallagher's price. The Hammers verbally indicated they would be prepared to pay Â£40m to Chelsea, inclusive of bonuses, but that figure falls some way short of what the Blues want. It's a similar story over at Fulham, with two West Ham bids for Joao Palhinha, a player who is 28, turned down - the second of which 90min understands was worth Â£50m. Scott McTominay, Harry Maguire, James Ward-Prowse are three further players identified by Moyes this summer, all of whom have an abundance of Premier League football under their belt and would probably expect to be starters. But with a premium price point applied for playing in England, none of the three will come cheap. Most importantly, they appear to conflict with Steidten's long-term vision for the club - they don't really carry any resale value and, in truth, are unlikely to improve as footballers. Gallagher perhaps bucks the trend in terms of his current ability and potential, but coming close to Chelsea's asking price would significantly dent the Hammers' budget. Steidten's targets, with the exception of Alvarez, are probably attainable for half of that price and that's where the issue lies. The end result is West Ham are not as far forward as they should be this summer. With two-and-a-half weeks of the season to go, central midfield is an area of real concern and any new signing will need to slot straight into the side. That points towards West Ham heading in the direction of Moyes' preferred targets, as avoiding a slow start will be a high priority. Verbal enquiries and offers have been put in for close to a dozen players, yet nothing concrete has been put forward. Seemingly, there's no overarching agreement of what West Ham need, so instead it's a feeling out process to gauge the feel of the market. Ultimately, the Hammers may end up alienating either Moyes or Steidten, making a long-term co-operation between the pair less and less likely. The only certainty right now is that the pressure is on West Ham to spend - they must decide on what direction they are going in and they must do it quickly."
Mauricio Pochettino responds to Chelsea links to Kylian Mbappe,"Jul 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/mauricio-pochettino-responds-chelsea-links-kylian-mbappe,"Chelsea head coach Mauricio Pochettino has responded to the club's alleged interest in Kylian Mbappe. Paris Saint-Germain are looking to sell Mbappe this summer after he informed them he would not be extending his contract beyond 2024. 90min understands that Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal have had a world-record Â£259m bid for the forward accepted by PSG, though he will need convincing in order to leave Europe despite the offer of a lucrative contract. Though Mbappe is ultimately holding out for a move to Real Madrid, he has been heavily linked with other clubs across Europe such as Chelsea. However, sources have told 90min that this has come from intermediaries acting on behalf of PSG in order to find an alternative buyer. Pochettino, who worked with Mbappe at PSG from 2020 to 2022, was asked about Chelsea's links with the 24-year-old in a press conference prior to the Blues' pre-season friendly against Newcastle United. manual ""I think in our past we were at Paris Saint-Germain and with Kylian and think I need to be conscious that I cannot talk,"" Pochettino said. ""Everything you talk is too much noise. It is a situation that is very delicate and one they need to fix in Paris with Kylian. For our side, I have nothing to say."" He added: ""We are working on our reality, our reality is different. From my side, nothing to say, only to support them. ""I hope they find a solution for both sides. It is a club that I love because I was a player, a captain and a coach. With Kylian we created a very good relationship, I hope they can find the best solution for both sides."" While Chelsea will not be entering the sweepstakes for Mbappe, 90min understands they are discussing personal terms with Ajax forward Mohammed Kudus."
Bayern Munich continuing efforts to sign Kyle Walker from Man City,"Jul 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-continuing-efforts-kyle-walker-man-city,"Bayern Munich are work harding to convince England defender Kyle Walker to leave Manchester City this transfer window, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 33-year-old has held talks with Bayern about a potential switch to the Allianz Arena this summer and the German champions have come away from discussions confident that he wants to join them, though he is yet to confirm his next move. Walker informed City at the end of last season of his desire to move after he was not named in their Champions League final starting XI, but they remain hopeful he can be persuaded to stay and have offered him a new contract up to 2025 - his current deal expires next year. City boss Pep Guardiola has made it clear to Walker that he wants him to stay, although it remains to be seen if that will be enough to sway his decision. ""He's an incredibly important player for us, he has specific qualities, so difficult to find worldwide. His specific qualities are irreplaceable,"" Guardiola said ahead of their timely pre-season friendly with Bayern. ""We want him, yes. In the end, I don't know what will happen. I know we're in contact, both clubs, we will fight for him like I'm sure Bayern will do it. I don't know how it will finish. ""I heard the comments from Thomas Tuchel about Kyle, I will say the same. What I can say he is a very important player for us, he has a very specific quality, formidable opponent out wide. That quality is irreplaceable. The clubs are in touch, we will fight for him."" feed Bayern president Herbert Hainer also confirmed they remain keen on Walker and are working on the transfer. ""It shows that Pep appreciates the player. We have a certain interest in him,"" said Hainer. ""We have to see how that will develop in the next few weeks. We still have some time in the transfer window."" Having already lost Lucas Hernandez to PSG and preparing for the sale of Benjamin Pavard, Bayern are understood to have made Walker a contract offer which exceeds that of City's. If and when Bayern get a green-light from Walker, they will make an official bid for the player."
Bayern Munich seek new Daniel Levy meeting to thrash out Harry Kane deal,"Jul 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-seek-new-daniel-levy-meeting-to-thrash-out-harry-kane-deal,"Bayern Munich want to step up their pursuit of Harry Kane and set up another meeting with Tottenham Hotspur chairman Daniel Levy, 90min understands. The Bundesliga champions have already seen two bids knocked back by Spurs for Kane, whose contract in north London expires in 2024. 90min recently reported that Tottenham are refusing to set an asking price for their star striker as they still retain confidence of securing his long-term future - Kane's representatives have not ruled out this possibility to the club. Levy met Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen earlier in July, though the Spurs chairman gave no indication or suggestion that Kane would be sold. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Dreesen and Bayern technical director Marco Neppe did not travel with the club for their pre-season tour of Asia as they would like to meet with Levy in person again in hope of thrashing out a deal for Kane. feed Levy, however, remains hopeful that head coach Ange Postecoglou's impact could yet persuade Kane to stay at Spurs. Bayern have floated the idea of attaching a player to their next bid, which is expected to be worth a club-record Â£86m, and Benjamin Pavard may be on the table. However, there is little to suggest that this will entice Tottenham, who are continuing talks for alternate Bundesliga centre-backs in Edmond Tapsoba and Micky van de Ven. In an interview with Kicker, Bayern chairman Herbert Hainer - who is currently focusing his energies on trying to sign Kyle Walker from Manchester City - continued the club's public courting of Kane. ""Here in the Bundesliga, we don't have many international stars any more,"" Hainer said. ""Bayern always try to bring in stars.

Romeo Lavia: Southampton manager discusses midfielder's future following Liverpool bid,"Jul 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/romeo-lavia-southampton-manager-future-liverpool-bid,"Southampton manager Russell Martin has given an update on Romeo Lavia after the midfielder was the subject of a bid from Liverpool. 90min reported this week that the Reds had seen an opening offer of Â£35m plus add-ons for Lavia rejected by Southampton, with the offer said to be 'miles away' from the club's valuation of the young midfielder. The 19-year-old has been linked with a myriad of top Premier League clubs all summer. Along with Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea have also been notably interested in the services of Lavia. Manchester City still hold a Â£40m buy-back clause which will become active next summer. Despite the talk about his future, Lavia has been an active part of Southampton's pre-season plans, playing against Bournemouth in a friendly on Tuesday as the club get ready for a Championship campaign after suffering Premier League relegation in 2022/23.  feed Speaking after that game to the press, new manager Martin discussed Lavia's situation and admitted the player has 'a lot in his head' due to transfer speculation.   ""The transfer window should close before the start of the season - it's ridiculous in my opinion and certainly not helpful,"" Martin said. ""We're a club that has been relegated and has a lot of talent that people are attracted to, but we'll prepare as if they will be here because we have to. There's no guarantee that anyone will leave, it's a lot of work with 27 players or whatever but we'll give everyone a chance to get on the pitch. ""I thought Romeo, considering what's going on, to play tonight and do all that stuff, it was good for him to get on the pitch as he has not had the minutes other people have had. ""You can ask for an update, but I can't give you one because I don't know. I'm going to speak to Jason [Wilcox, director of football] now but I've been preparing for this game. I'll only ever be honest with you guys but Iâm yet to find out. ""Romeo has a lot in his head."" Martin added: ""[I am] pleased with his attitude, easiest thing to do would be to not play tonight. Not easy for a young player to handle the noise, but he's handled it well. Latest news is very public, he may still be here he may not."""

Fulham confirm signing of Raul Jimenez from Wolves,"Jul 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/fulham-confirm-signing-raul-jimenez-from-wolves,"Fulham have announced the signing of Mexico international Raul Jimenez from Wolves on a two-year contract with an option for a further season. Jimenez originally joined Wolves in July of 2018 on loan from Atletico Madrid, scoring 17 goals in 44 appearances. His stellar performances from that campaign helped Wolves finish in seventh place, and they were quick to make his move permanent in the 2019 summer transfer window. During his time at the Molineux, the 32-year-old scored 57 goals and added 24 assists in in 166 appearances across all competitions. The former Benfica player leaves Wolves as their fourth-highest goalscorer in club history. He has now joined Fulham and manager Marco Silva, who rejected an offer to manager Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli, and will more than likely take the place of Aleksandar Mitrovic, who's expected to leave Craven Cottage this summer for Al Hilal.  ""The Club is delighted to announce the signing of Raul Jimenez from Wolverhampton Wanderers for an undisclosed fee,"" Fulham said in a statement.  Si SeÃ±orâ¦ ð²ð½ pic.twitter.com/v8OlRcRM3l ""It's really important for me to arrive here,"" JimÃ©nez said to Fulham's club channels.

Jimenez added: ""I'm happy to be here and to play in this stadium, itâs a really good stadium, I like it here. Iâm going to give my best to keep scoring goals in the Premier League.""  Fulham owner Tony Khan said: ""I'm excited to welcome Raul JimÃ©nez to Fulham!

Chelsea discussing personal terms with Ajax's Mohammed Kudus; Arsenal & Man Utd retain interest,"Jul 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-discussing-personal-terms-ajax-mohammed-kudus-arsenal-man-utd-retain-interest,"Chelsea have held talks with the representatives of versatile Ajax star Mohammed Kudus, 90min understands, with both Arsenal and Manchester United keeping watch on the situation. The Ghana international, whose versatility sees him used regularly at striker, winger or in midfield, has entered the final two years of his contract in Amsterdam and a handful of European giants have voiced an interest in striking a deal. Sources have confirmed that Chelsea have made the first move this summer, reaching out to Kudus' entourage to discuss personal terms. Chelsea are confident that contract negotiations would not be an issue with Kudus and, now with an understanding of his demands, are considering their next move. The Blues are not believed to have made contact with Ajax at this point. Kudus' situation is being followed closely by a number of Premier League sides, including Manchester United, where former Ajax boss Erik ten Hag is open to a reunion. feed The 22-year-old spent his final year under Ten Hag, the 2021/22 campaign, playing in central midfield but a switch to striker this season yielded a return of 18 goals and seven assists in 42 appearances - the sort of numbers which will undoubtedly appeal to a number of managers across Europe. While United are currently focused on landing Atalanta's Rasmus Hojlund to address their goalscoring needs, Kudus is seen as a viable alternative and an attempt to sign both players has not yet been ruled out either. As 90min revealed in May, signing two strikers remains on the agenda for United. United are keeping informed of Kudus' situation alongside Arsenal, who are known admirers of the Ghanaian and keen to ensure they are up to date with any negotiations. 90min revealed last month that Brighton had also made contact with Kudus' representatives but the Seagulls are not currently his preferred option, with Kudus himself understood to be keen to explore a move to a more high-profile side at this point."
Five potential free transfer targets for Barcelona with links to Xavi,"Jul 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/five-potential-free-transfer-targets-barcelona-links-xavi,"It's hard to define Barcelona's transfer policy since Xavi took the hot seat in 2021. Scattergun would be harsh, but pinpointing a particular strategy is tricky. Xavi, however, has helped cultivate a winning team, even if they've struggled in Europe thus far. The club's financial woes have ensured the former BarÃ§a midfielder hasn't had it easy on the recruitment front. Still, some savvy lever-pulling last summer facilitated a La Liga title in 2022/23 as Robert Lewandowski and Jules Kounde both played vital roles in the club's triumph.  BarÃ§a are again working on a shoestring budget this summer as they attempt to assert themselves at the summit of Spanish football once more. The free agent market is one they might have to dabble in as the window wears on, and here are a few familiar options for Xavi to consider.  Some might label it insanity if Barcelona go back in for former academy graduate Adama Traore following his underwhelming loan spell in 2022.  Unstoppable on his day, Traore's inconsistency and technical limitations have deterred many clubs from ever making a move to sign the Spanish international. BarÃ§a did take the plunge midway through the 2021/22 campaign when Xavi was at the helm, but he was quickly ostracised despite a bright enough start to his loan spell.  The club unsurprisingly opted against buying Traore permanently at the end of the season, but hey, he's available again, folks! Round three?  Cut from the same cloth as other great Spanish number tens of his generation, Isco enjoyed his peak years in the capital as opposed to Catalonia. Thus, Isco never combined with Xavi at club level, but their international careers did just about intertwine. Isco's senior debut arrived in 2013, a year before Xavi called it quits with La Roja. The former Barcelona midfielder wasn't in the squad when Isco made his debut against Uruguay in a friendly, and the two never actually featured alongside one another despite being named in several Spain squads together.  While Isco enjoyed great collective success at Real Madrid, he didn't quite live up to his early projections as a youngster. He left Los Blancos in 2022 and spent last season at Sevilla, but he's now without a club and it's unclear just how long he's got left at the highest level. Xavi's elegance and Sergio Ramos' robust aggression came to define the great ideological duel between Spain's two behemoths when Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola were marauding the Clasico touchline.  The two were perhaps never the best of friends given how entrenched each were in their respective club's ideals, but there's no doubting the underlying respect they had for one another. They met countless times during what was for a period the fiercest duel European football had to offer.  Xavi often hit out at Real's agricultural antics, of which Ramos was a staunch defender. Nevertheless, the pair seemed to put their club allegiances aside when representing the national team. Together, Ramos and Xavi won two European Championships and the 2010 World Cup as Spain emerged as the planet's footballing Mecca.  Ramos, who is six years Xavi's junior, is on the market after a two-year spell in Paris. A move to Barcelona is near-impossible, but the fantasy is Hollywood-worthy. Alexis spent three years at Barcelona with Xavi before moving to the Premier League in 2014. The Chilean dazzled without ever being regarded as a protagonist in Catalonia, and it wasn't until he signed for Arsenal that Alexis' reputation soared. The creative, but also prolific, forward reached superstardom in north London, with the current BarÃ§a boss labelling his former teammate as âone of the best attacking players in the worldâ while he was tearing it up at Arsenal. An ill-fated move to Man Utd damaged Alexis' reputation somewhat, but while he's since failed to reach the highs of his Arsenal stint, the Chilean legend proved more than serviceable for Antonio Conte at Inter before enjoying a fine season with Marseille in Ligue 1.  Now 34 and without a club, could the veteran enjoy one last hurrah in Catalonia? While one half of Barcelona's greatest midfield duo is calling the shots at Camp Nou these days, the other is determined to keep playing following his departure from Vissel Kobe. Andres Iniesta, now 39, epitomised Barcelona and is perhaps the only person on the planet who will understand Xavi's methods as well as the boss himself. His legs are likely gone but Iniesta's mind is still sharper than almost anyone on the planet. Xavi and Iniesta pulled the strings in Barcelona's midfield in front of Sergio Busquets, and it looks like a reunion with the latter could be on the cards as Iniesta is of interest to Major League Soccer's Inter Miami, but a return to Catalonia would be just as fascinating."
Fabinho's proposed Saudi Pro League switch in doubt,"Jul 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/fabinho-saudi-pro-league-switch-doubt,"Fabinho's proposed Â£40m switch from Liverpool to Saudi Pro League side Al Ittihad is on the rocks amid ongoing conversations around the structure of the deal, 90min understands. The 29-year-old, who still has three years left on his Anfield contract, was previously given permission to undergo a medical with the Saudi champions, before potentially linking up with Karim Benzema and N'Golo Kante at a club managed by former Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo. But despite both teams working towards a deal being finalised, the process has slowed down as Liverpool have not yet agreed the details of when certain amounts of the fee will be paid. 90min understands there's a willingness from Liverpool and Al Ittihad to work through the issue, but the Brazilian will, unexpectedly, return to training at the Reds' AXA Training Centre until an agreement can be found. Liverpool have already begun to plan for life after Fabinho and team-mate Jordan Henderson, who is also expected to head to Saudi Arabia in order to link up with former team-mate Steven Gerrard, now in charge of Al Ettifaq. The Reds have seen an opening offer for Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia rejected, though it's understood the club will return with an improved bid worth more than the Â£35m plus add-ons package they initially proposed. feed 19-year-old Lavia is more geared towards replacing Fabinho than Henderson, after starring in a defensive midfield role last season despite Southampton's relegation from the Premier League, and is valued by the Saints at over Â£50m. The Belgian is also on the radar of Arsenal and Chelsea, both of whom have admired the Belgian for a long time and could yet make moves of their own. Speaking recently to Liverpool's official club podcast, Jurgen Klopp recently said of his preparations for the new season and prospective new signings: ""My main focus and my main energy has to go into the training sessions, that's what I do,"" he told Liverpool's official club podcast. ""The time left and right of the sessions then I can try and sort other stuff, and that's what we are doing. ""Still around three to four weeks until the first game of the season, a few things have to happen until then. Definitely. Transfer market-wise as well, that's clear now. It will happen, and we will have a good team."" Liverpool have already drafted in Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai from Brighton & Hove Albion and RB Leipzig respectively, after letting a number of experienced midfielders leave the club. Naby Keita, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and James Milner have departed on free transfers, with Fabinho and Henderson's proposed exits indicating a significant changing of the guard for Liverpool in the centre of the park."
Liverpool see first offer for relegated Southampton star rejected,"Jul 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-first-offer-southampton-star-rejected,"Liverpool have seen a bid of Â£35m plus add-ons for Romeo Lavia turned down by Southampton, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Reds have already brought in Alexis Mac Allister from Brighton & Hove Albion and Dominik Szoboszlai from RB Leipzig this summer, but they are looking to conduct further business in the transfer market. 90min revealed earlier in July that Liverpool were set to battle it out with Arsenal and Chelsea for Southampton star Lavia, with the need for further reinforcements heightened by the potential sales of Fabinho and Jordan Henderson. The former's proposed move to Al Ittihad has hit a temporary snag, as the clubs negotiate the make-up of the Â£40m deal and when payments will be made, but Henderson looks on course to join former team-mate Steven Gerrard at Al Ettifaq, earning a bumper pay day in the process. Sources close to Southampton have now confirmed to 90min that a bid from Liverpool for Lavia, worth Â£35m plus add-ons, has been rejected, with the offer described as 'miles away' from the club's valuation. feed Indeed, it's believed Southampton are looking for at least Â£50m for 19-year-old Lavia, who impressed greatly last season despite the club's relegation to the Championship. Southampton are not in a rush to sell Lavia - knowing they could generate income from selling captain James Ward-Prowse - and are happy to keep him at St Mary's if Liverpool, or any other interested party, fail to meet their valuation. Lavia joined the Saints last summer from Manchester City having only played two games at senior level before, but quickly emerged as one of Europe's finest young midfielders during his first year on the south coast.  City retain a buy-back clause worth Â£40m which will become active next summer if he is still at Southampton, while Arsenal and Chelsea remain interested in Lavia and are keeping apprised of developments. Manchester United and Newcastle had previously touched base too, but they have not made contact recently and are looking at other targets."
Manchester City inform Bernardo Silva of transfer decision,"Jul 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/manchester-city-inform-bernardo-silva-transfer-decision,"Manchester City are ready to stand firm over Bernardo Silva's desire to leave and have told the Portuguese international they don't intend to sell him this summer, 90min understands. Silva informed City last summer that he wanted to play elsewhere as he courted interest from Barcelon. But a deal did not materialise as the club told him to stay for at least another season. The former Monaco starman did indeed stay and enjoyed another outstanding campaign for the Cityzens as they completed an historic Treble. However, Silva has again made it clear through his representatives that he would like the chance to move and has attracted considerable interest. Silva has little interest in an offer on the table from Saudi Arabia to join Al-Hilal, despite the lucrative nature of the contract. However, there is also strong interest from long-term suitors Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain, both of whom he is keen to talk to and explore a deal. Barcelona would love to sign Silva and sources have confirmed to 90min that they already would have done by now if they had the money available. But while they remain interested, the chances of the Catalans being able to put together a deal acceptable to City appears remote at this stage. feed Then there is PSG. New head coach Luis Enrique has made it clear to his bosses that he wants Silva and the club's football advisor, Luis Campos, has already held talks with both Silva and City. They have informed their European champions they would be willing to meet their asking price, believed to be around Â£75m. But that still may not be enough to get a deal done. The talks with City have not progressed and the English side have held their own conversations with Silva. The message they are making clear is that they can't afford to lose him this summer. Pep Guardiola rarely likes to keep any player who wants to leave and has a history of letting them go - Leroy Sane, Gabriel Jesus, Raheem Sterling and most recently Riyad Mahrez, to name examples. But Silva's case is set to be different and Guardiola is adamant he does not want to see him move on, especially given the sale of Mahrez and the earlier loss of club captain Ilkay Gundogan. They have already brought in Mateo Kovavic from Chelsea, but the belief is that Silva is too hard to replace.  90min understands that City have looked around at other midfield options, with Bayern Munich's Joshua Kimmich, Inter's Nicolo Barella and Bayer Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz amongst those they have done work on. But neither looks to be available and it makes the need to keep Silva more pressing. To try and smooth things over with Silva, sources have told 90min that City are prepared to offer him one of the biggest deals in their history and put him in the same bracket as the likes of Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne. Officials hope that sort of offer could demonstrate his importance to the club and persuade him to stay. Silva's current deal is due to run until 2025, which puts City in a strong position as they don't need to sell, but still want to reward him if he does stay."
Chelsea open to Conor Gallagher sale but firm on valuation,"Jul 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-open-conor-gallagher-transfer--firm-on-valuation-west-ham-tottenham,"Chelsea are open to selling Conor Gallagher this summer, 90min understands, but will only do business if interested parties are prepared to meet their valuation. The 23-year-old featured in 35 Premier League games for Chelsea last season, scoring three goals, but failed to command a regular starting place under any of the club's three managers - Thomas Tuchel, Graham Potter or Frank Lampard. The Blues have let an abundance of central midfielders leave this summer as the Mauricio Pochettino era gets underway, with Mason Mount, N'Golo Kante and Mateo Kovacic among those to depart. Ruben Loftus-Cheek has also left Chelsea to join AC Milan, in the hope of earning more regular starting time, both in Serie A and in Europe. Chelsea have shown great interest in signing Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo over the past few months - a player valued by the Seagulls at around Â£100m - and sources have confirmed to 90min that the Blues, despite their lack of options, would be open to letting Gallagher leave were an acceptable offer to come in. feed West Ham United have made an enquiry about Gallagher's potential price tag and have verbally indicated a price they would be willing to pay - 90min understands that reports of a formal Â£40m offer being put in are wide of the mark. Chelsea would be prepared to sell Gallagher if they were to receive an offer around Â£50m, though Pochettino remains open to the player staying at Stamford Bridge to fight for his place. Gallagher for his part is concerned about his opportunities at the club long-term and is willing to explore a move away. London rivals Tottenham are maintaining an interest in Gallagher's situation, while Brighton, who will compete in this season's Europa League, previously held talks over a potential move this summer but were put off by the five-time Premier League champions' valuation. Gallagher is one of a number of players being targeted by West Ham, who have money to spend after persuading Arsenal to part with a British-record Â£105m to sign captain Declan Rice. Scott McTominay and James Ward-Prowse are other homegrown targets of David Moyes, while new technical director Tim Steidten is busy scouring Europe looking for more affordable options."
Anthony Elanga joins Nottingham Forest on permanent transfer,"Jul 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/anthony-elanga-joins-nottingham-forest-permanent-transfer,"Nottingham Forest have completed the signing of Manchester United and Sweden forward Anthony Elanga on a permanent transfer. Elanga broke in the United first-team in 2021 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but has found consistent game time difficult to come by. It is thought that Forest have paid Â£15m for the Swede, with a long-term contract signed until the summer of 2028. ""It's a pleasure to be here.

""I had interest from elsewhere, but for me, Nottingham Forest feels like the perfect place. I've been here with United, and from the minute I stepped out for the warm-up, I could hear them from the changing room. It's a special place, but being here with Forest, I feel like it will be even more special."" feed Elanga, 21, had earlier posted his own statement bidding farewell to his now former club. ""Making my debut, playing over 50 times for the first team, scoring in the Champions League and winning a trophy for this incredible club,"" he wrote. ""If you told me that all of that would happen when I arrived in England at 11 years old I would have been buzzing. ""There are so many players and staff that have played a major role in helping to make those dreams become a reality and supported me into developing into the man that I am today. I will be forever grateful to each and every one of you. ""From the moment that I watched a game from the Stretford End as a young boy Iâve known that United fans are special. Weâll always have âRhythm is a dancerâ. It meant the world to me and my family every time that we heard that chant. There are not enough words to properly thank you for the unbelievable support. It is the right time now for the perfect next step in my career. Iâm someone who lives for football and I need to be on the pitch every week doing what I love."""

The 30-year-old's contract at Selhurst Park expired at the end of June and he took plenty of time to weigh up his options and decide his next move.

In a parting statement, Crystal Palace said: ""Wilfried Zaha has joined Galatasaray, following the expiration of his contract with Crystal Palace.

Erik ten Hag responds to Man Utd links with Kylian Mbappe,"Jul 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/erik-ten-hag-responds-man-utd-links-kylian-mbappe,"Erik ten Hag has been quizzed on Manchester United's supposed interest in Kylian Mbappe.

The forward previously intimated he would not sign a new contract beyond 2024. PSG accepted a world-record Â£259m bid from Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal on Monday, allowing Mbappe to hold talks over personal terms. While Al Hilal have made their move, a number of clubs have been linked with Mbappe in hope that he would prefer to stay in Europe. United have been touted as a potential destination in recent days and Ten Hag was asked about whether he's interested in Mbappe at a press conference ahead of their pre-season friendly against Real Madrid in Houston. ""We never speak about players who are under contract in other clubs,"" the Dutchman said. manual Though Ten Hag was in no mood to talk about Mbappe, he did insist that United are pressing forward in their search for a new striker, with Atalanta's Rasmus Hojlund agreeing personal terms over a move to Old Trafford.

""For me, as soon as possible, the earlier the better, because we have to integrate him in the team, the way of play. In an ideal situation, he was already here but you do not always get ideal situations as a manager and you have to deal with the situation.

Son Heung-min makes admission on Harry Kane's potential Tottenham exit,"Jul 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/son-heung-min-admission-harry-kane-potential-tottenham-exit,"Son Heung-min has insisted he will respect whatever decision Harry Kane makes on his Tottenham future as strong interest from German champions Bayern Munich persists.

There's so much news going around it's also not easy for him, but he's captain at the moment and he's working with the team. ""He doesn't show any distraction. He loves being here. I love him as a player. I fully respect him. He's one of the best strikers in the world, has been for five, six, seven years in a row. ""The decision will be between the club and Harry and we have to respect it. I can't say anything about the final decision because I don't know anything. Probably Harry doesn't know. We just have to wait."" After having a clash with Leicester cancelled due to adverse weather conditions, Tottenham's next pre-season friendly is against Lion City Sailors on Wednesday 26 July - a game Kane is expected to feature in despite the lingering question marks over his future."
Chelsea's chosen destination for Angelo loan revealed,"Jul 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-chosen-destination-angelo-loan-revealed,"Chelsea plan to send young prodigy Angelo to Strasbourg on loan for the upcoming 2023/24 season, according to the French side's chief scout. The 18-year-old winger signed from Santos for Â£13m earlier this summer having made 129 appearances in all competitions for the Brazilian side, scoring five goals. Angelo was taken on Chelsea's summer tour to the United States and has featured in wins over Brighton and Wrexham in July so far. It was decided upon his signing that the Brazilian would train with the Blues this summer, as revealed by 90min, and he will soon have the opportunity to showcase his talents in Ligue 1 if he joins Patrick Vieira's side as their scout suggests. On Angelo's future, chief scout Loic Desire said: ""He won't be arriving straight away, as Chelsea want to integrate him into the club first. He'll come in August after the tour of the United States. We want to bring more variety to Patrick Vieira.""  Strasbourg was recently bought by BlueCo, Chelsea's American owners. The French club's president Marc Keller previously claimed receiving Chelsea players on loan wasn't part of their original strategy, stating: ""It isn't the project. ""We have had meetings with the sports department to define the objectives. We will have more means to be more ambitious. Loic Desire will have the handle on discussions about players that could interest us if there are any. They also have to want to come to us."" Angelo was the youngest debutant in the history of the Brazilian top flight at 15 years and 308 days and has made appearances for the country's Under-15, Under-17 and Under-20 teams. The Blues are expected to part with a number of youth players on loan deals, having already shipped out a legion of unwanted first-team squad members."
Kylian Mbappe: PSG accept world record Â£259m bid from Al Hilal,"Jul 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/breaking-psg-accept-world-record-259m-al-hilal-kylian-mbappe,"Paris Saint-Germain have accepted Al Hilal's â¬300m (Â£259m) offer for Kylian Mbappe, sources have confirmed to 90min. The long-term Real Madrid target has been put up for sale by PSG and left out of the pre-season tour of Japan, with the club not prepared to allow Mbappe to wind down his contract in the French capital, which has less than a year to run. Mbappe has already indicated that he will not be exercising the 12-month option to extend, leading PSG to look at selling the 24-year-old this summer before he's able to walk away for free. The Ligue 1 giants had been hoping to garner a fee of around â¬200m (Â£172m) for Mbappe, in the hope that Real Madrid would make a move, but 90min revealed on Monday that Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal - one of four clubs financially backed by the country's Public Investment Fund (PIF) - had entered the running with a gargantuan offer worth â¬300m (Â£259m). Sources have now confirmed to 90min that PSG have, understandably, accepted the offer for Mbappe, with relations between the club and the player seemingly at an all-time low. He now has permission to discuss with Al Hilal a potential move to Saudi Arabia, who have already attracted Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema to the country over the past seven months. A whole host of other big name players - Roberto Firmino, Kalidou Koulibaly and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic among others - have already made the move to cash-rich Saudi this summer, with the enormous wages and bonuses on offer proving too good to turn down. manual 90min understands that Mbappe's camp are yet to respond to the interest from Al Hilal, but the player has previously had his heart set on joining Real Madrid - his relationship with club president Florentino Perez remains unblemished despite a dramatic U-turn that saw Mbappe shun Madrid's advances in 2022 in favour of signing a new PSG contract. Intermediaries working on behalf of PSG are attempting to drive up interest in Mbappe from elsewhere, 90min further understands, though Al Hilal's world record bid - which is close to â¬80m (Â£69m) more than the current transfer record - would be impossible for any side to compete with.  Nevertheless, PSG want to ensure they leave 'no stone unturned' as they prepare to part ways with Mbappe. Real Madrid have kept their cards close to their chest to date, knowing that in six months they can agree to sign Mbappe on a pre-contract agreement, and must now watch on as Al Hilal attempt to persuade him that a move to Saudi Arabia, at least in the short-term, is in his best interests."
Five potential free transfer targets for Manchester United with links to Erik ten Hag,"Jul 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/five-potential-free-transfer-targets-manchester-united-links-erik-ten-hag,"Manchester United's transfer policy under Erik ten Hag has revolved around known quantities. Ten Hag has had less than three full transfer windows at Old Trafford but United have already spent more than Â£150m on players that their Dutch coach has managed in the past. The arrival of former Ajax goalkeeper Andre Onana is merely a continuation of the policy that brought Lisandro Martinez and Antony to the north of England. If United are intent on sticking to the reunion strategy, they may be tempted to dip their toe into the free agent market. Here are some of the free transfers with an all-important link to Ten Hag that last season's League Cup winners could snag this summer. What. A. Moment. ðOne year ago today, Lucas Moura wrote himself into the Tottenham Hotspur history books FOREVER!Football is incredible ð¤¯ pic.twitter.com/qH4c6RsXft ""Football can be very beautiful,"" Ten Hag mused after steering Ajax to their first Champions League semi-final since the 1990s. ""And it can be very cruel."" At half-time of the second leg, Ajax led Tottenham 3-0 on aggregate. Ten Hag warned his players about a possible comeback but could scarcely have predicted Lucas Moura's second-half hat-trick, sealed in the 96th minute, to send Spurs to the final in Madrid. Four years on from that cruel evening, Moura has come to the end of his Tottenham contract, giving Ten Hag the chance to have the Brazilian on his side this time. Despite scoring on his league debut for FC Utrecht after Ten Hag signed him in the summer of 2017, Sander van de Streek enjoyed his best form for the club once his coach had been poached by Ajax mid-season. Across the final 11 games of the 2017/18 campaign, Van de Streek rifled in seven goals (and created another three). The box-crashing midfielder saw out his deal at Utrecht this summer and could be given another chance to show Ten Hag his full value. feed Mark Diemers had been at FC Utrecht for four years but lasted just six months before Ten Hag deemed him surplus to requirements, sending the midfielder on a loan which turned into a free transfer to De Graafschap. When Ten Hag was appointed Manchester United manager, Diemers praised the coach's ""insanely good"" tactical training sessions but warned: ""I just didn't think he was very good at the time on a human level."" However, the pair have fired off sporadic text messages to each other in the intervening years and Diemers stressed: ""He has undoubtedly grown at a human level."" Perhaps one of the next digital exchanges between the pair will involve a contractual offer. Ten Hag hailed Dario Dumic as a ""real killer"" when he signed the centre-back during his final summer as Utrecht manager in 2017. However, the then-25-year-old spent most of his six months under Ten Hag killing time on the substitutes bench. Even after Ten Hag moved to Ajax, Dumic struggled for playing time under his successors at Marco van Basten's boyhood club. After finishing bottom of the German second-tier with SV Sandhausen last season, a jump straight to Manchester United would represent a staggering career arch - especially for a 31-year-old. However, after spending time under Ten Hag's tutelage, Dumic's chances of a transfer to Old Trafford aren't entirely impossible. After steering Go Ahead Eagles to promotion during his first season of senior management, Ten Hag took the seemingly backwards step of coaching Bayern Munich's second team in the German fourth tier. Ten Hag used the two years wisely, soaking in as many secrets as he could prise away from the first team coach Pep Guardiola. When Ten Hag wasn't gawking at the senior side's training sessions, he was overseeing a team that had Patrick Weihrauch at its epicentre. While he made more than 100 appearances for Bayern II, Weihrauch never got a run out for the first team. Now 29, Weihrauch has come to the end of his time with Dynamo Dresden in Germany's third division. A reunion with Weihrauch may even go beyond Ten Hag's iron-clad loyalty."
Could Al Hilal actually sign Kylian Mbappe from PSG?,"Jul 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/could-al-hilal-actually-sign-kylian-mbappe-psg,"AL HILAL, FROM OUTTA NOWHERE! Kylian Mbappe's future had seemingly been heading towards a dreary conclusion this summer with a move to Real Madrid inevitable. With Paris Saint-Germain determined to garner a fee for their superstar before his contract expires next year, the Spanish giants were believed to be the only club capable of financing a deal for the Frenchman despite intrigue from the Premier League. Mbappe, meanwhile, has his heart set on the Spanish capital. However, the wealthiest of spanners has been thrown in the works. The financial might of Saudi Arabia and their unrelenting determination for football relevancy has seen Al Hilal table a world-record offer for Mbappe.  Their â¬300m bid has been accepted by PSG, and Mbappe will undoubtedly mull over Al Hilal's mammoth salary offer believed to be worth a staggering â¬700m. Bonkers, right? Absolutely. But, remarkably, it is feasible. Al Hilal could actually pull this off. Well, they wouldn't have made the offer if they couldn't afford it.  At the start of June, the country's ministry of sport revealed that the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF), who own a majority share in Newcastle, will be taking control of four Saudi Pro League clubs - widely regarded as the biggest four in the country: Al Hilal, Al Nassr, Al Ittihad, and Al Ahli. PIF now owns a 75% stake in each of these clubs, essentially topping them up with bottomless pits of cash.  Saudi's PIF retained its status as the sixth largest sovereign wealth fund on the planet earlier this year, with the latest data suggesting it boasts a net worth of $607.42bn. With no financial fair play rules to contend with, there's no questioning that Al Hilal could finance their proposed move for Mbappe, as ludicrous as it seems. Every Saudi Pro League club can register eight foreign players over the course of the season. Right now, Al Hilal's quota is full after they made three big name signings earlier this summer. If Mbappe accepts the club's proposal, Al Hilal will have to ditch one of their five other foreign players. Former West Brom star Matheus Pereira is on their books but spent last season out on loan, while they also boast former Porto forward Moussa Marega, South Korean international Jang Hyun-soo, former Sporting CP winger Andre Carillo and Brazilian striker Michael. The latter seems the most likely candidate for the chop, although Pereira did fall out of favour before his loan move away. The four clubs owned by PIF have all filled their foreign players quota ahead of the new season.  It doesn't appear as if Mbappe's potential move to Saudi Arabia will deny the Frenchman to chance to don Real Madrid colours in 2024.  While agreeing to sign for Al Hilal will obviously prevent him from joining this summer, Mbappe could sign a one-year deal with the Saudi Pro League club and move to Los Blancos on a free transfer next summer.  While there are multiple European clubs supposedly interested in signing Mbappe either this summer or next, including Barcelona, Mbappe has his heart set on a move to the Spanish capital. It's just a matter of when the move will happen, and how much richer he'll be by the time he ends up at the Bernabeu. Player Signed from Fee Ruben Neves Wolves â¬55m Sergej Milinkovic-Savic Lazio â¬40m Kalidou Koulibaly Chelsea â¬23m Al Hilal have parted ways with three foreign players to facilitate these moves. Luciano Vietto and Odion Ighalo departed as free agents, while Gustavo Cueller was sold to Al Shabab."
Every club linked with Kylian Mbappe - ranked,"Jul 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/every-club-linked-kylian-mbappe-ranked,"Kylian Mbappe's future has been the story of the 2023 transfer window, and on 24July we got the biggest development thus far.  90min understands that Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal have offered a world record Â£259m, with a Â£600m per annum salary, in order to sign the French superstar this summer.  Those are very, very, very big numbers.  Along with that bid, news also broke regarding interest from elsewhere too. Real Madrid, Liverpool, Barcelona, Chelsea, Manchester United, Inter and Tottenham (yep) have all also been linked.  So after processing all of this astonishing info, we at 90min have decided to rank the feasbility of a move to every club that have been linked with Mbappe:  Yes, Tottenham Hotspur have actually been cited with an interest in signing Mbappe this summer. Judging by their notorious frugality in the market there is considerable doubt that they'd fork out the necessary fee to sign Mbappe, and due to their failure to qualify for the UEFA Champions League, we doubt Mbappe would actually want to go there even if they splashed the clash. Still, Spurs fans it's ok to dream. Feasibility: 0/10  Inter recently walked away from talks over the permanent signing Romelu Lukaku due their unwillingness/inability to pay more that Â£30m for the Belgian striker. Therefore it is rather hard to imagine they'd consider matching Al Hilal's Â£259m bid for Mbappe this summer. The fact that they're at least in the UEFA Champions League makes this move ever-so-slightly more feasible than one to Tottenham. Feasibility: 1/10  #Mbappe2023? The whole of Liverpool Twitter was convinced that Mbappe was set to join their beloved club in 2020 and, as expected by everyone outside of the Liverpool Twitter bubble, that move didn't materialise. Now in 2023, although it would obviously be fun to have Mbappe on the books at Anfield, it would perhaps be wiser for the Reds to focus on signing new midfielders as opposed to a new forward. Feasibility: 3/10 A huge club in dire need of a superstar striker?In a lot of ways, a move to Manchester United makes sense for the 24-year-old. Unfortunately for all parties, however, any move likely would rely on a takeover of the club by either Sir Jim Ratcliffe or Qatar going through as soon as possible - something which does not seem likely at this stage. Feasibility: 5/10  feed Barcelona's monetary issues have been well documented in recent years, with the need to potentially sell players this summer in order to re-sign Lionel Messi being a key reason why that deal fell through. Now they're eyeing a move for the heir to Messi's 'greatest footballer in the world' throne. That doesn't quite add up, right? How can they afford that? How can they even think they can afford that? Well, according to L'Equipe, Xavi Hernandez's side are keen to swap a number of players with PSG in order to make a move happen and, depending on the players offered, that could be an enticing proposition for the Ligue 1 champions. Feasibility: 6/10 - A club keen to splash the cash? Check.- An owner looking to sign a superstar marquee name? Check.- One of the biggest clubs in the world? Check. So why only third on this list? A severe lack of UEFA Champions League football, that's why. Feasibility: 7/10  Al Hilal have made a world record bid of Â£259m to sign Mbappe, and offered the forward a rather astonishing pay packet of Â£600m to join the club for a single season.Yes, that is quite a lot of money...to say the very least. 90min understands that PSG are keen to accept this bid but are also aware that Mbappe may not be. And while he isn't currently keen, the fact that a move to the Saudi Pro League still leaves the door open for the French World Cup winner to join Real Madrid as a free agent in 2024 may be enough to convince him of joining the Saudi club. Feasibility: 9/10 The one club that Mbappe actually wants to sign for. Mbappe has his heart set on a move to Los Blancos. Be it this summer or next as a free agent, it's hard to imagine that the French superstar doesn't get his wish of playing for Real Madrid in the very near future. Feasibility: 10/10 "
How Twitter reacted to Al Hilal's world record offer for Kylian Mbappe,"Jul 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/how-twitter-reacted-to-al-hilal-world-record-offer-for-kylian-mbappe,"The Saudi Pro League has now firmly put its money where its mouth in ongoing efforts to shift the global balance of club football away from Europe. Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, even Lionel Messi - had he actually taken the offer, you can get your around and accept. These are the type of players whose best days are behind them and for whom an enormous pay day in Saudi Arabia is a nice, if morally questionable, retirement gift. N'Golo Kante, Roberto Firmino and Jordan Henderson were once top stars but won't be missed by the Premier League. At 26, Ruben Neves broke the trend of ageing players head to the Middle East, but the Portuguese midfielder is not exactly a global superstar. However, Kylian Mbappe is a different story altogether. News filtered through around Monday lunchtime in Europe that Al Hilal, one of the four clubs controlled by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, have made world record bid of Â£259m (â¬300m) that is considered to be 'serious'.

Al Hilal make world record offer for Kylian Mbappe,"Jul 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/al-hilal-make-world-record-offer-kylian-mbappe,"Al Hilal, one of four Saudi Pro League sides financed by the country's Public Investment Fund (PIF), have lodged a world-record bid for wantaway Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe, 90min understands. Mbappe was left out of PSG's pre-season squad after making it clear that he does intend to trigger the extension clause in his current contract, which runs until the summer of 2024. The Ligue 1 champions are desperate to avoid a situation where Mbappe can leave the club on a free transfer, and have made available him this summer. Contact has been made with a number of clubs across the globe, but it's shock interest from Saudi Arabia that could rock the footballing world. Sources have confirmed to 90min that PIF-backed Al Hilal have formalised an enormous offer worth â¬300m (Â£259m) that would make Mbappe the most expensive player ever - a fee that would shatter the record set by PSG's acquisition of Neymar for â¬222m (Â£198m) in 2017. PSG are prepared to accept the offer but the final decision will ultimately rest with Mbappe, who 90min understands is not keen on a move to the Middle East at this point in his career. feed Indeed, sources close to the Saudi side acknowledge that their proposal is unlikely to be approved by Mbappe who, as 90min revealed earlier this week, has his heart solely set on a move to Real Madrid in the future. Real Madrid's long-term interest in Mbappe remains and club president Florentino Perez is confident of having the Frenchman in his squad by 2024, when Mbappe will become a free agent if he does not sign an extension. A summer transfer to the Santiago Bernabeu has not been ruled out but Real Madrid are reluctant to pay a significant fee for a player who can be secured on a free transfer in just six months. PSG, while also leaving the door open to a contract extension for Mbappe, are looking to drum up interest in the 24-year-old from elsewhere in Europe in the hope of seeing clubs match their asking price of at least â¬200m (Â£172m)."
Man Utd poach Darren Fletcher's sons from Man City,"Jul 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-poach-darren-fletcher-sons-man-city,"Manchester United have persuaded the twin sons of technical director and former player Darren Fletcher to join the clubâs academy ranks from Manchester City, 90min can confirm. Fletcher was himself a United youth product, moving to Manchester from Scotland aged 11 tin 1995 to follow in the footsteps of players like Paul Scholes and David Beckham. He eventually left Old Trafford in 2015 after illness took its toll on his playing career at the very highest level, but stayed local to the area through spells with West Brom and Stoke, and returned to the club as a youth team coach in the autumn of 2020. Fletcher was promoted to first-team coach in early 2021, working alongside former teammate Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He was then appointed technical director just two months later. feed But despite Fletcherâs long association with United, his twin sons â Jack and Tyler, born in 2007 and recently turning 16, have been Manchester City academy players since their dad was walking out onto the Old Trafford turf each week. That is not actually unusual. The sons of Phil Neville, Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie have all played in Cityâs youth teams, although Harvey Neville did join United prior to going pro with Inter Miami, while Kai Rooney is currently tearing it up in a red shirt instead. In addition to Jack and Tyler Fletcher moving to United, 90min understands that the proposed deal to take academy prospect Harrison Parker in the opposite direction is also going through. The twins are due to turn 17 next March, at which point they will be able to sign professional terms with United. Jack and Tyler curiously represent different international sides. Jack has played for England at youth level, but Tyler has instead turned out for Scotland through his fatherâs heritage. They actually played against each other in an Under-16 game in February this year."
Kieran Tierney discusses Arsenal future amid Celtic links,"Jul 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/kieran-tierney-discusses-arsenal-future-celtic-links,"Kieran Tierney has admitted that decisions regarding his future at Arsenal are beyond his control, but he is keen to put the work in and isn't expecting to play every game. Tierney was a high profile arrival in 2019 when he completed a Â£25m switch from Celtic. But injuries and then increased competition following last summer's capture of Oleksandr Zinchenko have forced the Scotland international into more of a back-up or rotational role. Noting his lack of regular starts, a number of clubs have already shown interest in the player. 90min reported in March that Newcastle, West Ham and Aston Villa were monitoriing his situation. Brendan Rodgers, now back at Celtic, is also a big admirer, while had been interested prior to their relegation. But even potentially now the fourth choice left-back behind Zinchenko, Jakub Kiwior and Takehiro Tomiyasu, Tierney is willing to fight for regular playing time.  ""It's not really up to me [my future],"" Tierney said to media during Arsenal's pre-season tour.  ""I'm happy, I'm working hard every day and getting minutes. I'm just trying to do as well as I can."" feed When asked if he'd held conversations with Arteta regarding his future, the 26-year-old said: ""No. You can't play every single game, every single season, every single year. I don't expect that and I still made a lot of appearances last year. I was ready every game and working 100 per cent. I think everyone in there would agree with that, that I never give less than that whether I'm playing or not. ""In the games I did play I tried to do my best for the team. I came off the bench a lot last season, whether that was to see games out or help get a goal."" The return of the aforementioned Rodgers to Celtic has raised the possibility of a reunion in Glasgow. Rodgers previously played a huge role in Tierney's development during his first spell at Parkhead and hasn't ruled out the idea of working together again. ""There's been lots of players linked with here with me coming back. All I know is Kieran is like myself, we loved our time here,"" he said."
Al Hilal closing in on Aleksandar Mitrovic agreement with Fulham,"Jul 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/al-hilal-closing-in-on-aleksandar-mitrovic-agreement-with-fulham,"Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal are close to striking an agreement with Fulham to sign striker Aleksandar Mitrovic, 90min understands. Fulham have already knocked back two bids from Al Hilal for Mitrovic and had hoped to keep hold of the Serbian striker, who agreed personal terms with the Middle Eastern outfit weeks ago and is keen to make the move. Having seen an offer of Â£30m turned down, Al Hilal are now understood to have lodged a bid worth Â£50m which, as it stands, would represent a record for the Saudi Pro League. Discussions are ongoing between the two clubs and an agreement is close to being reached. Fulham have been preparing for the departure of Mitrovic and have already struck an agreement to sign Wolves' Raul Jimenez in his place. feed Fulham have already managed to fend off Saudi Arabian interest in manager Marco Silva, who has rejected an approach from Al Ahli and voiced his desire to keep hold of Mitrovic after the pre-season friendly against Brentford. ""Of course, if Mitrovic is my player I would like him to train, to be involved in all the moments with the team,"" Silva said. ""You know that, that I would like to have him participating in all the moments with the team."" With Mitrovic closing in on an exit, Fulham are also battling to keep hold of midfielder Joao Palhinha, who has been the subject of significant interest from West Ham. The Hammers, blessed with the Â£105m they received from selling Declan Rice to Arsenal, have seen two bids knocked back for Palhinha, the latest of which was worth Â£50m. Fulham want closer to Â£60m to offload the midfield enforcer. Elsewhere, Fulham have held talks with Chelsea over signing wantaway winger Callum Hudson-Odoi, who also has interest from Lazio."

Hudson-Odoi was left out of Chelsea's pre-season squad to continue negotiations over a move away from his boyhood club, with everyone involved ready to part ways with summer. The winger has attracted interest from across the globe but sources have confirmed to 90min that Lazio and Fulham have both ramped up conversations with Hudson-Odoi to try and get a deal done. Lazio attempted to steal an early march on proceedings by reaching out to the player at a time when Fulham's transfer plans were in limbo due to uncertainty surrounding manager Marco Silva, whose decision to reject Saudi Arabian side Al Ahli has now allowed the Cottagers to focus on new signings. The Serie A side are led by former Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri, who is keen on a reunion with Hudson-Odoi and can offer the 22-year-old the chance to play in the Champions League. feed Fulham, however, hope that the chance to remain in London will help them convince Hudson-Odoi to make the short trip from Stamford Bridge to Craven Cottage. With Silva now confirmed in place, Fulham have accelerated talks with Hudson-Odoi, who has managed 126 appearances for Chelsea since first making his debut during the 2017/18 campaign, and are pushing to get a deal done. Hudson-Odoi's entourage have also been spoken to by Crystal Palace but the Eagles have not advanced their interest at this point. Talks with Palace are completely separate to any negotiations over Frenchman Michael Olise, who has been earmarked for a return to Stamford Bridge this summer."

Tottenham owner makes decision on Harry Kane's future,"Jul 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-owner-makes-decision-harry-kane-future,"Tottenham Hotspur owner Joe Lewis does not want to lose Harry Kane for free in 2024 and has made his position clear to chairman Daniel Levy, 90min understands. Levy, who is employed by Lewis's ENIC Group to run Spurs, has been playing hardball with Kane in that he has not been willing to entertain any interest in his captain. However, Bahamas-based Lewis has made it clear to Levy that allowing Kane to leave on a free transfer in 12 months is not something he wants to see and has warned his chairman that the striker must be sold this summer if he does not agree to a contract extension. Kane's current deal is due to expire at the end of the coming campaign and, thus far, he has rebuffed Spurs' advances to sign a new deal, although in recent weeks Levy has made fresh approaches to his camp and made it clear he would be willing to make him the highest paid player in the Premier League. While Levy remains hopeful that Kane will be persuaded to sign a new deal, with new coach Ange Postecoglou key to those efforts, there is the option of selling him this summer and Bayern Munich are pushing hard to land the England star. Bayern, who have had two bids rejected already this summer, are determined to land Kane and believe that he does want to make the move to Munich this summer. 90min understands a third offer is set to come in. feed As it stands, Levy has refused to give a price to Bayern, despite them pushing hard and even holding face-to-face talks with him earlier this month, but German sources believe their next offer, which is set to be a club record deal worth around â¬100m (Â£86m), will bring the Tottenham supremo to the table. Concrete interest from elsewhere has yet to emerge this summer, with long-term suitors Manchester United, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid all looking at other targets at this point. Despite Lewis' demand to Levy that he sell Kane if no new deal is on the horizon, the final decision ultimately rests with the striker himself and sources close to the Englishman have been keen to highlight their position. Kane is now in a position in which he holds complete control of his future as he is able to agree a pre-contract in just six months and there is nothing Spurs can do to prevent that, but as Lewis has pointed out to Levy, they do not want that scenario to be played out."
"Chelsea, Man City and Arsenal eye Crystal Palace star Michael Olise","Jul 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-man-city-and-arsenal-eye-crystal-palace-star-michael-olise,"Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City are among the clubs who have registered an interest in Crystal Palace star Michael Olise, 90min understands.  The France Under-21 international signed for Palace back in July 2021, signing from Reading for Â£8.37m, and has quickly become one of the most talked about young players in the Premier League.  In his second full season with Crystal Palace, Olise became the youngest player to ever bag three assists in a single Premier League game - achieving the feat in a thumping 5-1 win over Leeds United - and also became the first Palace player to ever record over 10 assists in a single season in the top flight.  Olise's creativity has caught the eye of some of the top clubs in the Premier League, with sources confirming to 90min that Chelsea, Arsenal and treble-winners Man City have all expressed an interest in the player.  feed The Citizens have been in the market for a new right-sided midfielder during the current transfer window thanks to Riyad Mahrez's impending move to the Saudi Pro League. Along with Olise, City are also eyeing a potential bid for Olympique Lyonnais starlet Bradley Barcola.  Arsenal have also been in the market for a wide player this summer, with the likes of Ferran Torres making their shortlist along with Olise.  As things stand however, 90min can confirm that Chelsea are the most confident of getting a deal done for the talented attacking midfielder. That is in large part thanks to the fact that the club already have a relationship with the Olise family as Michael's younger brother, Richard Olise, is currently on the books at Stamford Bridge.  What may make a deal easier to strike between Palace and Chelsea is the release clause attached to Olise's current contract. The 21-year-old deal at Selhurst Park, which expires in 2026, is widely thought to have a Â£35m release clause in it.  Outside of the Premier League, 90min understands that Paris Saint-Germain also retain an interest in Olise. "
Fulham reject Â£50m West Ham offer for Joao Palhinha,"Jul 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/fulham-reject-50m-west-ham-offer-for-joao-palhinha,"Fulham have rejected a Â£50m bid from West Ham United for star midfielder Joao Palhinha, 90min understands.  The Hammers are in desperate need of quality midfield reinforcements this summer after selling their captain Declan Rice to Arsenal. Rice left the club earlier this month for a British record fee of Â£105m, leaving West Ham with a gaping hole in their midfield but with a huge transfer kitty to help fill it.  West Ham have targeted Fulham's Palhinha as a perfect replacement for Rice thanks to his stunning 2022/23 campaign. In his maiden Premier League season, the midfielder completed nearly 40 more tackles and interceptions in the division as he guided the Cottagers to 10th place in their first year back in the top flight.  90min understands that Fulham rejected an initial approach regarding the 28-year-old's availability last week, and they have now seen a follow up approach and bid of Â£50m also be rejected by the London club.  feed Sources have confirmed that Marco Silva's side are holding out for Â£60m in order to sell Palhinha, but the Hammers are unlikely to go higher than the Â£50m they have offered.  Alternatives option that West Ham have considered are Youssouf Fofana from Monaco, Manchester City's Kalvin Phillips, Everton's towering midfielder Amadou Onana and a potential loan deal with an option to buy for Denis Zakaria - who spent last season on loan at Chelsea from Juventus.  Without additions, David Moyes will be left with just Tomas Soucek and Flynn Downes as options deep in his Hammers midfield. "
