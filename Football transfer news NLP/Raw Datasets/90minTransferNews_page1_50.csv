Chelsea agree Romeo Lavia fee with Southampton,"Aug 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-agree-romeo-lavia-fee-southampton,"After striking a deal over a fee with the Saints, Chelsea set about finalising the terms of a move which sources have confirmed is worth around Â£58m including add-ons. Southampton director Jason Wilcox confirmed earlier on Tuesday that the two clubs were still in negotiations at that point, but just a few hours later, the Saints have shook hands with Chelsea and are bidding farewell to Lavia. Lavia is due to undergo a medical with Chelsea in the coming days ahead of putting pen to paper on another long-term contract at Stamford Bridge. The Belgian had the opportunity to join Liverpool this summer but, like Moises Caicedo, has opted to join Chelsea instead. feed Should all go to plan with his medical, Lavia will become the latest in a long list of new signings at Chelsea. Alongside Caicedo, the Blues have already recruited Axel Disasi, Christopher Nkunku, Nicolas Jackson, Lesley Ugochukwu, Angelo Gabriel, Robert Sanchez and Diego Moreira this summer, and they are not expected to finish there. Indeed, 90min understands Chelsea have agreed a deal to sign Crystal Palace midfielder Michael Olise, who has a Â£35m release clause in his contract with the Eagles. The Blues are then expected to turn their attention to a new goalkeeper to replace Kepa Arrizabalaga, who has joined Real Madrid on loan, while club officials have not yet ruled out pursuing another striker as well."
Harry Maguire's proposed West Ham transfer collapses,"Aug 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/harry-maguire-proposed-west-ham-transfer-collapses,"After telling Maguire he is free to leave Old Trafford this summer, Manchester United initially rejected a Â£30m bid from West Ham amid concerns over their ability to satisfy the centre-back's wage demands, only to eventually agree to the offer on the table. West Ham have since completed the signings of Edson Alvarez and James Ward-Prowse but talks over Maguire continued to drag on as they sought to thrash out a wage agreement with both the defender and United. 90min understands that Maguire had agreed the terms of a reduced contract with West Ham but sought a pay-off from United to compensate him for the loss in salary over the remaining two years of his deal at Old Trafford. Sources have now confirmed that no agreement was reached between Maguire and United, forcing West Ham to accept defeat in their pursuit of the centre-back. feed United had been preparing for Maguire's exit by speaking with Bayern Munich over French defender Benjamin Pavard but, as 90min revealed earlier this summer, the Red Devils fear they do not have the financial room to sign another defender with Maguire's high wages still on the books. There has been tentative interest in Maguire from elsewhere but United are not expecting more bids for the 30-year-old, who appears set to remain at Old Trafford beyond this summer. Manager Erik ten Hag is known to be happy to continue working with Maguire as a backup to Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez, but he recently warned the England international that he is in for a fight for minutes if he chooses to stay. Maguire remains under contract at United until 2025, with the club holding the option to extend his deal by a further 12 months."
Southampton director breaks down Chelsea & Liverpool's battle for Romeo Lavia,"Aug 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/southampton-director-breaks-down-chelsea-liverpool-battle-romeo-lavia,"Despite significant interest from Liverpool, Lavia is understood to have opted to join Chelsea this summer, following Ecuador midfielder Moises Caicedo in choosing Stamford Bridge over Anfield. Wilcox, who expects to see Lavia's move sealed this week, offered fans at the BBC Solent Fansâ Forum an insight into the complicated negotiations with both Liverpool and Chelsea. ""I think you know, it's well known that we've had some significant interest in Romeo, we've had an offer which we accepted from Liverpool,"" Wilcox began. ""Then Chelsea came to the table. So we're currently in negotiation with Chelsea now so it's a real tricky period for Romeo. But I'm confident that something will get done in the next week or so or in the next few days. ""And I think, you know, when we look at what Romeo's achieved here, I think every one of us here wouldn't want to lose him but the reality is, we're in the Championship and we need to reinvest and by buying Shea Charles, we've got another one who hopefully we can do the same with. ""So good luck to Romeo. Let's say it's not done yet. But we envisage in the next few days it will be completed."" feed With a move for Lavia almost wrapped up, 90min understands that Chelsea have now turned their attention to concluding a deal for Crystal Palace's Michael Olise. As for Liverpool, the search for midfield reinforcements continues. Jurgen Klopp has already signed Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai but the surprise departures of Jordan Henderson and Fabinho have left the Reds short. Leeds United's Tyler Adams is understood to be on Liverpool's radar. Chelsea had been in talks with the United States international but the Blues opted to focus on Caicedo and Lavia instead."
Neymar completes move from PSG to Al Hilal,"Aug 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/neymar-completes-move-psg-hilal,"90min understands that the Saudi Arabian club have paid â¬90m (Â£77.6m) for the 31-year-old's services, brining an end to his six-year stay at PSG. The Ligue 1 club made Neymar the most expensive footballer in history back in 2017, signing the player for Â£190m.  While the Brazilian won five Ligue 1 titles in Paris, he struggled with a number of muscle injuries throughout his time at the club, failing to make more than 22 league appearances in any of his six campaigns with the club.  Speaking to PSG's official website, club chairman and CEO Nasser Al-Khelaifi said: ""It is inevitably difficult to say goodbye to a legend of the Club, which Neymar will be forever. I will never forget the day he arrived at Paris Saint-Germain, nor what he brought to our club and our project over the past six years. ""We have lived extraordinary moments and Neymar will always be part of our history. I would like to thank him and his family. We wish Neymar the best for the future and his next adventure.""  manual Neymar has put pen to paper on a two-year deal in Saudi Arabia, and has picked the number 10 jersey to wear at Al Hilal.  Talks also remain on between PSG and Al Hilal over midfielder Marco Verratti, who could reunite with Neymar in the Middle East if the two clubs can agree on a fee. Al Hilal have been incredibly active in the transfer market so far this summer, bringing in Kalidou Koulibaly, Ruben Neves, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Malcom already."
How Moises Caicedo fee compares to most expensive signings in football history,"Aug 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/how-moises-caicedo-fee-compares-most-expensive-signings-football-history,"Years before Chelsea began peppering Brighton with dizzying offers only to be outbid by Liverpool, before the Blues bid Â£115m to secure his services this week, Caicedo was the subject of a multi-club tussle while he was still in Ecuador with Independiente del Valle. Manchester United, AC Milan, Brighton, Chelsea and Belgian side Club Brugge were all interested in the midfielder after a rapid ascension in senior South American football. Three separate agencies also tried to represent Caicedo and get a slice of any potentially lucrative deal. Ultimately, Brighton cut through the chaos to snag Caicedo for just Â£4.5m in 2021. After less than 50 starts for the Seagulls, the 21-year-old has now become one of the most expensive players in the history of the sport. Here's how Caicedo's Â£115m move to Chelsea compares to the game's other costly sagas. Chelsea confirmed the signing of Caicedo after one of the most dramatic transfer sagas of recent times. The Blues had been pursuing the midfielder for the majority of the summer, however had been unwilling to make a bid over Â£80m until Liverpool agreed to fork out Â£111m for his services.  Despite an agreement between Liverpool and Brighton being struck, Caicedo was unwilling to agree to a move to Anfield, opening the door for Chelsea to swoop in and have a Â£115m bid accepted for his services.  The midfielder has now put pen to paper on an eight-year deal at Stamford Bridge.  Caicedo has become the most expensive signing for Chelsea and any other British club. But where does he rank on a global scale? Ranking Player Signed Joined Fee 1 Neymar 2017 PSG Â£198m 2 Kylian Mbappe 2018 PSG Â£163m 3 Philippe Coutinho 2018 Barcelona Â£142m 4 Ousmane Dembele 2017 Barcelona Â£135m 5 Moises Caicedo 2023 Chelsea Â£115m 6 Joao Felix 2019 Atletico Madrid Â£113m 7 Enzo Fernandez 2023 Chelsea Â£107m 8 Antoine Griezmann 2019 Barcelona Â£107m 9 Declan Rice 2023 Arsenal Â£105m 10 Jack Grealish 2021 Manchester City Â£100m Less than four years after making his senior debut as a 17-year-old in the Ecuadorian top flight, Caicedo has become the fifth most expensive footballer of all time.  Even though Caicedo's fee has scratched nine digits, Neymar's move to PSG comfortably remains the most expensive in history, with the Ligue 1 giants paying Â£198m for the forward's services.  Neymar's PSG teammate Kylian Mbappe is second on the list but could have moved into top spot after Al Hilal's Â£259m offer was accepted by the French champions. Mbappe ultimately refused to even meet with representatives of the Saudi giants. Caicedo has cost Chelsea marginally more than Atletico Madrid splashed out on Joao Felix in 2019. Not entirely surprisingly, an elfin forward without a fixed position struggled to adapt to Diego Simeone's defence first (second and third) approach in the Spanish capital. After a failed loan spell at Chelsea in the second half of last season, Felix has spent an icy pre-season on the fringes at Atletico. In the same January window that Felix arrived at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea broke the British transfer record to extricate Enzo Fernandez from Benfica. The 22-year-old has followed a similarly stratospheric rise to prominence, arguably eclipsing Caicedo's ascent by winning the World Cup 18 months after his top-flight debut.  The Blues have now broken their own transfer record to sign Caicedo. "
Chelsea closing in on Michael Olise signing,"Aug 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-closing-in-on-michael-olise-signing,"Arsenal and Manchester City were both intrigued by news of a Â£35m release clause in Olise's contract but, as 90min reported last month, Chelsea have long been confident they would win the race for his signature. Talks over personal terms have been ongoing for weeks and now sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea have taken a step forward in their negotiations with Palace as they seek to get an agreement over the line. Olise, who can play both in midfield and out on the wing, spent several years in the Chelsea academy before leaving aged 14, while his brother Richard, 18, is part of the Blues' Under-21 setup currently. feed Chelsea hope to finalise Olise's signing soon but are in no rush to do so as the 21-year-old is currently sidelined with a hamstring injury he picked up at this summer's Under-21 European Championships. Olise is not expected to return to the pitch until the end of September at the earliest so there is no imminent deadline to get the Frenchman registered for any upcoming fixtures, unlike midfielder Romeo Lavia, whose transfer from Southampton could be completed in time for the Belgian to face West Ham United on Sunday alongside fellow new arrival Moises Caicedo. 90min understands that Chelsea are expected to end their midfield rebuild once the moves for Lavia and Olise are finalised, with the Blues set to switch their attention to finding a goalkeeper to replace Kepa Arrizabalaga, who joined Real Madrid on loan and admitted during his presentation that he wants to stay in Spain beyond this season. A new striker is also a possibility for Chelsea, who lost Christopher Nkunku to a knee injury for the next four months.  Nicolas Jackson has impressed up top for Mauricio Pochettino's side, but Chelsea are otherwise short in attack as 21-year-old Armando Broja is still pushing to return from an ACL injury. Academy striker Mason Burstow was on the bench for the season-opener against Liverpool."
Chelsea midfielder seals loan exit,"Aug 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-midfielder-seals-loan-exit,"Casadei spent the 2022/23 campaign on loan in the same division with Reading, making 15 appearances and scoring one goal.  The midfielder has recently caught the eye much more at Under-20 level for Italy, winning the Golden Ball and Golden Boot awards for his stunning performances in the FIFA Under-20 World Cup. In Italy's run to the final - a final they'd lose to Uruguay 1-0 - Casadei managed a thoroughly impressive seven goals in seven games.  With Chelsea confirming the British record signing of Moises Caicedo this week and also closing in on Romeo Lavia from Southampton, the Italian midfielder has now secured a loan to Leicester in order to get some game time under his belt.  feed Speaking to the Foxes' official website after making the move, Casadei said: ""I feel really good. Iâm really happy to be here, Iâm excited and I canât wait to get started. Obviously, Leicester is a big team so Iâm here to win and to do as well as possible to fight and to work hard for this team."" In a statement released by Chelsea, the club's co-sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley added: ""This loan move is the perfect opportunity for Cesare to continue his progression as an exciting, young footballer. ""Weâre excited to see how he performs under Enzo Maresca at Leicester and look forward to watching him continue on this journey."""
Moises Caicedo: Brighton CEO admits surprise at Liverpool snub,"Aug 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/moises-caicedo-brighton-ceo-surprise-liverpool-snub,"Chelsea confirmed the Â£115m signing of Caicedo on Monday after a tense weekend which began with Liverpool coming out of nowhere to agree a fee of Â£111m to sign the Ecuador international. However, Caicedo soon made it clear that he would prefer a move to Stamford Bridge, urging Brighton to reopen negotiations with Chelsea and ultimately sealing the move he was looking for. Barber admitted to talkSPORT that Caicedo's stance left Brighton in an unexpected and ""difficult"" situation as they tried to find an outcome which satisfied everyone. feed ""Liverpool are a fantastic club, youâd imagine anyone would be running up the M6 for the chance to play at Anfield, but for whatever reason, Moises and his advisors decided London was their preferred destination,"" he said. ""In that situation weâre in a difficult position; weâve negotiated a British record deal deal and spent several days working with Liverpool, who were were professional throughout. ""At that point [when Caicedo rejected the move], weâre out of the loop, it is all between the player and Liverpool. When it became clear he isnât going to be joining Liverpool, we have to go into a different mode, we then have to do it all again, which we did. ""We started working with Chelsea, and we had to protect our own interests which is the player. We did that and now Moises goes on to the next step in his career."" Liverpool and Chelsea have also butted heads over Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia who, like Caicedo, has opted to move to Stamford Bridge this summer."
Kepa Arrizabalaga reveals desire to seal permanent Real Madrid transfer,"Aug 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/kepa-arrizabalaga-desire-seal-permanent-real-madrid-transfer,"After Thibaut Courtois went down with a serious knee injury, Madrid began searching for a new goalkeeper and eventually settled on Kepa, who joined on Monday in a loan deal which does not include the option for Madrid to make the move permanent. Even though there is no purchase clause in Kepa's loan contract, the 28-year-old made it clear he is looking to stay in Madrid for the foreseeable future. ""I really hope Real Madrid will keep me at the end of the season,"" he told a press conference when asked if he wants to stay at Madrid. ""Today is the first day of my assignment. We have time, we'll see.

Arsenal confirm signing of David Raya on loan from Brentford,"Aug 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-confirm-signing-david-raya-loan-brentford,"The Gunners allowed previous deputy Matt Turner to join Nottingham Forest earlier this month and have now replaced him with the in-demand Raya. A small loan fee has been paid and 90min understands Arsenal also have the option to buy Raya permanently for a total package of Â£30m. Sporting director Edu told the club's official website: ""We welcome David to us on a season-long loan from Brentford.  ""David is a top-quality goalkeeper, who has consistently performed to a high level with Brentford in the Premier League. With David joining us we are adding quality and depth to our squad so we can perform at the highest possible level in all competitions."" Raya, who has been handed the number 22 shirt last worn by Pablo Mari during the 2021/22 campaign, signed a new two-year contract with Brentford before making the move, with the Bees also holding the option to extend that by a further 12 months. feed Raya, who was also wanted by Bayern Munich and had interest from a number of other top Premier League sides, will now compete with current number one Aaron Ramsdale for a spot in Mikel Arteta's lineup. ""Bring it on,"" Ramsdale told ITV of the competition before Raya's move was finalised. ""Nothing comes easy in football.  ""But also at the same time you need to move along and adapt as well. I've done it to other people when I've moved to clubs. I'm not going to be thinking that it's never going to happen to me. So, yeah, I think if it happens, it happens and then we'll fight and we'll make each other the best version of ourselves because that's what the manager is telling us as well. ""I'm sure whoever plays, me, Matt, whoever comes in, the goalkeeping union, people will laugh at but it's a real thing, and your individual disappointment will go away and you'll put the team first and you'll put that goalkeeper first as well."""
Every time British transfer record broken in Premier League era,"Aug 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/every-time-british-transfer-record-broken-premier-league-era,"Lucrative broadcasting rights, commercial deals and other premium sponsorship means clubs are richer than ever, particularly if they have happen to being playing in the Premier League. The biggest transfers seen in world football may have happened around continental Europe, sure, but the level of spending in England, and regularity of it, is at an all-time high. And with Moises Caicedo's Â£115m move from Brighton to Chelsea now complete, the British transfer record has been smashed a whopping 19 times since the Premier League's inception in 1992. Here's every player and move to hold that accolade... Alan Shearer had only scored 23 goals in 118 appearances for Southampton by the time he left for Blackburn Rovers in 1992 - an average a goal just over every five games. But the soon-to-be Premier League winners, who had earned their place in the top flight via the second tier play-offs, knew exactly what they were getting with Shearer. A player who finish with both feet, bury headers for fun, and smash them in from close range and from long distance. Not even Blackburn could have imagined Shearer's time at Ewood Park to go as well as it did, mind you. He scored 112 goals for the club four seasons - one of those was severely disrupted by injury - and scored over 30 in each of his final three, including lifting the title in 1995. One of Sir Alex Ferguson's greatest pieces of work was nipping in ahead of Blackburn, who were being bankrolled by multi-millionaire Jack Walker, to sign Roy Keane for Manchester United. It was a genuine move from Ferguson as Keane spearheaded United's domination of the Premier League for the next decade -  the Irishman establishing himself at the very top of the game in terms of performance level and leadership qualities. Seven Premier League crowns and five appearances in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year tells you all you need to know. Fresh from scoring 25 goals for Norwich City in the 1993/94 Premier League season, Chris Sutton was picked up by Blackburn for Â£4m to partner Shearer up front. The transfer was an immediate success as the dynamic duo, flanked by Stuart Ripley and Jason Wilcox on the wings, scored goals for fun to steer Rovers to the title on the final day of the season. Sutton stayed at the club for further four years, bagging a career-best 18 league goals in Blackburn colours during the 1997/98 season. If you're of a certain age, you'll know the saying 'Cole score goals'. Sir Alex Ferguson and Manchester United certainly knew it, which is why they decided to fork out Â£7m to sign Cole from Newcastle United in January 1995, including send Keith Gillespie the other way. He scored 12 in 18 during his first half season in red and another 81 across the next six years. Multiple Premier League titles followed as a result, with Cole's superb lob over Ian Walker to secure the 1998/99 crown one of his finer moments. Dennis Bergkamp arrived at Arsenal to huge fanfare in 1995 and it didn't take the Dutchman long to drag the club out of the mid-table doldrums. Under the management of Arsene Wenger, Bergkamp helped transform the Gunners into genuine title contenders, forming a deadly partnership up front with Ian Wright while linking up with the brilliant Marc Overmars on the wing. Arsenal won the Premier League title in 1997/98, 2001/02 and 2003/04, with Bergkamp's contributions earning him a statue outside the Emirates Stadium. ""Collymore closing in!"" is among the most iconic lines of commentary in Premier League history. It was uttered by Martin Tyler, former voice of Sky Sports, in the final moments of the iconic 4-3 thriller between Liverpool and Newcastle in April 1996. It also had a defining impact on that season's title race, costing Newcastle in their fierce battle with Manchester United. Collymore's rise had been rapid to the say the least. He had struggled to make an impact in the top flight as a teenager with Crystal Palace, before joining Nottingham Forest in the second tier afetr a spell at Southend. He then took his prolific lower league form into the Premier League and was poached by Liverpool for a British record fee after just one season (and 22 goals). Alan Shearer's move to boyhood club Newcastle in 1996 wasn't just a British record transfer, it was a world record too - the Â£15m deal surpassed the Â£13.2m that Barcelona paid to PSV Eindhoven for Brazilian prodigy Ronaldo only weeks earlier that same summer. Manchester United were also very keen on Shearer too, but were famously to the deal. Most thought it was Shearer's desire to join his home town team, who had narrowly missed out on the 1995/96 Premier League title and played some of the best football in the country under Kevin Keegan. But then Manchester United chairman has claimed in more recent years there was more to it. ""Shearer had been to Alex Ferguson's house, spoke to him and assured him he wanted to come [to Manchester],"" Edwards said on a podcast while promoting a book in 2019. ""The problem, I think, was with the chairman of Blackburn, Jack Walker, who was not a great fan of Manchester United...local rivals, both Lancashire clubs. He did not want Alan Shearer to come to Manchester United. Shearer was quite close to Walker, who was like a father figure to him, and I don't think Alan wanted to upset him by coming to United. And I'm not sure Jack would have let him come anyway, whereas he was happy for Alan to go to Newcastle, I don't think that was a threat to him."" Shearer went on to score 206 goals in 10 years at Newcastle, breaking the club's all-time record previously held for decades by Jackie Milburn. Leeds made Rio Ferdinand the world's most expensive defender when they paid Â£18m to West Ham in the final weeks of 2000. The club's overspending would later lead to their financial demise, but the good times briefly rolled with Ferdinand dressed in all-white at the back. A few months after his arrival in west Yorkshire, the centre-back scored a famous goal in a Champions League quarter-final demolition of Deportivo La Coruna. His presence also coincided with a massive upturn in their domestic form, losing just two Premier League games in the second half of 2000/01 after a poor start to the campain. Manchester United had initially agreed to sign Ruud van Nistelrooy in 2000, only for the transfer to fall through over concerns about fitness. The Dutch stiker then suffered a dreaded ACL injury during a PSV Eindhoven training session, but United were still prepared to shell out a record fee in 2001. His goalscoring was immediate, netting twice on his Premier League debut and scoring 36 in all competitions on his first season, upping that number to 44 in his second. Van Nistelrooy finished his United career in 2006 with 150 goals in 219 games, an average of 30 per season, but is arguably an underrated part of the club's modern history because of what the likes of Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo went on to achieve in the years that immediately followed. ""I used to get excited when the club would sign a big player because thatâs the nature of the game. Veron came to the club, he was an excellent player, okay it didnât work out for him at United, but he was an excellent player,"" Roy Keane said in 2020, looking back on Juan Sebastian's two seasons at Manchester United. Veron signed for United having developed a lofty reputation thanks to his exploits in Serie A with Parma and Lazio. There was initial promise, that's for sure, and the Argentine particularly enjoyed the European nights, but struggled to cope with the physical demands of an entire Premier League season without a fixed role in the team. Injuries compromised his second season at Old Trafford after a promising start to the campaign, and United opted to cut their losses and sell to Chelsea in 2003. Undeterred by Veron's struggles, United broke the British record again the following summer, although Ferdinand's familiarity with the English game perhaps rendered his Â£29.3m arrival from Leeds substantially less of a risk.  Sir Alex Ferguson never doubted Rio's capacity to become one of the world's best in his position - his displays for England at the 2022 World Cup did that opinion no harm - and he rapidly developed into a stalwart of United's defence. Frighteningly quick and unerringly cool in possession, Ferdinand was the ultimate modern-day centre-back. He enjoyed a stellar 12-year career at Old Trafford, lifting six Premier League trophies and the Champions League in 2008. He's recognised as one of England's greatest defenders and a modern Manchester United legend.  It took a little while for Ferdinand's record to go, but smashed it was in the summer of 2006 as Chelsea prised former Ballon d'Or winner Andriy Shevchenko away from AC Milan.  The former Dynamo Kyiv hotshot emerged as one of the world's most potent forwards during his time in Lombardy. Shevchenko departed Milan as their second leading scorer of all-time and with a Champions League medal in his back pocket, and the Ballon d'Or on his mantelpiece. However, the Ukrainian striker struggled to adjust to life in west London. His two years at Chelsea were rather forgettable. He scored here and there, and only rarely did he put together a sustained run of form. The striker's apex was in the rearview mirror, that's for sure, and he returned to Milan on loan for the 2008/09 season before eventually settling back in Kyiv. This signing ignited the revolution that culminated in Manchester City blossoming into the Premier League's supreme force. On the same day City were bought out by the Abu Dhabi United Group, they quickly went to work and signed Brazilian star Robinho from Real Madrid for a British record Â£32.5m. City had been haggling Reggina and Portsmouth for the additions of Rolando Bianchi and Benjani respectively in the preceding months, now they were negotiating with Europe's elite. Money talks. Supposedly persuaded by City's Brazilian contingent that included former Santos teammate Elano, Robinho signed up for the project in Manchester and made an immediate difference. His first season at the club was superb as he ended the 2008/09 as the Premier League's fourth-highest goalscorer with 14. However, things quickly turned sour for the maverick attacker as injuries reduced his significance dramatically in year two. Discontent and perhaps fed up of listening to Mark Hughes, Robinho returned to Santos on loan in January 2010 and was never seen again in Manchester. Panic or sheer recruiting incompetence? Either way, Torres was never going to live up to his Â£50m price tag at Stamford Bridge.  The Spaniard was no longer the phenom that took the Premier League by storm at Liverpool, with injuries reducing his explosiveness and rendering him a nondescript threat. Torres was forced to evolve and while the striker that rocked up at Chelsea was a shell of his peak-self, he remained somewhat useful. He was never prolific for the Blues during his three-and-a-half years at the club, but he did score one of the most memorable goals in Chelsea's history away at Barcelona in the 2011/12 Champions League semi-finals. For that, many supporters overlooked his mammoth price tag. The ultimate maverick. A youthful but ambitious Pogba departed Manchester United for greater first-team opportunities overseas in 2012 and ended up at Juventus.  The Frenchman dazzled during his four years in Turin, swiftly evolving into the personification of a highlight reel and a bona fide superstar. Given his prestige, it was going to cost an arm and a leg for United to bring the midfielder 'home'. But they did exactly that in 2016, handing Juve Â£89m for his services. Now, summarising Pogba's second stint at United is rather tricky. While the conclusion was somewhat sombre, the Frenchman did enjoy some scintillating runs of form at Old Trafford. However, it's fair to say he couldn't quite justify United's massive outlay to bring him back, especially given that he eventually left for nothing (again) when he re-signed for Juve in 2022. Considering their riches, it's pretty remarkable that City only appear on this list twice. Nevertheless, they made Grealish the first-ever Englishman to garner a Â£100m fee in 2021.  The marvellous Brummie playmaker had put Aston Villa on his back during the 2019/20 season to keep the Villans in the Premier League, and a move away became increasingly inevitable after a fine 2020/21 campaign. City bit the bullet and acquired Grealish for a record fee after triggering his release clause, but it took the wide man a little while to find his feet at the Etihad. Adjusting to Pep Guardiola's demands is never easy, and Grealish struggled to flourish in his debut season. But he excelled in year two and played an underrated role in City's historic treble triumph. Overpriced, they said. Haha.  Convinced by his talent after an excellent 2022 World Cup with winners Argentina, Chelsea made a big splash in the January transfer window and signed Fernandez for a whopping Â£106.8m. Despite his stellar form in Qatar during the winter, eyebrows were ubiquitously raised given the midfielder's relative inexperience of European football.  He'd arrived at Benfica just six months prior.  Nevertheless, Fernandez stuck out for all the right reasons during his first few months in west London. He tried his utmost to ensure Chelsea looked competent, but not even he could salvage the Blues.  A controller, playmaker and potentially a final third producer all wrapped into one elegant midfield operator, Fernandez is set to take the Premier League by storm under Mauricio Pochettino at Stamford Bridge. Finding a suitable midfield partner for Fernandez was one of Chelsea's key objectives in the 2023 summer transfer window, and they finally got their man.  Sure, it might've taken yet another British record fee to acquire their desired midfield target, but Moises Caicedo's potential alongside Fernandez renders the outlay somewhat measured given the tandem's projected dynamic. The Ecuadorian's work on the south coast saw him develop into one of the Premier League's most sought-after assets with Liverpool, Arsenal, and, of course, Chelsea all taking interest. Keen to get as much money as they can for their dominant ball-winning midfielder, Brighton eventually sold for a whopping Â£115m fee. feed"

But sources have confirmed to 90min that Bayern have communicated to United that they're looking for â¬40m plus add-ons for Pavard, much to the chagrin of the 13-time Premier League winners. Pavard is said to be unimpressed with Bayern's change in stance, with personal terms agreed in principle over a move to Old Trafford, with United also surprised by the moving of the goalposts. feed Talks are ongoing between the two parties, with United in particular keen to find a resolution, but Bayern's inability to land Kyle Walker from Manchester City means the Bundesliga giants could change their stance entirely on a potential sale. Jean-Clair Todibo, Perr Schuurs, Jarrad Branthwaite, Edmond Tapsoba and Benficaâs Antonio Silva are other options being considered by United, as they bid to strengthen the depth of Erik ten Hag's squad, though they don't offer the same positional versatility that Pavard does. To add fuel to the rumour fire, Pavard liked an Instagram post from United's official Instagram account that celebrated Raphael Varane's winner against Wolves on Monday night - though the two are international teammates and are known to be close friends. United have signed Andre Onana, Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund for significant transfer fees this summer, also adding Jonny Evans to their squad on a short-term deal. There have also been a number of outgoing this summer, with David de Gea and Freed the most high-profile exits to date.

Eric Dier wanted by clubs across Europe & Saudi Arabia as Tottenham consider sale,"Aug 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/eric-dier-wanted-clubs-europe-saudi-arabia-tottenham-consider-sale,"Dier has less than one year left to run on his Spurs contract but an agreement over an extension has not been reached and is not believed to be close. 90min were first to report back in June that Tottenham would be open to selling Dier as he was not in the immediate plans of new head coach Ange Postecoglou. The 29-year-old was left out of Spurs' matchday squad for their Premier League opening day draw at Brentford on Sunday, with Postecoglou revealing this was a tactical decision as Dier was fully fit. He was also omitted from the Greek-Australian's new-look leadership group despite playing a prevalent role under previous managers.

Dier, who grew up in Portugal from the age of seven, admitted last year that he would like to play abroad again, and 90min understands he could get his wish. Former side Sporting CP would contemplate a reunion if they were to sell in-demand defender Goncalo Inacio in the next few weeks, while Lisbon rivals Benfica are also monitoring Dier in case their own highly-rated centre-back Antonio Silva leaves. However, it is likely that both clubs will keep hold of their homegrown stars for the time being. feed Ligue 1 side Monaco, who have been linked with Fulham defender and Tottenham target Tosin Adarabioyo, have asked Tottenham about the availability of Dier, as have a number of Bundesliga teams. Closer to home, London neighbours Crystal Palace and Scottish champions Celtic are believed to be admirers of Dier. There is also pressing interest in Dier from Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, who already have the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Sadio Mane on their books. Unlike Dier's other suitors, they would be able to pay Spurs a more generous transfer fee, with European clubs looking for a cut-price deal. Dier joined Tottenham from Sporting back in 2014 and was one of their first signings under Mauricio Pochettino. He spent much of his debut season playing at right-back or centre-back before being moved into midfield under the Argentine. Since Spurs hired Jose Mourinho in 2019, Dier has almost exclusively played in his preferred centre-back role. He's played 361 games in all competitions for the Lilywhites."

Chelsea 1-1 Liverpool: So who needs Moises Caicedo more?,"Aug 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-1-1-liverpool-who-needs-moises-caicedo-more,"The Brighton midfielder will become the most expensive player in Premier League history when he does eventually transfer, at some point in the coming week, you'd expect, with Liverpool initially having an offer accepted of Â£111m for the Ecuadorian.  Caicedo has made his decision known that he'd prefer the move to west London, triggering public embarrassment for Liverpool - a club usually so efficient and proficient with their dealings to buy and sell first team players.  feed Caicedo wasn't there, but good grief did both teams want him to be, with the need for a dominating defensive midfielder desperately obvious for both throughout a frantic, chaotic 101 minutes of opening weekend action. But what did Sunday's game tell us about which team more desperately needs to break the British transfer record to sign a player with only 53 appearances in English football to his name? Liverpool might need a defensive midfielder, will try to confirm as and when pic.twitter.com/gg4CVUB0wd At least new Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino settled for pragmatism (in look and feel at least) as he attempted to cover the lack of defensive presence in midfield by naming a back three. Axel Disasi was named for a competitive debut alongside returning loanee Levi Colwill, with Thiago Silva relied upon in the middle. It suggested at least he was looking to stem the tide and not give too much away - though insisted post-match that his team played with four at the back. For Jurgen Klopp, it was back to gung-ho and heavy metal. You'd suppose you can't name a six in your team if you don't possess one, but Klopp went down the route of ""screw it"" with his team sheet, naming new signings Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister alongside Cody Gakpo in the most attacking of midfield units.  Mac Allister was tasked with being the deepest midfielder, operating with Trent Alexander-Arnold drifting in from the right full back slot. Caicedo is largely praised for his ability to cover ground, shuttling across to cover spaces left behind his teammates with the licence to attack. Fair to say both teams could have really utilised him here - first half especially - and that whichever team gets him will have a gem for next decade in a dream scenario. The opening 45 was a story of Pure, Unadulterated Barclays: Chaos Edition, with both teams' defences breached. Liverpool fired a warning after 12 minutes when Mohamed Salah struck the bar, but hit the front before the 20th minute after some excellent work from the Egyptian. Chelsea left far too much space for Salah to take possession and far too much space behind their back line for Luis Diaz to tap in at the far post. Plenty at fault but good defensive midfielders stop breakaways at source. There'd have been little Caicedo could've done about the way Chelsea's equaliser came about - this was a story of space behind the back line and defenders switching off - but both teams had the ball in the net on a further occasion each only to see efforts ruled out for offside. In the second half, Conor Gallagher far better embraced the role he'd been given for the day as a midfield screen, while 90min POTM Enzo Fernandez grew in stature throughout with an imperious performance in possession. It meant the hosts shaded the second half, controlled the lions' share of possession and the chaos of the game had subsided...barring a frantic final few minutes. WhoScored have Chelsea's pass completion at 88% compared to the visitors' 80%, but that could have something to do with Liverpool's direct style on the day and push to get the ball forward. There were spells throughout the first half and before Chelsea found their feet where Liverpool were cutting the hosts open with direct passes through the middle and through the channels, but over the course of the game Chelsea stomped it out. The Blues themselves found moments to penetrate with vertical passes through the middle and often threatened with charges up the pitch from players in possession - they could have won the match late on following a break in that manner. You'd have to chalk Chelsea's name on the board for better use of the ball today on the whole; namely because Enzo Fernandez is very good at football. But both teams have holes to fill. During his time at Brighton, Caicedo was often seen covering in the absence of others at right back - and players nowadays - especially those who cost north of Â£100m - are hugely valued for versatility. Chelsea won't need that kind of cover given their options at right-sided centre back and with Malo Gusto joining the party over the summer and with Reece James named as club captain. Chelsea do need options and numbers in midfield but Caicedo's name is a dream scenario and the completion of a midfield unit. Liverpool, meanwhile, only have 18-year-old Stefan Bajcetic as a natural presence in defensive midfield - and nobody else following the sales of Fabinho and Jordan Henderson, while they rely on Ibrahima Konate to cover three or four positions when Alexander-Arnold steps into midfield and Liverpool don't have the ball. The Reds are in desperate need of a defensive presence in the centre and it would add levels to their game very quickly if they found the right fit. Based on the evidence of today - from Jurgen Klopp's decision to play Alexis Mac Allister at six while he wore 10 on his back, from Mauricio Pochettino's decision to use a 3-5-2, from the second half performances of Conor Gallagher and Enzo Fernandez and from the apparent ease for opposing teams to progress through Liverpool's centre, you'd have to say it's Liverpool. Their bid has been accepted by Brighton but advances have been halted by the player, with Chelsea now primed to step in and complete the transfer in the week to come. They may even sign up Southampton's Romeo Lavia to really take the biscuit - though Klopp's team are to fight to the end on that one too with no decision from the player yet. If Chelsea do manage to secure their top target for the summer, they'll have a midfield unit of Caicedo and Enzo which will be the envy of the Premier League for seasons to come. It'll have cost in the region of Â£220m for the two, but if you're going for best in class, you've got to spend."
Liverpool prepared to match Chelsea offer for Romeo Lavia,"Aug 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-prepared-to-match-chelsea-offer-romeo-lavia,"The two clubs have already been at war over Brighton & Hove Albionâs Moises Caicedo in recent days. Chelsea have been pursuing the Ecuador international for months, but it was Liverpool who first agreed a deal with Brighton for a British record fee of Â£111m on Friday. Even then, it remained Caicedoâs preference to join Chelsea and the Blues, who had not previously offered more than Â£80m, refused to throw in the towel. As it stands, Chelsea are now confident of finalising an agreement with Brighton in excess of the Liverpool offer already accepted. But Caicedo wasnât the only player that Chelsea looked set to beat Jurgen Kloppâs team to. feed Liverpool, in need of midfielders after letting Jordan Henderson, Fabinho, Naby Keita, James Milner and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all leave this summer, had earlier seen three bids for Lavia rejected by Southampton â they had been holding out for Â£50m, with Liverpoolâs best offer totalling Â£45m. Suddenly, Chelsea came on the scene and submitted a Â£48m bid for Lavia before raising that offer to Â£55m - a fee which left the Blues confident of getting a deal done. 90min now understands that Liverpool are ready to make a fourth Lavia offer that matches Chelseaâs bid for the 19-year-old Belgian, who has played only 36 senior club games in his career. As far as Southampton are concerned, they are happy with the developments and keen to see how this bidding war between Chelsea and Liverpool plays out. Lavia, meanwhile, is yet to make known his preference one way or the other, having held positive talks with both clubs."
PSG confirm Kylian Mbappe's return to training after 'positive' talks over future,"Aug 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-confirm-kylian-mbappe-return-training-positive-talks-future,"90min reported earlier this week that Mbappe had reiterated his desire to stay at PSG beyond this summer despite not taking up his option to trigger a clause which would extend his current contract at the club until the summer of 2025. That decision not to trigger an extension had led to PSG shopping the superstar forward around this summer due to the fear of losing him as a free agent next summer. The Ligue 1 giants accepted a world record offerÂ of Â£257m (â¬300m) from Al Hilal last month, but despite proposing a gargantuan contract offer to Mbappe, the PIF-backed Saudi Pro League side wereÂ unable to persuade the France star to enter negotiations. On top of trying to sell Mbappe, PSG had also banished the player from first-team training and even refused to select him for their recent pre-season tour of Japan.  manual Now, however, the 2018 World Cup winner is back in the first-team squad and back in training with his teammates after what the club have described as positive talks regarding the player's future which took place on Saturday.  A club statement on the news reads: ""After very constructive and positive discussions between Paris Saint-Germain and Kylian Mbappe before the PSG - Lorient match, this Saturday 12th August, the player was reinstated in first-team training this morning.""  Mbappe was in the stands on Saturday for PSG's 0-0 draw with Lorient in their Ligue 1 season opener, sitting alongside new teammate Ousmane Dembele, whom the club officially confirmed the signing of on Saturday morning. The pair could feature together for the first time at club level next Saturday when Luis Enrique's team take on Toulouse."

Juventus and Napoli had earlier been interested in taking Gnonto back to Italy. Leeds are determined to keep Gnonto him as they hope to make a swift return to the Premier League, communicating to both the player and his representatives that he will not be available for a transfer.  Manager Daniel Farke confirmed Gnonto's unavailability and ahead of the Birmingham fixture, the club chose to issue a formal statement on the matter. feed ""Earlier this week, Willy Gnonto and his representatives were informed by the club that he would not be sold this summer,"" it read. ""Following those conversations, Willy felt he was unable to play in Wednesday nightâs Carabao Cup tie with Shrewsbury Town.

This is now an internal disciplinary matter and the club will make no further comment, other than to reiterate that Willy Gnonto is not for sale."" With Leeds making clear their stance, 90min understands that Everton have switched targets, albeit not very far. Instead, the Toffees are now keen on Gnonto's teammate Jack Harrison. Talks regarding a potential loan move to Goodison Park are underway."
Fenerbahce announce signing of Fred from Man Utd,"Aug 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/fenerbahce-announce-signing-of-fred-from-man-utd,"The Brazil international completed his medical on Saturday in Istanbul after Fenerbahce agreed to pay Â£13m (â¬15m) inclusive of add-ons for his services.

Saudi Pro League determined to be a place for 'exceptional players only',"Aug 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/saudi-pro-league-determined-exceptional-players-only,"The former technical director of Chelsea assumed his role in July and is continuing the Pro League's significant Â£400m investment initiative. This strategy has enticed players such as Karim Benzema, Jordan Henderson, Riyad Mahrez, and Roberto Firmino to join Saudi Arabian clubs this summer. So far, the majority of top stars heading to Saudi Arabia, including Benzema, N'Golo Kante and Cristiano Ronaldo, have been in the latter stages of their respective careers. At 26, Ruben Neves is one of the exceptions to the trend and arguably not in the same bracket of star anyway. Richard Masters, chief executive of the Premier League, recently shared that he isn't overly worried about Saudi Arabia's unrestricted spending. However, Emenalo cautioned that there are essentially no bounds to the country's willingness to invest in football players.  ""I would loveÂ to have Kylian Mbappe here. I would love to have Harry Kane here. The league would like all the top players,"" he said. Indeed, Mbappe has already been the subject of world record Â£259m bid from Al Hilal that was accepted by Paris Saint-Germain, although the plater himself wasn't interested in the move. manual ""In a couple of years, this will become a league for exceptional players only. It will become a league for those who are at the top of their game. We have the resources, and weâre going to use them,"" Emenalo said. ""I donât think it is going to take the same amount of time that it took the [English] Premier League to get there for us to establish ourselves."" Emenalo emphasised that the Saudi Pro League's aim is not to undermine the Premier League in a manner similar to LIV Golf and the PGA Tour and hopes that elite football's established order in Europe will eventually be less apprehensive and collaborate with them. âThe European leagues, especially the Premier League, are very strong, they have no reason to be scared,â he added. âI think thereâs panic in some areas, but this is from a misunderstanding of what we are trying to do. âI saw what [Jurgen] Klopp and what [Pep] Guardiola said [about the Pro League]. One is a coach I absolutely admire and the other is a good friend of mine in Pep. First, I hope they donât talk themselves out of a job [in Saudi Arabia] in the future. I understand their concerns. Our goal is to work together with all the leagues and be a brotherhood in the football industry.â"
Real Sociedad threaten to walk away from stalling Donny van de Beek talks,"Aug 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/real-sociedad-threaten-walk-away-stalling-donny-van-de-beek-talks,"Van de Beek was a Ballon dâOr nominee in 2019 thanks to his starring role for Erik ten Hagâs Ajax team on their journey to getting within seconds of the Champions League final. But a cruel combination of difficulty adapting to more physical English football, injuries, poor form and a lack of confidence has seen the Dutchman struggle to make an impact at Old Trafford, even after being reunited with former boss and mentor Ten Hag last season. As 90min has reported, Van de Beek has been exploring his options to leave throughout the summer, with his agents in contact with a number of European clubs. That follow decisions from Ten Hag, who retains a healthy relationship, and the club to give him permission to move on. In addition to AC Milan, Inter and Roma, there was Premier League interest from Wolves, Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace, plus from Celtic north of the Scottish border. feed An offer from Real Sociedad came in early August, with the Spanish club proposing a loan with option to buy ahead of their return to the Champions League this season. However, a problem has arisen. 90min understands that the two clubs have so far been unable to come to an agreement over the exact make up of the deal. Van de Beek himself remains particularly keen and so there is still an underlying expectation that it will happen, but there is now a threat of Real Sociedad potentially walking away altogether. United have already successfully offloaded Fred to Fenerbahce, raising Â£13m in the process, and departures from the midfield are important to free up space on the wage bill as the club continues to target Fiorentina and Morocco star Sofyan Amrabat. Overall, spending at Old Trafford so far this summer on Mason Mount, Andre Onana and Rasmus Hojlund is already close to Â£180m once add-ons are taken into account."
Man Utd negotiating Benjamin Pavard transfer fee with Bayern Munich,"Aug 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-negotiating-benjamin-pavard-transfer-fee-bayern-munich,"The versatile Pavard, capable of playing as a centre-back or right-back, joined Bayern in 2019 and has entered the final year of his contract at the Allianz Arena. With Maguire in the process of leaving Old Trafford before next monthâs transfer deadline, Pavard had been among a number of options to replace the former captain. As 90min revealed last week, United are preparing to enter the transfer market once Maguireâs exit is completed. The England international had initially wanted to stay and fight for his place, despite slipping down the pecking order last season and losing the captaincy early in pre-season. feed But the Red Devils agreed a Â£30m fee with fellow Premier League side West Ham United. Talks have continued to hammer out the details of the proposed deal, although things have progressed slower than had been hoped. That being said, all parties expect a conclusion to still be reached soon. Pavard has been offered to United, with Niceâs Jean-Clair Todibo, ex-Ajax defender Perr Schuurs, Jarrad Branthwaite of Everton, one-time Tottenham target Edmond Tapsoba and Benficaâs Antonio Silva all considered by the club to replace Maguire. But it is the Pavard path on which United are now progressing and 90min understands that negotiations with Bayern over the transfer fee are taking place. The perennial German champions value the Frenchman at Â£30m (â¬35m), which is higher than the Â£25.9m (â¬30m) that United have so far proposed. That figure hasnât yet convinced Bayern to sell, but the difference in valuation has not dissuaded the sides from continuing to talk."

Chelsea confident of beating Liverpool to record Moises Caicedo transfer,"Aug 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-confident-beating-liverpool-record-moises-caicedo-transfer,"Liverpool had agreed a deal with Brighton to sign Caicedo on Thursday evening worth Â£111m and the 21-year-old was due on Merseyside for a medical on Friday morning. However, it quickly became apparent that Caicedo was not going to travel to the north of England as he and his agents made it clear to Brighton that he would still prefer a move to Chelsea. The Blue had previously seen a number of bids rejected, the biggest of which had been worth Â£80m and was still someway short of the minimum Â£100m asking price required by the Seagulls. Now, whilst an agreement is not yet finalised, 90min has been informed that talks are progressing between Chelsea and Brighton and the deal is set to be worth in excess of the Â£111m fee agreed with Liverpool earlier in the week. Once confirmed, it would break Chelsea's own British record which they set in January when signing Enzo Fernandez from Benfica in a deal worth Â£106m 90min can also confirm that talks between Caicedo have accelerated to the point that personal terms are all finalised and the Ecuadorian is ready to put pen to paper on an eight-year contract as soon as the two clubs confirm an agreement over price is in place. feed Chelsea are hopeful that they could parade both Caicedo and Romeo Lavia, who is close to finalising move from Southampton after a Â£55m fee was agreed, ahead of Sunday's Premier League clash with, ironically, Liverpool, who not only wanted Caicedo but also had multiple bids for Lavia rejected.

Why would Real Madrid want to sign Kepa Arrizabalaga?,"Aug 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/why-would-real-madrid-want-to-sign-kepa-arrizabalaga,"The Belgian colossus has been pivotal to Madrid's success in recent years and Carlo Ancelotti hasn't had to think twice about who to start between the sticks. Courtois has been one of the world's leading shot-stoppers and his absence will be sorely felt by the Spanish side next season. Ancelotti needs a replacement for his number one, and has looked towards his old club Chelsea for a solution. Madrid have expressed their interest in taking Blues goalkeeper Kepa on loan for next season, a deal which Chelsea may be willing to sanction given their recent acquisition of Robert Sanchez. Here's why Real Madrid want Kepa at the Bernabeu. Considering Real Madrid will be relying on Andriy Lunin in their season opener against Athletic Club, Kepa's experience and quality would be a welcome addition to Los Blancos' squad. The Spanish stopper managed 39 appearances after reclaiming his starting spot from Edouard Mendy at Chelsea last year, including two encounters with Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals. Kepa performed admirably given the criticism he has received in previous seasons, establishing himself as the club's guaranteed number one. Kepa ranked in the top 24% of Premier League goalkeepers for saves (3.16), save percentage (73.3%) and goals against (1.16) per 90 last campaign. He also boasted a +0.18 rate when it came to post-shot expected goals  minus goals conceded, suggesting that Kepa was performing significantly above average in terms of his shot-stopping. His ability and competence outside of his own penalty area could also be crucial for Madrid. He ranked in the top 17% of Premier League goalkeepers for number of defensive actions per 90 outside of his box (1.82), showcasing his quality in sweeping up opposition balls over the top. While not as significant in an Ancelotti team, it will still allow Madrid to press higher up the pitch, knowing Kepa can sniff out danger when direct balls are played in behind the defence.  Overall, Kepa provides Madrid with a cost-effective and experienced option. Add this to the fact that he is Spanish and knows La Liga intimately, and it seems like something of a no-brainer for Madrid, especially if they are only exploring a loan deal. Club Appearances Saves Save percentage Clean sheets Chelsea 162 379 69.4% 57 Athletic Club 54 134 67.7% 15 Real Valladolid 40 161 77.8% 12 Ponferradina 19 51 72.9% 8 *All stats courtesy of FBref feed Despite having initially prioritised a move for Sevilla goalkeeper Yassine Bounou, the asking price for the Moroccan appears to be a stumbling block stopping the deal from progressing. Attention has therefore turned to Kepa, who has also interested Bayern Munich, but Real Madrid don't want to rush into making a signing given the multitude of options potentially available to them. Kepa, however, is under serious consideration, with Courtois set for a long spell on the sidelines. At present, Madrid are said to only be interested in loaning the 28-year-old from Chelsea, although such a deal could have an option to buy or mandatory buy clause inserted into it. Given Chelsea's expensive pursuit of Moises Caicedo and Romeo Lavia, a permanent deal that could recoup some transfer funds may be preferential."
Jurgen Klopp confirms Liverpool exit stance for Saudi linked star,"Aug 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jurgen-klopp-confirms-liverpool-exit-saudi-star,"Thiago is the latest Liverpool midfielder to attract interest from Saudi Arabia, with reports suggesting a reunion with Roberto Firmino at Al Ahli could be on the cards. Liverpool have already sold both Jordan Henderson and Fabinho to Saudi Arabia, while James Milner, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Naby Keita have departed on free transfers, leaving Klopp's side a little light in midfield. As a result, there are no plans to offload Thiago, who is back in training after recovery from a hip injury. ""Heâs now training, he came in and asked about his role and we spoke,"" Klopp told his pre-match press conference before Liverpool's opening Premier League game of the new season. ""[Heâs a] super experienced player, he stepped up in that department. He has only been in team training for a week but very vocal, he is going to be very helpful for us."" feed Liverpool continue to search for midfield reinforcements and have been in talks over both Brighton's Moises Caicedo and Southampton's Romeo Lavia. A British record deal of Â£111m was agreed for the former but interest from Chelsea has proven to be a real problem. The Blues had been chasing Caicedo all summer and the Ecuador international is understood to be prioritising a move to Stamford Bridge as a result. Meanwhile, Chelsea are also closing in on a deal for Lavia, for whom Liverpool had three bids rejected before igniting their pursuit of Caicedo. Liverpool's third offer for Lavia stood at Â£46m - short of Southampton's Â£50m asking price - but Chelsea are pursuing an agreement which would be worth Â£55m. Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai have already arrived at Anfield, adding significant creative ability to Liverpool's ranks."
Kepa Arrizabalaga among Real Madrid options after Yassine Bounou talks stall,"Aug 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/kepa-arrizabalaga-real-madrid-yassine-bounou-talks-stall,"Madrid lost usual starter Thibaut Courtois to an ACL injury earlier this week, with the Belgian stopper set to spend the majority of the coming campaign on the sidelines as a result.

Club officials have drawn up a long list of potential targets, including former Manchester United star David de Gea, but further contact has been made with Kepa as Madrid seek to explore all their options. Kepa has been targeted by Bayern Munich this week as the German side seek to replace their own injured goalkeeper, Manuel Neuer, but Madrid are now exploring a rival bid for the Chelsea man. feed Chelsea have already been active in the goalkeeper market this summer, selling Edouard Mendy to Al Ahli and replacing him with Robert Sanchez of Brighton, but the interest in Kepa has seen them reignite their search for a new stopper. Long-term target Giorgi Mamardashvili of Valencia remains on Chelsea's wish list, while the Blues are also known to have considered their own move for De Gea, who is available as a free agent following his departure from United. Porto's Diogo Costa has plenty of admirers at Stamford Bridge but is understood to be too expensive for the Blues, who are locked in talks over a double deal for Brighton's Moises Caicedo and Southampton's Romeo Lavia that could cost in excess of Â£160m. Madrid are relaxed about their quest for a new stopper, believing there are plenty of options available to them. Leeds United's Illan Meslier has also been added to the shortlist as the Spanish side continue their search. Publicly, manager Carlo Ancelotti has put his faith in usual deputy Andriy Lunin, who is expected to start in goal for Madrid against Athletic Club on Saturday, but a move for a new goalkeeper is expected to be made soon enough."

Bayern Munich complete signing of Harry Kane from Tottenham,"Aug 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/breaking-bayern-munich-complete-signing-harry-kane-tottenham,"The 30-year-old has signed a four-year contract with the Bundesliga giants, bringing the curtain down on a glittering Spurs career that saw him usurp Jimmy Greaves as the club's all-time record goalscorer. Kane has been Bayern's primary target this summer, as the Bavarians look to finally replace the guaranteed goals of Robert Lewandowski, and have finally got a deal over the line after months of negotiating with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy. 90min understands that Bayern will pay â¬100m (Â£86.4m) to Tottenham for Kane, but the deal could be worth more should potential add-ons be triggered. ""Bayern is one of the biggest clubs in the world, and Iâve always said that I want to compete and prove myself at the highest level during my career,"" Kane told Bayern's media team after confirmation of the move. ""This club is defined by its winning mentality."" Kane leaves the Premier League widely regarded as one of the greatest strikers of the modern era. A Spurs academy graduate quickly dubbed 'one of our own', he broke into the first team towards the back end of the 2013/14 season, before scoring 21 Premier League goals and 31 in all competitions the following year. manual The club's famous number 10 shirt was soon his, and Kane continued to deliver the goods for Tottenham in addition to becoming one of England's best players. He won multiple Premier League Player of the Month awards (seven in total) and was named in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year five times. Kane also bagged the Premier League Golden Boot three times, though his career-best 30 goals during the 2017/18 season was not enough to earn him the gong ahead of Mohamed Salah. That goal haul was matched last season despite Tottenham's struggles in the Premier League, and it was apparent that Kane, who came close to leaving the club a couple of years ago to join Manchester City, may need to leave in order to fulfil his trophy ambitions. With just a year left on his contract, Real Madrid and Manchester United were expected to pounce, but it's Bayern Munich who have got a deal over the line after months of courting. Kane is believed to have been registered in time to play in Saturday's night German Super Cup final against RB Leipzig - a game that could see Kane lift the first silverware of his club career less than 24 hours after arriving in Germany."
Chelsea closing in on Â£55m agreement to sign Romeo Lavia,"Aug 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-closing-in-55m-agreement-to-sign-romeo-lavia,"The Blues have a long-standing interest in the midfielder having tried to sign him last summer just weeks after he first joined the Saints from Manchester City.

Liverpool have seen three bids for Lavia rejected by Southampton this summer as they did not meet their Â£50m valuation, and the Merseysiders could now be beaten to his signature by Chelsea. feed 90min understands that a deal to take Lavia from St Mary's to Stamford Bridge worth Â£55m is close to being agreed, roughly 24 hours after Chelsea reignited their interest in the 19-year-old. Lavia has not made a competitive appearance for Southampton this season due to intense speculation regarding a move away. Chelsea and Liverpool's transfer business in recent days has been intertwined. The Reds appeared to have beaten the Blues to Brighton's Moises Caicedo after launching a British-record Â£111m bid on Friday morning, but the Ecuadorian is holding out for a move to west London instead. Though they intend to match Liverpool's mammoth offer in the coming hours, Brighton are yet to receive a new bid from Chelsea.

Carlo Ancelotti explains how Real Madrid will cope without Thibaut Courtois,"Aug 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/carlo-ancelotti-how-real-madrid-will-cope-without-thibaut-courtois,"Courtois is set to undergo surgery after tearing his ACL in training and is subsequently expected to miss the vast majority of the upcoming campaign, leaving Madrid with Lunin as their only senior goalkeeper. As 90min reported following Courtois' injury, Madrid have not yet ruled out keeping Lunin as their starting goalkeeper, although club officials are drawing up a list of potential targets as they seek to bolster in the position once again. After contact was made with free agent David de Gea, Madrid focused their efforts on Sevilla stopper Yassine Bounou, who is keen to make the move this summer. However, with Lunin set to start the campaign in goal as Madrid open their season against Athletic Club on Saturday, Ancelotti reiterated his faith in the 24-year-old. feed ""Emotionally, it was not a good day,"" Ancelotti told a press conference. ""We are sad on a personal level as it is an injury to an important player, but these things happen in football. ""We wish [Courtois] a speedy recovery and we give all the confidence in the world to Lunin, who is a great goalkeeper. In pre-season, he did well. Total confidence in him, we think he is a talent. What he lacks is what everyone lacks, experience, but he will take it game by game."" Asked whether he would like a new signing, Ancelotti responded: ""We have time until 31 August. Behind Lunin, our goalkeepers have potential, but they are young. We will think about it. Fran [Gonzalez] is 17 years old. ""If we sign a new goalkeeper, we will do it for numbers because we have confidence in Lunin. The confidence in Lunin is total."" Ancelotti ended with a simple assessment of the sort of goalkeeper he would like to see Madrid bring in. âOne that stops the ball with his hands,"" the Italian quipped. ""First and foremost, one that makes saves. That is what I ask of all goalkeepers. Let them be good with their hands. When it comes to feet, it's better to have a striker."""

Caicedo was due on Merseyside to undergo a medical soon after the conclusion of Klopp's presser, but has yet to arrive to complete the move to Liverpool and the club are believed to be furious at his representatives. 90min now understands that the Ecuador international has informed Brighton that he is prioritising a move to Chelsea and wants the club to allow further time to receive an acceptable offer. feed Chelsea saw bids worth Â£70m and Â£80m for Caicedo rejected by Brighton earlier this summer, despite being made aware that only offers north of Â£100m would be considered, and sources have told 90min they will now match Liverpool's record sum in the next 24 hours in order to try and close a deal. 90min reported earlier on Friday that Chelsea were refusing to accept defeat in the race to sign Caicedo and it appears they may be given another chance to make their move for their top midfield target.

Bayern Munich's Benjamin Pavard has been offered to the Red Devils and has made it clear in recent months that he wants to continue his playing career at centre-back as opposed to right-back. Nice's Jean-Clair Todibo, Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite, Torino's Perr Schuurs and Bayer Leverkusen's Edmond Tapsoba are all on Man Utd's shortlist. Maguire was stripped of the club captaincy this summer and removed entirely from Man Utd's leadership group, with Bruno Fernandes being promoted to skipper.

He is expected to become their starting striker once he returns to full fitness following a back injury, United have had a long-standing interest in Harry Kane, but they did not make any advances to Tottenham Hotspur this summer, and the 30-year-old is now set to join Bayern Munich after the two clubs agreed on an Â£86.4m fee. Ahead of Monday's Premier League opener at home to Wolves, Ten Hag was asked about Kane's move to the Bundesliga and Man Utd's own interest - with the Dutchman admitting his exit is a blow to England's top flight. ""I don't think that I have to go into that discussion or give an opinion about that,"" Ten Hag said. ""We are professional, the processes we do are really careful. ""We consider a lot of things but finally we make decisions, we don't take decisions overnight, there is a strategy in every decision behind and we are happy with the squad we have behind us now. feed ""We have chosen a striker and we are really happy with our choice.

United ironically travel to Tottenham next Saturday for their second Premier League fixture of the season, and could instead up against a forward line led by Son Heung-min and Richarlison, who spent most of last season on the bench despite costing the north Londoners Â£60m when joining from Everton. Hojlund won't be available for the Red Devils, as he nurses his back injury, and that could put the onus on Marcus Rashford to again score the goals for Ten Hag's side.

Kane will fly to Germany on Friday to finalise the transfer. Spurs boss Postecoglou insisted last week that he simply wanted the saga resolved as soon as possible to plan for the season ahead. Ahead of Sunday's trip to Brentford for his Premier League debut, Postecoglou was understandably asked for an update on Kane. ""It's fair to say I don't have a blow by blow account of the whole thing but fair to say it's progressed to the point where it looks like it's going to happen. We move forward without Harry. It gives us clarity and unless something unforeseen happens we'll move on,"" he said. ""I didn't see the point in [pitching myself] because whatever I was going to say was going to be irrelevant. I could plan his grand vision but I'm sure he'd heard it all before. My feeling was we'll get to know each other, that's the best way to navigate this early bit. Having said that, in my mind after that initial conversation [on the first day], he'd made up his mind that if the clubs agreed he'd go but he was also happy to stay if they didn't. ""It's best Harry speaks for himself on the decision but there's no doubts he's one of the greats of this football club. His record speaks for himself. I'm only new in the building but I'm certainly not the spokesman for this football club in declaring people's status but I think it's clear Harry Kane is one of the greats. ""I think if you're involved in football as long as I have, you know clubs are not going to talk to each other without the player knowing. We weren't talking to Wolfsburg without knowing Micky van de Ven wanted to come. ""[Harry and I] had a chat on the first day. He was up front and honest that if they could agree a deal then he would go. He wanted it decided by the first game and that was my preference as well."" manual When asked how Tottenham will go about replacing Kane, Postecoglou added: ""I don't think there's a like for like replacement for Harry. We've been planning for this for a while to be fair. It doesn't take too much investigative work to know that this was going to happen. Our business up to now reflects that. ""I don't think it works that way [giving Daniel Levy a list of strikers to get]. It's not like the family shopping list to go and get milk and bread for the kids. My whole strategy has been that Harry was unlikely to be around so it wasn't like we had a pow wow this morning."" 90min revealed earlier this week that Spurs representatives had touched base with other forwards, including Gent starlet Gift Orban."
Chelsea refusing to give up on Moises Caicedo despite Liverpool agreement,"Aug 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-refusing-give-up-moises-caicedo-liverpool-agreement,"The Blues failed with an Â£80m offer and were considering returning with a bid closer to Brighton's Â£100m asking price when Liverpool swooped in and agreed a British record deal worth Â£111m to sign the 21-year-old. Nothing has been signed between Brighton and Liverpool, however, and sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea are refusing to accept defeat in the race. Chelsea have informed Caicedo's representatives that they are prepared to battle to try and sign the midfielder and will not give up hope until he has put pen to paper on a deal with Liverpool. As it stands, Chelsea have not made a new bid for Caicedo, with Liverpool the only side to have seen an offer accepted. Before Liverpool's offer arrived, 90min understood that Caicedo's preference was to join Chelsea this summer, with the midfielder repeatedly making it clear to Brighton that he wanted to be allowed to speak to the Blues. feed Caicedo has not yet travelled to Merseyside for a scheduled medical, 90min further understands, and Chelsea are using the time to try and work on a solution. Brighton are hoping to sell Caicedo to the highest bidder and wasted little time in accepting Liverpool's offer, which was significantly higher than any proposal put forward until now by Chelsea. The two clubs, who ironically meet in their opening Premier League fixture on Sunday, have also butted heads  over Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia. The Reds failed with three bids for the Belgian, the last of which was worth Â£46m, before Chelsea arrived with an offer of Â£48m. Southampton value Lavia at Â£50m and are not prepared to compromise on their price. Where Caicedo ends up remains to be seen, but the twists and turns of the transfer have made it one of the most fascinating sagas of what's been an extraordinary window to date."
Real Madrid turn attention to Sevilla goalkeeper after Thibaut Courtois injury,"Aug 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/real-madrid-sevilla-goalkeeper-thibaut-courtois-injury,"The Belgian suffered an ACL injury during a training session earlier this week and will soon undergo surgery, which will keep him on the sidelines for the vast majority of the 2023/24 La Liga season. With Ukraine international Andriy Lunin the only other goalkeeper in Carlo Ancelotti's squad, Madrid are prepared to enter the transfer market for a new stopper and have identified a number of potential targets. Contact has been made with former Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea, while Chelsea's Kepa Arrizabalaga is also seen as a candidate for a loan move, but sources have confirmed to 90min that Bounou is at the top of Madrid's wish list. 32-year-old Bounou, who excelled with Morocco at the World Cup, has made 157 appearances in La Liga across his career, emerging as one of the division's most-reliable stoppers since his switch to Sevilla in 2020. feed 90min understands that Bounou has made it clear he would like the chance to move to Madrid and Sevilla are prepared to do business for a fee of around â¬20m (Â£17.3m). Madrid were not planning to do any additional business after an expensive shopping spree which brought Jude Bellingham, Arda Guler, Fran Garcia and Joselu to the club, but Courtois' serious injury has forced them back into the market. While club officials are understood to be fans of Lunin, there is a desire to bring in a goalkeeper with more La Liga experience as Ancelotti seeks to wrestle the league title back from rivals Barcelona. Defence was a real issue for Ancelotti during pre-season, with the Spanish side conceding eight goals across four games, and the injury to Courtois has only complicated his attempted solution."

Indeed, in 2016, Klopp was left stunned by Manchester United's Â£89m acquisition of Paul Pogba - a world record at the time - and vowed he would never pull the trigger on such a deal. ""The day that this is football, I'm not in a job anymore, because the game is about playing together,"" Klopp said at the time. ""Other clubs can go out and spend more money and collect top players. I want to do it differently. I would even do it differently if I could spend that money."" feed Having now agreed to sign Caicedo for Â£111m in the same summer as Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister moved to Liverpool for a combined Â£95m, Klopp confessed the market has been thrown into turmoil since his comments on Pogba. ""Everything changed,"" he told a press conference on Friday. ""Do I like it? No, but did I realise I was wrong? Definitely. Definitely. That's the way it goes. It's not great, it's not top. Saudi Arabia will not help with that. I'm not blaming it, but another market with a lot of money. ""In the end, we as a club, we have to try make sure that we, with our resources, get the best possible team together. We try everything to bring together the best squad for us, and we are not in dreamland, so it's not like we can just point at players and bring them in. ""If people want to throw my quotes from five or six years ago at me, no problem. That's what I thought that day, and I realise now I was wrong, easy to admit that."""

""I can confirm that the deal with the club is agreed,"" Klopp told a press conference when asked about the Caicedo bid. ""What did change? We are a club, we have not endless resources, we didn't expect a couple of things happening in the summer - Hendo, Fab, stuff like this.

Caicedo had been Chelsea's prime midfield target all summer, but they baulked at the idea of meeting Brighton's value - which has always been at least Â£100m - while Liverpool's offer of Â£111m was immediately accepted. Such a deal would represent a British record, eclipsing the Â£106m Chelsea paid to land Enzo Fernandez in January. Chelsea made numerous offers for Caicedo, but their highest did not exceed Â£80m and now they have missed out on the Ecuador star who is destined for Anfield, where he will help form an overhauled midfield containing Hungarian star Dominik Szoboszlai and former Seagulls teammate Alexis Mac Allister. feed Caicedo is now due to head to Merseyside to complete his medical and is expected to sign his contract before this weekend's Premier League opener, which just so happens to come against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. For Liverpool, the deal is an obvious club record, eclipsing the Â£75m paid to sign centre-back Virgil van Dijk from Southampton in January 2018. While such an expensive move was not initially on the cards this summer, Liverpool raised significant funds through the unplanned sales of Jordan Henderson and Fabinho to Saudi Arabia and ultimately decided to pull the trigger. As for Chelsea, the Blues joined the bidding for Liverpool target Lavia earlier this week as they submitted a Â£48m offer for the Southampton midfielder, who has been valued at Â£50m.

Harry Kane agrees to leave Tottenham for Bayern Munich,"Aug 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/harry-kane-agrees-leave-tottenham-bayern-munich,"Bayern lodged four bids for the England striker, eventually agreeing to a â¬100m (Â£86.4m) deal to lure Kane away, but the striker himself did not immediately give his approval to a move as he considered all his options. While the initial delay left Spurs feeling hopeful they may have convinced their captain to stay, 90min understands that Kane has now accepted Bayern's proposal and is set to leave the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this summer. Kane, who set a deadline of Sunday to resolve his future, is due in Germany on Friday to undergo a medical ahead of signing a four-year contract with the Bundesliga champions. However, Spurs have currently delayed signing off on the deal and are keen to finalise each and every minor detail before allowing Kane to depart. Bayern are hopeful that Kane will be in attendance for Saturday's Super Cup clash with RB Leipzig, perhaps even playing a role in the match if all goes to plan. feed The move to Germany, if sealed as expected, will bring an end to Kane's 19-year association with Tottenham, in which he has racked up 280 goals in 435 appearances. Kane's pursuit of Alan Shearer's all-time Premier League top scorer record will also be halted, perhaps permanently. The 30-year-old has struck 213 times in the competition, 47 fewer than Blackburn and Newcastle icon Shearer. While they had been hopeful of keeping Kane, Spurs have been exploring potential replacements for the England captain in anticipation of a departure. Argentina youth international Alejo Veliz has agreed to join but Spurs are also looking at the likes of Gent's Gift Orban, Montpellier's Elye Wahi and Lille's Jonathan David. Aleksandar Mitrovic of Fulham is also on Spurs' radar.

Man Utd goalkeeper undergoing Bayer Leverkusen medical,"Aug 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-goalkeeper-undergoing-bayer-leverkusen-medical,"Now 23, Kovar has been with United since the age of 17. He joined from home-town club Solvacko in 2018 and has been loaned out to Swindon Town, Burton Albion and Sparta Prague during that time. It was his loan at Sparta last season that brought Kovar to wider attention. It was his very first year as a top flight starter and he helped the club win the Czech First League and return to the Champions League qualifying rounds. 90min reported in May that Kovarâs form on loan had caught the eye of his parent club. There were glowing reviews coming back from Prague and he was included in the thought process regarding the goalkeeping position long before Andre Onana was eventually signed. At a time when David de Gea was widely expected to sign a new contract at Old Trafford, United staff considered the possibility that Kovar could emerge as the Spaniardâs chief back-up and limit the need to spend big on a new goalkeeper. feed However, De Geaâs contract offer was later withdrawn and revised, ultimately leading to him leaving the club as a free agent. It accelerated the need for a readymade number one and so the club spent handsomely to sign Onana from Inter, reuniting the Cameroonian with Erik ten Hag. Kovar was briefly involved in Unitedâs pre-season programme, playing 135 minutes of the opening two summer friendlies against Leeds and Lyon. But his immediate future now lies elsewhere. 90min understands that a Â£7.8m (â¬9m) transfer fee has been agreed with Bayer Leverkusen and that a medical to complete the transfer is already being undertaken. Ties with Kovar have not been fully cut though, as United have retained a buy-back clause that could see him return to Manchester. Leverkusen finished sixth in the Bundesliga last season following a remarkable turnaround once Xabi Alonso was appointed head coach, having been flirting with relegation initially. It means that Kovar could have the chance to play Europa League football in 2023/24. He will compete with veteran Finland international and current Leverkusen captain Lukas Hradecky. United have extensively recruited emerging Czech goalkeepers in recent years. Kovar himself succeeded Alex Fojticek as youth team number one, while Radek Vitek was included in the first-team squad for this summerâs pre-season tour of America. Ondrej Mastny is also still on the books, having spent the first half of 2023 on loan at Northern Irish club Portadown."
Man Utd agree Fred transfer fee with Turkish giants,"Aug 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-agree-fred-transfer-fee-turkish-giants,"Fred made 56 appearances for United last season, although he was primarily a back-up option and started only 12 times in the Premier League. The Brazilian has since also seen Mason Mount join the club, adding further competition for midfield places. It was the arrivals of both Christian Eriksen and Casemiro last summer that initially pushed him down the Old Trafford pecking order. Fulham had been interested in Fred, who joined United ahead of Manchester City from Shakhtar Donetsk for close to Â£50m in the summer of 2018, but were not prepared to meet the asking price. feed Nottingham Forest were also in touch with the playerâs representatives, but didnât take things further, while Roma made an enquiry too. As 90min reported at the time, Galatasaray had an offer rejected in mid-July because it fell short of the Â£20m asking price. Now, however, United have agreed to sell for less. The deal negotiated with Fenerbahce is worth Â£13m (â¬15m), inclusive of add-ons. Fred also resisted the opportunity to move to the Saudi Pro League, which has already welcomed the likes of NâGolo Kante, Fabinho, Jordan Henderson and Ruben Neves from the Premier League this summer. Fred's departure from Old Trafford is likely to see the number 17 shirt handed to new signing Rasmus Hojlund. The Danish striker is currently nursing a pre-season injury that will delay his debut for the club and hasn't yet been assigned a squad number. He previously wore 17 at Atalanta."
Jean-Clair Todibo: Nice manager responds to Man Utd transfer interest,"Aug 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jean-clair-todibo-nice-manager-responds-man-utd-transfer-interest,"United are on the cusp of selling Harry Maguire to West Ham United for Â£30m and have identified former Barcelona defender Todibo as a potential replacement for the Englishman. One of the top performers in Ligue 1 last season, Todibo is rated incredibly highly by everyone at Nice, including new manager Farioli, but while the boss wants to keep Todibo, he admitted he could not guarantee no business would be done. ""I also have two vice-captains Khephren Thuram and Jean-Clair Todibo who are among the best players in the team,"" Farioli told the media. ""We would like both players to stay until the end of the season, but you cannot escape the reality of the transfer window. We'll see what happens. As long as they're here, I'm enjoying having them."" feed He continued: ""Of course we would like Todibo to stay, but it can be complicated. We have to wait to see who will want to buy him and if everyone finds an agreement there.  ""He is a leader, a very strong player mentally, he has improved a lot and he is ready to reach the very top level."" United have drawn up a sizeable list of potential replacements for Maguire. Alongside Todibo, there is also interest in Torino's Perr Schuurs and Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite, while Bayer Leverkusen's Edmond Tapsoba is seen as an expensive alternative. The Red Devils have also been offered the chance to sign versatile Bayern Munich defender Benjamin Pavard, who is in the final year of his contract and is expected to be available for a fee similar to the Â£30m United are in line to receive for Maguire."
Tottenham hopeful of Harry Kane stay despite Bayern Munich agreement,"Aug 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-hopeful-harry-kane-stay-bayern-munich-agreement,"Having seen Kane enter the final year of his contract, Spurs have begrudgingly accepted a bid from Bayern worth â¬100m (Â£86.4m) but have long been determined to convince the England international to reject their advances and stay. While Bayern were confident an agreement with Spurs was all that was missing in their pursuit of Kane, sources have confirmed to 90min that the 30-year-old has not yet given his approval to a move to Munich. Kane is understood to be considering his options, one of which is to remain with Spurs beyond this summer, and sources close to the club are now hopeful that Kane will agree to remain at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for at least one more season. The striker informed both Spurs and Bayern earlier this week that he wanted his future resolved by the time the new Premier League season kicks off this weekend, with Spurs due to play Brentford on Sunday. feed Bayern themselves wanted a deal wrapped up when they lodged a third bid which was also worth â¬100m, but based around a less-favourable payment structure for the Premier League side. But they did not get the immediate response they were hoping for as Spurs chairman Daniel Levy delayed his eventual rejection. They have now seen a bid accepted which would satisfy Kane's deadline but the striker has not yet given the green light - a hesitance which has left Spurs optimistic about their chances of keeping the striker. Should Kane stay, he would be able to discuss a free transfer overseas in January, with Spurs at risk of losing him for free next summer, when Premier League rivals would also be able to offer a contract. Spurs have long been determined to keep Kane and have never given up on convincing the England captain to sign a new contract further down the line."
Man Utd target explains why he rejected Old Trafford transfer this summer,"Aug 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-target-explains-why-rejected-old-trafford-transfer,"After David de Gea's departure on a free transfer, United began looking for two new goalkeepers and were reported to have lined up 20-year-old Suzuki, then of Japanese side Urawa Red Diamonds, as a possible backup to new number one Andre Onana. Suzuki had other plans, however, taking his talents to Belgium and joining Sint-Truiden on loan with a view to a permanent transfer next summer. While Suzuki admitted he would love to play for United in future, he confessed that he did not want to sit on the bench behind Â£47.2m signing Onana. feed ""I decided to transfer this time as a step up in aiming to be the best in the world. It's true that there was an offer from Manchester United,"" Suzuki told the media. ""As a football player and as a person, if I hadn't thought about anything, of course, I would like to go to Manchester United, but among them, I really want to spend time thinking about what kind of future awaits me. After much thought, I made this decision. ""Manchester United have acquired Onana. It's important for me to participate in matches, and I think it is also important to play on the world stage. I want to make the most of what I have learned here and do my best."" Despite his initial rejection, Suzuki confirmed he dreams of making the move to the Premier League and flying the flag for his country. ""While many players are active overseas, it is difficult to become a keeper,"" he concluded. ""I think we are going to have a really tough battle ahead of us in that position. ""There are still no Japanese who are active as goalkeepers in the Premier League, so I want to be one of the first players to do so. I want to keep moving forward step by step."""
Kylian Mbappe: PSG forward reinforces stance over summer exit,"Aug 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/kylian-mbappe-psg-stance-summer-exit,"The 24-year-old shocked PSG earlier this summer when he told them he would not be exercising the option to extend his contract, which is set to expire in June next year. PSG have responded by trying to sell Mbappe this summer, in a desperate bid to avoid losing one of the world's best players on a free transfer, but he has made it clear on numerous occasions that he intends to leave next year as a free agent. The Ligue 1 giants even accepted a world record offer of Â£257m (â¬300m) from Al Hilal last month, but despite putting forward a gargantuan contract offer to Mbappe, the PIF-backed Saudi Pro League side were unable to persuade the World Cup Golden Boot winner to enter negotiations. Chelsea have also been contracted by PSG in a bid to drum up further interest in Mbappe, as have a number of other heavyweight European clubs. Mbappe was left out of PSG's recent pre-season tour of Japan and has been banished from first-team duties as the dispute between player and club rages on - sources have told 90min that club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has even warned Fayza Lamari, his mother and agent, that Mbappe will 'not put a PSG shirt on again.' manual Despite the hostile atmopshere, Mbappe's position on the matter remains unchanged. 90min understands that he intends to spend the next 12 months in Paris before moving on to his next venture, which many believe will be at Real Madrid, and he has informed PSG of his plan. Sources close to Mbappe and Real Madrid have vehemently denied that an agreement is already in place for him to move to the Spanish capital next summer, but he came within a whisker of joining Madrid in 2022 before a last-minute change of heart saw him sign a new contract at PSG. Mbappe's sidelining is part of a radical overhaul at PSG this summer. Lionel Messi has already departed for Inter Miami, while the Parisiens are also keen to ship out Neymar. He has interest in his services from Saudi Arabia, with a potential return to Barcelona also rumoured in recent weeks."
West Ham weighing up offer for in-demand Montpellier striker Elye Wahi,"Aug 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-weighing-up-offer-montpellier-elye-wahi,"The Hammers confirmed their first major signing of the summer on Thursday, committing Edson Alvarez to a five-year contract after agreeing to pay Ajax up to Â£34m for his services. Â£30m deals are also in place for Southampton captain James Ward-Prowse and Manchester United defender Harry Maguire, while West Ham also have eyes on signing a new striker, wide forward and left back before the window closes on September 1 â the club have money to spend after selling Declan Rice to Arsenal for a British-record fee of Â£105m. 90min previously revealed that West Ham had shown an interest in 20-year-old Wahi, who bagged 19 goals for Montpellier in Ligue 1, amid concerns that Saudi Pro League side Al Ettifaq, managed by Steven Gerrard, may try to prise Michail Antonio away from London Stadium. That move hasn't come to fruition but Gianluca Scamacca has departed West Ham, joining Atalanta on a permanent basis. His exit has left the club a little light up front, with Antonio, Danny Ings and academy striker Divin Mubama the options at David Moyes' disposal. Sources have now confirmed to 90min that West Ham have made contact with Montpellier over Wahi - a player admired by technical director Tim Steidten - with a view to making an offer for the France Under-21 international. feed But getting a deal over the line won't be easy. Wahi has generated considerable interest this summer, with Arsenal and Chelsea among his Premier League suitors - the latter have been made a verbal offer. Ligue 1 giants Monaco are also considering a bid, though crucially they can't offer European football this season like West Ham can, and Eintracht Frankfurt think Wahi could be the ideal fit to replace Randal Kolo Muani. Kolo Muani has been strongly linked with Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich this summer, as well as Manchester United, and 90min understands that West Ham have enquired about his potential price tag too - PSG are leading the charge though as they cast Kylian Mbappe to one side in a furious dispute over his future, and it looks increasingly likely that Kolo Muani will return to Ligue 1 if a fee can be agreed. Montpellier are expected to demand a fee of at least Â£35m for Wahi, though they still may look to keep him after renewing his contract just six months ago. West Ham's other major piece of business surrounds the interest from Premier League champions Manchester City in Lucas Paqueta. A verbal Â£70m offer was swiftly rejected by the Hammers, who don't want to sell the Brazilian, but it's expected that the treble winners will imminently return with an improved bid."
Chelsea trigger Â£20m release clause in contract of Leeds midfielder,"Aug 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-trigger-20m-release-clause-leeds-midfielder,"The Whites were relegated from the Premier League last season, activating a Â£20m clause that allows Adams to leave Elland Road if a bidding club is prepared to pay in full. 90min revealed on Monday that Chelsea had contacted the representatives of Adams over a move to west London, and personal terms are now being discussed with the 24-year-old United States international. The Blues have also informed Leeds of their intention to pay Adams' release clause in full, and he is expected to undergo a medical within the next 24 hours. Adams is seen as a shrewd signing by those in charge at Stamford Bridge, who are working to provide manager Mauricio Pochettino with the midfield reinforcements he has publicly requested this summer. feed Chelsea are working on a number of midfield signings and recently launched a bid to rival Liverpool for Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia, who has been on the Blues' radar for over 12 months now. After Liverpool saw a Â£46m bid rejected for Lavia, Chelsea put forward an offer of Â£48m, though that remains short of Southampton's Â£50m asking price. Chelsea are also continuing to work on an agreement for Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo, whose Â£100m asking price has so far proven problematic. Liverpool have also made late contact with Brighton over potentially rivalling Chelsea's latest offer, which sat at Â£80m, but have not progressed talks to the point of making a formal offer."

Liverpool make approach to rival Chelsea for Brighton's Moises Caicedo,"Aug 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-make-approach-to-rival-chelsea-brighton-moises-caicedo,"Chelsea have seen multiple bids for Caicedo rejected already this summer, with Brighton holding out for Â£100m. While talks between the two sides remain on, Chelsea have also stepped up their pursuit of potential alternatives. Indeed, a bid was recently lodged for Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia - the subject of three failed offers from Liverpool. With Chelsea threatening to hijack the pursuit of Lavia, sources have confirmed to 90min that Liverpool have made a late move over potentially beating Mauricio Pochettino's side to Caicedo. Sources have stressed that Liverpool have not yet submitted a formal offer for Caicedo but have held talks with Brighton as they explore a possible move to exceed Chelsea's Â£80m proposal. feed 90min understands that Caicedo's preference would be to join Chelsea over Liverpool, but it remains to be seen whether that stance would change if the Reds see an offer accepted. Chelsea sources insist that the Blues remain well in the fight for Caicedo as well as Lavia, with Leeds United's Tyler Adams another target on the table. Liverpool are desperate to continue bolstering their midfield after the surprise departures of Jordan Henderson and Fabinho to Saudi Arabia, and Jurgen Klopp's side have spent a large part of the summer focused on Lavia. Three bids have been knocked back by Southampton, the latest of which was worth around Â£46m, and Chelsea have moved to try and win the race for Lavia with an offer of Â£48m - Â£2m short of the Saints' Â£50m asking price."

Juventus fans storm training pitch to protest potential Romelu Lukaku transfer,"Aug 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/juventus-fans-protest-potential-romelu-lukaku-transfer,"The clubs have spoken this summer about a possible deal for Lukaku which would also see Dusan Vlahovic head to Stamford Bridge, but while Chelsea appreciate the Serbian striker, 90min understands they have a huge issue with Juve's demand for an extra Â£35m as part of the deal. These negotiations came after Lukaku's proposed return to Inter collapsed when the Italian side learned of talks between Juventus and the Belgian, who had privately and publicly vowed never to play for any Serie A side other than Inter. As a result, Lukaku's proposed move to the Allianz Stadium has not gone down well among fans, many of whom were heard screaming ""No, we don't want Lukaku"" during Wednesday's friendly - chants which initially began in the stands during the first minute of the game. It's worth noting that this game between Juventus and Juventus Next Gen took the place of the annual Villar Perosa friendly, in which it is tradition for fans to invade the pitch. But while the event is usually full of positivity as fans get the chance to meet players, a large number of supporters chose to use the opportunity to oppose a move for Lukaku instead. Invasione (anche senza Villar Perosa) #Juve pic.twitter.com/zpGsQcm7Ko Sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea are no longer entertaining the idea of a swap deal between Lukaku and Vlahovic as they do not share Juventus' valuation of the latter, but the Blues are still open to a straight sale if the right bid arrives for Lukaku. Options for Lukaku, who rejected an approach from Saudi Arabia earlier this summer, are proving limited after Inter closed the door on a potential transfer. ""Given what Inter has done for him, we expected him to behave differently, as a professional and as a man,"" Inter vice-president Javier Zanetti told La Gazzetta dello Sport. ""He has the right to go where he wants, of course, but he could have told us that beforehand. Nobody is bigger than the club and when building a team, you always have to consider who you are bringing into the dressing room."""

David Raya's transfer to Arsenal includes initial season-long loan,"Aug 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/david-raya-transfer-arsenal-initial-season-long-loan,"Raya has made it clear that he is ready to take the next step in his career, with Brentford repeatedly pointing suitors to a Â£40m price tag. That figure put Tottenham and Bayern Munich off pursuing a deal, but Arsenal were able to come to a Â£30m agreement earlier this week. It isnât a straight transfer though. 90min understands that the agreement will actually see Raya sign a one-year extension to his Brentford contract so that it then expires in the summer of 2025 instead of at the end of this season â that could have seen him walk away as a free agent. He will then join Arsenal on loan for the duration of the 2023/24 season, rather than outright. At the end of the loan, the Gunners will have an option to make it permanent for the total Â£30m already agreed. It is not, however, an obligation to buy. feed That gives Arsenal a get out option should Raya not succeed in establishing himself. In the same breath, should the Spaniard end up returning to Brentford, his value is protected by the contract extension and they would still have the opportunity to command a sizeable transfer fee. The proposed structure of the deal will financially benefit Arsenal, who have already splashed out more than Â£200m in transfer fees this summer on Kai Havertz, Jurrien Timber and Declan Rice. Hailing from Barcelona, Raya has spent his entire senior career in English football, having moved from Catalan club Cornella to Blackburnâs academy at the age of 16 almost a decade ago. Raya then eventually made more than 100 first-team appearances for the Lancashire club across League One and the Championship, before joining Brentford in 2019. He helped the Bees earn promotion to the Premier League in 2021 and has been a major factor in the club becoming established in the top flight for the first time since relegation in 1947."

Maguire had initially wanted to stay and fight for his place but is now likely to proceed with his Old Trafford departure after talks between the clubs progressed this week. The England international arrived in 2019 for Â£80m, a world record transfer fee for a defender, but has suffered a difficult four years under successive managers Ten Hag, Ralf Rangnick and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He has lost his place entirely in the team under the Dutchman, who has not deemed Maguire suitable to execute the style of football he'd like to implement in Manchester. It had been part of Ten Hag's long-term plan to phase out and replace Maguire, despite his public suggestions otherwise, and now his departure is nearing completion, United are exploring names to replace his position in the squad. They have been offered Benjamin Pavard, a French World Cup winner who has been looking to leave Bayern Munich for the duration of the summer. He would carry the added bonus of being able to cover at right-back should he swap southern Germany for north west England. Bayern are open to letting Pavard leave and he'd likely cost United in the region of what they'd receive for Maguire. feed Nice centre-back Jean-Clair Todibo is a younger alternative at a similar price under consideration, while Liverpool target Perr Schuurs, now of Torino but formerly of Ten Hag's Ajax, is also liked behind the scenes. Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite is another central defender United have been following. Edmond Tapsoba, a Tottenham target who plays for Bayer Leverkusen, represents a more expensive option if United choose to go down that route, though it remains to be seen at present how much they are prepared to outlay and how ambitious they'd like to be with their replacement. Benfica's Antonio Silva is understood to be loved by club scouts but potentially the most expensive of those named. The club are looking to raise funds through the sales of a number of squad players - not just that of Maguire - and are close to moving Fred out of Old Trafford, with several parties interested in the Brazilian. Donny van de Beek is also set to depart for Real Sociedad in the coming weeks, with United pushing for a permanent deal, while Scott McTominay is still of interest to West Ham, who are now threatened by interest from Manchester City in Lucas Paqueta.

The latest scheduling conflict to irk Klopp has been the closing date of the Saudi Pro League's summer transfer window. ""I think pretty much the worst thing is that the transfer window in Saudi Arabia is three weeks longer open,"" Klopp argued ahead of the new Premier League season. ""That's not helpful. So there must be, UEFA, FIFA must find solutions for that."" Klopp knows the power that the Pro League wields better than most after watching two of his starting midfielders Jordan Henderson and Fabinho move to the Middle East this summer. Here's exactly when the Saudi Pro League transfer window closes and how it compares to its European counterparts. Before the window had even officially opened, Saudi clubs had begun to reshape the transfer market with the earth-shattering arrival of Karim Benzema at top-flight champions Al Ittihad. While Cristiano Ronaldo's move to Al Nassr last December was ground-breaking, the acquisition of the reigning Ballon d'Or winner was a statement move. There is still plenty of time for many more. According to the detailed report in the New York Times, Saudi clubs were each provided with numerous transfer recommendations at the start of the window alongside a set of ground rules to prevent inter-league competition for players. During the seismic off-season, Saudi clubs have spent around Â£350m to recruit the likes of Benzema, former Manchester City winger Riyad Mahrez and Sadio Mane from Bayern Munich. No team among Europe's supposed elite has proven capable of matching the financial might from the Middle East. The Saudi Pro League's chief operating officer Carlo Nohra explained to Reuters: ""We had to improve quality and in order to improve quality, you have to bring in the best. Spending was always going to be an essential component for us to do this."" manual When both windows are open, Premier League clubs can at least source replacements for the individuals that chased gold to the Gulf. Yet, there are 19 long days for Saudi sides to pilfer England's helpless top flight. According to FIFA's Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players, transfer windows are determined by each association. World football's governing body stipulates that there must be two registration periods (summer and winter windows) and the first ""shall begin on the first day of the season. This period may not exceed 12 weeks."" The 2023/24 season begins on 1 July 2023 for most leagues which run from autumn to spring. Therefore, the latest that the summer window could close would be on 23 September 2023. The Saudi Pro League have simply stretched the window to its limits while the Premier League plays by the same rules as the rest of Europe. League Closing date / time (BST) La Liga 01/09/2023 - 23:00 Serie A 01/09/2023 - 19:00 Bundesliga 01/09/2023 - 17:00 Ligue 1 01/09/2023 - 22:00 The Premier League voted to close their summer window in 2018 and 2019 when the season's fixtures began during August, theoretically providing every manager with a settled squad for each match in the first half of the campaign. However, the rest of Europe didn't follow suit, giving those on the continent ample opportunity to poach Premier League stars without any chance of retaliation. After two years, Premier League clubs voted to get back ""in sync"" with the rest of Europe. Now, the continent's elite teams are out of step with the Saudi Pro League - which has already spent more on transfers than La Liga. Whether this will lead to an extension of future summer windows remains to be seen. But there will be no solution for a grumpy Klopp this year."
Virgil van Dijk responds to criticism of Liverpool's transfer business,"Aug 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/virgil-van-dijk-responds-criticism-liverpool-transfer-business,"The Reds made two early splashes in the transfer market this summer by signing Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai for a combined Â£95m, which could grow to Â£115m with the former's add-ons. Liverpool have largely struggled to get any other deals over the line however, seeing three bids rejected by Southampton for Romeo Lavia and interest in defensive options such as Jurrien Timber fizzle out - with the defender instead joining Arsenal.  Coupled with that, the Reds have also let a huge number of first-team players leave the club, particularly in midfielder as captain Jordan Henderson and vice-captain Fabinho both joined Saudi Pro League teams, and the likes of James Milner, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all left as free agents. Long-serving forward Roberto Firmino has also moved on. feed All of this has ultimately led to Liverpool fans being rather unimpressed with the club's transfer business and new club captain Van Dijk admitted that he understands their concerns. ""I can definitely understand it in some ways but I'm not a very negative person,"" he said. ""Obviously, when a lot of players are leaving, when your captain and vice-captain is leaving, and at the moment, there are only two incomings. And the way we have been playing, in possession really good but defensively when you concede goals it's not as good, I can understand some people having doubts. ""Let's see if more players are coming in and then we have to be ready again for a long season. It will be very tough if we look at the teams around us, but we want to be up there again, we want to be challenging again.  ""We have to be confident, we should be confident, and we should still be learning each and every day. There have been characters leaving, players who have played a big part in the success, but others have to step up. That's a nice challenge in my opinion. We should be excited."" The Reds kick-off their 2023/24 Premier League campaign on Sunday against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. "
Arsenal reject Â£30m Monaco bid for Folarin Balogun,"Aug 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-reject-30m-monaco-bid-folarin-balogun,"Balogun returned to the Gunners during the summer after a successful loan spell with Reims in which the forward managed a stunning 21 goals in Ligue 1 for the mid-table team. Despite expectations being high among Gunners fans upon his return to the Emirates, the striker barely featured during a pre-season riddled with injury concerns. Even without a dismal pre-season with Arsenal, Balogun has long been expected to leave the club once again this summer but this time permanently - the player himself stated in June that he ""definitely"" would not go out on loan again. The USMNT international has also consistently rejected the opportunity to enter talks over a new contract at the Emirates Stadium due to the lack of guarantees of game time.  90min reported in July that this resistance to signing a new deal, and unwillingness to go out on loan, has led to Arsenal slapping a Â£50m price tag on the striker. feed Crystal Palace, West Ham United, Brentford, Fulham and UEFA Champions League finalists Inter have all been in contact regarding the player's services, but sources have now confirmed to 90min that Monaco are the first to table an offer.  The Ligue 1 club have made an opening bid of Â£30m which has been swiftly reject by the Gunners, who are holding firm on their Â£50m price tag.  Monaco have stepped up their efforts to sign a new striker following Breel Embolo's ACL injury during a pre-season game. The ailment will see the Swiss forward miss the bulk of the 2023/24 campaign, making the signing of a new starting calibre striker a priority for the principality club.  Along with Balogun, 90min understands that Gift Orban of Gent and reported Chelsea and West Ham target Elye Wahi have also been shortlisted by Monaco. Both forwards have recently held talks with representatives of Tottenham Hotspur."
Xavi responds to rumours linking Neymar with Barcelona return,"Aug 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/xavi-rumours-neymar-barcelona-return,"The Brazilian superstar has been heavily linked with a move away from current club Paris Saint-Germain, with 90min recently revealing that the Ligue 1 giants are working hard to try and move the forward on.  Signed for a world record fee of Â£190m (â¬222m) back in 2017, Neymar has largely disappointed during his time in Ligue 1 due to a myriad of injury concerns. The 31-year-old has never played more than 22 league games in any given season during his six year spell in Paris, and has failed to win the club their first ever UEFA Champions League - being on the losing end in the 2020 final.  Neymar enjoyed a much more successful stint at Barca between 2013 and 2017, winning the Champions League and two La Liga titles as an integral member of the famed 'MSN' frontline.  In light of PSG's interest in selling the player, Neymar has inevitably been linked with a return to his former club Barcelona. 90min understands that club president Joan Laporta is keen to re-sign Neymar, however manager Xavi would prefer if the club targeted Manchester City star Bernardo Silva.  feed Speaking to the press after Barcelona's 4-2 win over Tottenham Hotspur in the Joan Gamper Trophy on Tuesday evening, Xavi was asked about the links with Neymar, saying: ""I cannot say anything more about Neymar. Last year I had mentioned a name of a player from another team and that club got angry. From here until the end of the market, we will see."" Xavi also commented on the need for Barca to bulk their squad further this summer, telling reporters: ""We have to strengthen ourselves well. The sports area and the president know this reality. I'm happy with how our players are training and our pre-season."" Barcelona are likely to face stiff competition from PIF owned Saudi Pro League clubs and potentially Newcastle United, depending on the future direction the club's owners in regards to transfer policy."
West Ham agree Â£30m deal with Southampton for James Ward-Prowse,"Aug 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-agree-30m-deal-southampton-james-ward-prowse,"The Hammers have been desperately trying to strengthen their squad after selling Declan Rice to Arsenal in a British-record Â£105m transfer. Things have been slow moving for West Ham, amid internal conflicts between manager David Moyes and new technical director Tim Steidten, but progress has been made over the past 48 hours on a number of targets. Edson Alvarez has completed a medical in London ahead of a Â£34m move from Ajax, while West Ham have also agreed a Â£30m fee for former Manchester United skipper Harry Maguire - he is now due to discuss personal terms over a move to the East End. And sources have confirmed to 90min that after lengthy negotiations, West Ham have agreed a Â£30m deal with Southampton for Ward-Prowse, with an additional sell-on clause, having seen a bid for the same amount rejected by United for Scott McTominay. feed It had looked as though West Ham's move for central midfielder Ward-Prowse would fall through, with Southampton wanting more money for the 28-year-old, but terms have now been agreed between the two parties ahead of the opening weekend of the Premier League season. It's expected he will sign a four-year contract should he come through a medical unscathed. Ward-Prowse has been at Southampton for the entirety of his career, making 422 appearances on the south coast and scoring 55 goals. He has also provided 55 assists in that time, while his unerring accuracy from free-kicks has drawn comparisons to David Beckham. West Ham hope to complete deals for half a dozen players before the summer window closes, with attention now set to turn to strengthening in the wide forward areas and with a striker."

In a statement, Arsenal sporting director Edu said: ""On behalf of everyone at the club, we would like to thank Matt for his contribution to Arsenal and wish him and his family all the best in their new chapter. ""Matt is an international goalkeeper with the United States and is at a stage of his career when he needs to be playing regularly.

Moises Caicedo: CEO reveals why Brighton 'understand' Chelsea interest,"Aug 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/moises-caicedo-ceo-why-brighton-understand-chelsea-interest,"Caicedo has become one of the best midfielders in the Premier League during his time at the AMEX and attracted interest from both the Blues and Arsenal during the January transfer window. The midfielder asked to leave but Brighton stood firm and have maintained their not-for-sale stance during the summer so far. The youngster is said to have skipped training recently in a bid to force through a move to Stamford Bridge and wasn't involved in Brighton's final pre-season friendly of the summer against Rayo Vallecano. 90min understands Brighton have told Caicedo they will not sell him unless their Â£100m valuation is met. Chelsea are still chasing the 21-year-old and Barber insisted the south coast side do not want him to leave this year. feed He said: ""For a young player like Moises at 21, he's probably one of the best midfield players in the world already at his age, and we've had a fantastic time working with him. And we want it to continue, we've got him under a long contract. ""We're also realistic to know there is interest in him. As a young man, that interest is inevitably going to have an impact on your thought process and unsettle you a little bit. We understand that. ""But for now, he's a Brighton player, he's under contract. We expect him to work hard, prepare for the new season and we'll see what happens as the window goes on. ""The window's got a long way to go, we'd love to keep him. He's a really important player, we'll see where we are."" Brighton lost Leandro Trossard to Arsenal in January and have also sold Alexis Mac Allister and Robert Sanchez to Liverpool and Chelsea this window respectively. However, they have responded with incoming deals for Joao Pedro, Mahmoud Dahoud, James Milner, Bart Verbruggen and Igor Julio. A club-record Â£34.5m deal has also been agreed with Ajax for Ghana forward Mohammed Kudus, though an agreement over personal terms still hasn't been reached."
West Ham reach Â£30m agreement with Man Utd for Harry Maguire,"Aug 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-reach-30m-agreement-man-utd-harry-maguire,"The England international was removed from his position as club captain last month, with Bruno Fernandes taking over the role at Old Trafford. 90min revealed on Monday that West Ham had made a Â£30m bid for Maguire with his long-term future at United uncertain, but the bid was turned down at the time. Part of the reason why United knocked back this offer was the belief that the Hammers would be unable to satisfy Maguire's wage demands, but after West Ham informed the Red Devils on Wednesday their willingness to amend their contract offer to the centre-back, the two clubs have come to an agreement. Though Maguire has not been 100% convinced of leaving Man Utd this transfer window, 90min understands he is open to a move and it looks likely that he will now accept West Ham's offer. feed Should Maguire complete a move to London Stadium, United will make a Â£50m loss on the 30-year-old following his world-record move from Leicester City in 2019 which made him the most expensive defender in football history. Maguire fell out of favour under Erik ten Hag last season, with Lisandro Martinez displacing him from the starting lineup and often featuring alongside Raphael Varane. Victor Lindelof has also usurped Maguire in the pecking order, with Luke Shaw also preferred in a central role at times. West Ham remain interested in Man Utd midfielder Scott McTominay, who was also the subject of a Â£30m bid this week, but the Red Devils are continuing to hold out for a higher fee for the Scotland international. Ajax's Edson Alvarez is close to finalising a move to east London, - he's undergone a medical and is set to pen a five-year deal - while West Ham have also agreed to pay Southampton Â£30m for their captain James Ward-Prowse - a move that may prevent an improved offer being made for McTominay."
West Ham want Lucas Paqueta stay as Man City make verbal offer,"Aug 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-stance-on-lucas-paqueta-future-man-city-70m-bid,"The 25-year-old established himself as a key player in David Moyes' side during the second half of last season, helping the club to a famous win over Fiorentina in the Europa Conference League final. But despite that success, and West Ham's subsequent qualification for the Europa League, Paqueta wasn't overly impressed with how the 2022/23 season went, with 90min exclusively revealing in June that the Brazilian has particular concerns about working under Moyes. Paqueta has had to adapt his style of play to fit into Moyes' system, and although his performance levels significantly improved after the winter World Cup in Qatar, it's clear that the Brazilian's natural instincts are compromised by West Ham sitting deep and looking to hit teams on the counter. The former AC Milan and Lyon midfielder parted company with his long-term agents earlier this summer, and it's understood his new representation have been assessing potential landing spots for Paqueta during the current transfer window.  Paris Saint-Germain showed interest in Paqueta earlier this summer and retain an interest in his services, while the recently appointed director of the Saudi Pro League, Michael Emenalo, is keeping apprised of the midfielder's situation at West Ham. 90min has also learned of significant interest from Premier League champions Manchester City, who have made a verbal offer of Â£70m for Paqueta. West Ham have turned that bid down and have insisted that they do not intend to sell Paqueta, however sources have told 90min that an offer 'too good to turn down' would be considered. feed Whether or not City return for Paqueta remains to be seen, but they certainly have the financial capability to offer West Ham an increased figure - the money at their disposal evidenced by their Â£90m bid for Declan Rice earlier this summer. It's also rare for City to engage in talks unless they have a genuine belief of signing a player. City's interest stems from their desire to replace Ilkay Gundogan and Riyad Mahrez, who have left for Barcelona and Al Ahli respectively, but isn't believed to be connected to a potential sale of Bernardo Silva. 90min recently revealed that Barcelona have made fresh contact with Silva in an attempt to prise the Portuguese international away from City, but they have no intention to sell at this point. Paris Saint-Germain are also interested in the 28-year-old. 90min further understands that Newcastle's long-term interest in Paqueta has not waned, but a deal may be difficult for them to do because of Financial Fair Play regulations. A loan with obligation to buy  appears to be the only way the Magpies could facilitate a move this summer, though that is unlikely to happen at this stage."

Tottenham exploring new striker options despite Harry Kane stance,"Aug 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-new-striker-options-harry-kane,"Bayern Munich have had three bids for Kane knocked back by Spurs already this transfer window and are preparing a fourth worth Â£94.6m (â¬110m). However, 90min understands that Tottenham have showed no indication that this will be enough to convince them to sell their star striker, who has less than a year left to run on his contract. 90min revealed on Tuesday that Kane would like his future sorted before the start of the new Premier League campaign - if he is still at Tottenham by the time they face Brentford on Sunday, he is happy to stay put for the entirety of 2023/24. Tottenham remain hopeful they can convince Kane to commit his long-term future to the club and he has been impressed by new head coach Ange Postecoglou following his appointment in June. Though Spurs are adamant that Kane will not be allowed to leave, they have brought in a new centre forward in Argentina youth international Alejo Veliz this week and could yet sign another this summer. feed Sources have told 90min that representatives of Spurs have sounded out several other strikers regarding potential moves to north London. 21-year-old Gent forward Gift Orban, who has scored a staggering 22 goals in 24 games since joining the Belgian club last year, is one target that Tottenham have spoken to. Chelsea target Elye Wahi of Montpellier and Lille star Jonathan David are also on Spurs' radar, as is wantaway Fulham talisman Aleksandar Mitrovic, who saw a proposed move to Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal fall through earlier this summer. Mitrovic was keen on a move to Saudi Arabia but Al Hilal failed to stump up more than Â£30m, with Fulham demanding closer to Â£50m for the Serbia international. Beyond Kane and Veliz, Brazil's starting number nine Richarlison is also on Tottenham's books and has enjoyed a fruitful pre-season under Postecoglou."
Man City confident star duo will sign new contracts,"Aug 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-city-confident-star-duo-will-sign-new-contracts,"Both players have been considering their futures this summer and had been looking to leave the treble-winners during the transfer window. However, after allowing Riyad Mahrez to join Ilkay Gundogan out the exit door, Man City boss Pep Guardiola and the club's hierarchy have been firm with their stance that Silva and Walker must not be sold as well. 90min revealed earlier this summer that Walker, like Mahrez, was left furious at missing out on the Champions League final and had been looking at his options to leave. A move to former club Sheffield United failed to materialise as their takeover faltered, but the most serious interest emerged from Bayern Munich. Thomas Tuchel has pushed hard to land Walker and they offered the England defender a substantial offer to make the move, but 90min understands that Guardiola has persuaded the 33-year-old to extend his stay with the club. Walker's current deal is due to expire at the end of the 2023/24 season but this will be extended to 2025 with new terms. And the news continues to be positive at Man City as their similarly firm stance on Silva looks set to pay off. feed Silva has been looking to leave the club and there have been no shortage of suitors, with Barcelona pushing hard to sign a player who had long been eyeing a move to Catalonia. PSG were ready to pay Man City their asking price of around Â£80m this summer, but Silva has been told he will not be allowed to leave. While Silva is keen to move on from Man City and has recently reiterated that desire to Guardiola, sources have told 90min that he is accepting there is little chance of any club being able to persuade them to sell. Silva's current deal runs to 2025, which means Man City are not under pressure to sanction a transfer, and because of that a new contract is now close to being finalised. As 90min previously revealed, Man City are willing to make Silva one of the best-paid players at the club and in the Premier League altogether, putting him close to the wage packets of teammates Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne. Man City believe and hope that both Silva and Walker will put pen-to-paper on their new deals by the end of this month."
Barcelona provide update on Ousmane Dembele's proposed PSG move,"Aug 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-update-ousmane-dembele-proposed-psg-move,"The France international was not expected to leave or push for a move away from Catalonia this summer, but PSG triggered his â¬50m (Â£43m) release clause shortly before it expired in July and proceeded to discuss personal terms. During these negotiations, Dembele was called out in public by Barcelona head coach Xavi and club captain Sergi Roberto, who expressed their shock at the sudden move. 90min reported on August 3 that PSG had hoped to wrap up a deal before the end of last week, but a deal has dragged on and reports from the Spanish press suggested talks had stalled. feed But after Dembele was omitted from Barca's squad to take on Tottenham Hotspur in the annual Joan Gamper Trophy on Tuesday night, vice-president Yuste insisted that the transfer will go ahead and confirmation of an agreement is close. ""We're on the verge of resolving Dembele deal with Paris Saint-Germain as all parties want to seal it as soon as possible,"" Yuste said. ""Dembele is not with us tonight as we hope to settle the matter soon. We are on it.""

Chelsea confirmed an extended rejigging of squad numbers prior to confirmation of Gabriel's loan, with the winger not handed one ahead of the new season and suggesting a move away was close to being finalised.

Barcelona unconcerned by Ilkay Gundogan registration clause,"Aug 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-unconcerned-ilkay-gundogan-registration-clause,"Gundogan joined on a free transfer from Manchester City this summer, inking a two-year contract which also includes an option for the midfielder to terminate his deal if he is not registered in Barcelona's squad by the time the new La Liga season kicks off this weekend. Financial restrictions mean Barcelona have not yet registered any of their new singings - Gundogan, Oriol Romeu, Inigo Martinez - as well as any new contracts agreed this summer and the return of loanees like Ez Abde and Fermin Lopez.  As it stands, manager Xavi has just 13 eligible players for the season-opener against Getafe on 13 August, including Ousmane Dembele and Franck Kessie, who are on the cusp of leaving the club. The imminent sales of Dembele and Kessie, to Paris Saint-Germain and Al Ahli respectively, are expected to net Barcelona around â¬65m (Â£56m), while talks are also on over a 16% sale of Barca Studios which would provide another cash injection. feed Sources have confirmed to 90min that Barcelona are confident they will wrap up their outstanding deals in time to register Gundogan and the rest of their new signings before the new season gets underway. As was the case with Gavi earlier this summer when the midfielder's contract extension was delayed, Gundogan is not causing problems behind the scene and is not contemplating an early exit from Camp Nou. While Barcelona understand their current situation, sources close to the club insist they are confident they have the financial capacity to register all their new signings - a stance exemplified by ongoing efforts to sign Manchester City duo Bernardo Silva and Joao Cancelo. Gundogan and the rest of Barcelona's new signings can be registered up to and including the day of the Getafe game, and club officials are optimistic everything will be finalised in time."

Raya has been determined to secure a move to the Emirates Stadium and he is expected to undergo a medical shortly. feed The Gunners have long-admired Raya and tried to sign him back in 2020, but were unable to get a deal over the line. Arsenal goalkeeper coach Inaki Cana worked with the Spaniard during his brief spell at Brentford. Raya will provide competition for England international Aaron Ramsdale though is not expected to be the immediate first-choice goalkeeper at Arsenal. Since Brentford were promoted from the Championship in 2021, Raya has proven to be one of the Premier League's leading goalkeepers due to his shot-stopping and ability to play from the back.

While Veliz arrives to bolster Spurs' attacking options, his arrival is unlikely to have much bearing on the future of Harry Kane. 90min understands that Kane will stay put in north London for the 2023/24 season if a move away does not transpire before the new Premier League campaign begins this weekend.

Fortunately for Liverpool fans, Salah's agent has already publicly shot down the rumours, insisting the Egyptian does not want to leave Anfield this summer.

While some are encouraging an improved bid, others believe they are fighting a losing battle and are keen to start looking elsewhere. Scouts have drawn up reports on alternative targets, with the likes of Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic and Eintracht Frankfurt's Randal Kolo Muani on Bayern's radar."
Micky van de Ven joins Tottenham from Wolfsburg,"Aug 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/micky-van-de-ven-joins-tottenham-from-wolfsburg,"As 90min reported earlier this month, Spurs agreed a Â£43m deal with Wolfsburg for Van de Ven. He has now signed a six-year contract at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium until 2029. Van de Ven has already been assigned the number 37 shirt most recently worn by Kyle Walker-Peters and previously owned by Harry Kane in his earliest days with the first-team. The 22-year-old Dutchman is yet to make his senior international debut but was named in the Netherlandsâ 2022 World Cup preliminary squad and has captained his country at Under-21 level. feed Van de Ven is the fifth new face at Tottenham this summer after Giuglielmo Vicario, James Maddison, Manor Solomon and Ashley Phillips. The Â£43m price tag eclipses the Â£40m that Spurs agreed with Leicester to sign Maddison back in June. Dejan Kulusevski and Pedro Porro have both also joined on permanent transfers after loan spells. Van de Ven was born in the town of Wormer, near Amsterdam. He was drafted into the youth ranks of local North Holland club FC Volendam from the age of 12, progressing to the second division clubâs first-team by the age of 18 and moving to Wolfsburg two years later. Having been a regular with Volendam, Van de Ven was initially a fringe player in a debut season in Germany that was also hampered by injury. But he firmly established himself during a breakout 2022/23 and started all but one of Wolfsburgâs 34 Bundesliga games."
Newcastle confirm fourth signing of the summer transfer window,"Aug 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/newcastle-confirm-fourth-signing-summer-transfer-window,"A fee of around Â£35m, plus a further Â£5m in add-ons, has been paid by Newcastle, with around 40% of that sum heading to Livramento's boyhood club Chelsea as a result of a sell-on clause included in his 2021 switch to St Mary's Stadium. Livramento has now put pen to paper on a five-year contract to become Newcastle's fourth signing of the summer after Sandro Tonali, Harvey Barnes and Yankuba Minteh. ""I'm really excited to have signed for Newcastle United and I'm looking forward to playing in front of the fans,"" Livramento told club media. ""I was here for the games over the weekend; even though they were friendlies, there were so many fans and they were still so loud so I can't wait to see what it feels like to play in front of them in a Premier League or Champions League game. ""The way the manager plays football is really attractive and I feel like it suits me as a player. And with how well the team did last season, the trajectory that we're on now, I'm just looking forward to being a part of that. ""And to be able to learn from Kieran Trippier is another big thing for me; hopefully he teaches me how to become a better player and a better full-back."" feed Manager Eddie Howe added: ""Tino is a very talented young player with an exciting future ahead of him so we are delighted to sign him. ""At 20, he already has lots of attributes that I admire but he also has the potential and drive to really grow with this team. I'm looking forward to working with him and to seeing him develop in a Newcastle shirt."" Livramento will now compete for minutes at right-back with 32-year-old Trippier but is also comfortable further forward up the field."
PSG pushing for Neymar to leave as PIF consider Saudi Pro League bid,"Aug 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-neymar-pif-saudi-pro-league-bid,"Neymar has been unsettled for months in the French capital but his team of representatives, led by his father, insist that they are not leading the push for an exit. The 31-year-old's father, Neymar Da Silva Santos, was quick to deny reports from French daily L'Equipe which stated that the Brazilian had told PSG that he wants to leave the club. ""I can't confirm a news that didn't happen. L'Equipe being L'Efake, this came from somewhere, let's try to understand the intention,"" the senior Neymar told PL Brasil. Sources have told 90min that while Neymar is unsettled, it is PSG who are working hard to try and move him on. A return to Barcelona has been mooted but, although president Joan Laporta is believed to be keen, manager Xavi is not believed to be looking at Neymar as a realistic target - instead preferring they focus on Manchester City's Bernardo Silva. Chelsea have also been linked, with club owner Todd Boehly a confirmed fan, but the Blues have not yet indicated any desire to make a move for Neymar this summer despite being contacted by those working on the deal. Contact has also been made with representatives of the Saudi Pro League and the Public Investment Fund (PIF), who also own Newcastle. PIF would love to lure Neymar to St James' Park but would also consider recruiting the 31-year-old for one of their Saudi outfits: Al Ittihad, Al Nassr, Al Ahli or Al Hilal. feed PSG are currently locked in talks with PIF over the potential sale of midfielder Marco Verratti, but they are struggling to agree a fee as they demand nearly double the initial â¬30m (Â£26m) offer that has come in. It was during these conversations that Neymar's name was first mentioned. 90min understands that Verratti remains unhappy with the treatment of both Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, who has been put up for sale and banished from first-team training after refusing to extend his contract. Verratti has made those concerns known to the club's hierarchy. New manager Luis Enrique is keen to keep the Italian but is believed to be open to parting ways with Neymar this summer. PSG are already working hard on new signings for Enrique and have bolstered in attack with the signing of Goncalo Ramos, who has joined on an initial loan from Benfica which comes with an option for a permanent â¬80m (Â£69m) move to the French capital next summer. Eintracht Frankfurt's Randal Kolo Muani is also a key target and personal terms have been agreed with the 24-year-old."

PSG confirm Goncalo Ramos loan signing with buy option,"Aug 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-confirm-goncalo-ramos-loan-signing-buy-option,"The 22-year-old forward, who scored a hat-trick against Switzerland in the last 16 of the 2022 World Cup, joins on loan until the end of the season when PSG will have the option to make it a permanent deal. Benfica had hoped for a fee in the region of Â£69m for Ramos, who previously attracted interest from Manchester United. He told the club's website: ""I'm very proud and happy to join Paris Saint-Germain. PSG are one of the biggest clubs in the world with one of the best squads."" Ramos scored 19 goals in 30 Primeira Liga appearances last season as Benfica won their 38th Portuguese top-flight title. feed With the future of Kylian Mbappe anything but certain, PSG have moved in the summer market to secure new goal threats. While Lionel Messi has departed, the likes of Marco Asensio, Xavi Simons, Lucas Hernandez and Manuel Ugarte have arrived at Parc des Prices in recent weeks. The signings are expected to continue, with Barcelona winger Ousmane Dembele closing in on a â¬43m to the Ligue 1 champions.

Man Utd reject West Ham offers for Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay,"Aug 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-reject-west-ham-offers-harry-maguire-scott-mctominay,"West Ham saw an opening offer for former captain Maguire worth Â£20m rebuffed last month before a more recent second proposal of Â£30m was also dismissed by United. The Hammers also firmed up their interest in another United star in the shape of Scottish midfielder McTominay but, like with Maguire, the Red Devils were not willing to do business at the Â£30m mark. 90min understands the actual offers were not too far away from United's valuation, but the overall deals including the wages West Ham could afford or were willing to provide were not sufficient enough to tempt the Old Trafford giants into selling either player. United, who themselves have spent more than Â£100m this summer on Andre Onana, Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund, are anxious to move players on to finance other deals and Erik ten Hag has sanctioned the departures of both Maguire and McTominay.  However, neither player is desperate to move. feed Maguire remains unconvinced that his future is best served away from the club despite having the captaincy stripped, while McTominay also believes he could yet play his way into Ten Hag's plans given fellow midfielders Donny van de Beek and Fred are expected to move this summer.  West Ham - who are the only team to make firm offers for either Maguire or McTominay this summer - are now considering improved bids for the two players. They are also looking to complete the signing of Ajax midfielder Edson Alvarez in the coming days."
Transfer notebook: Arsenal firm on Jorginho sale; PSG pushing for Kolo Muani,"Aug 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/transfer-notebook-arsenal-firm-jorginho-sale-psg-kolo-muani,"The Gunners recruited the Italy international back in January and he has since courted maintained interest from Serie A sides Lazio and Juventus. While a good offer would be enough for Arsenal to sell Jorginho - much like teammate Thomas Partey's current situation - 90min understands he isn't in talks with Turkish side Fenerbahce and an exit is not currently on the cards. Arsenal are preparing to let goalkeeper Matt Turner depart after agreeing an Â£8m deal with Nottingham Forest for the USMNT international. Turner joined Arsenal in 2022 as back-up to Aaron Ramsdale and featured at the 2022 World Cup with the United States. Forest used Dean Henderson and Keylor Navas as goalies last season. Steve Cooper's side still like Manchester United's Henderson, but their preference for a loan deal due to his injury record differs to United favouring a permanent move. Roma defender Roger Ibanez was also a target for Forest, with talks over a â¬30m deal being held, but he has instead elected to join Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli. Napoli midfielder Piotr Zielinski is another player who will soon seal a move to the Middle East. Poland international Zielinski, who was a key figure in his side's historic Serie A title win last season, will soon confirm his move to Al Ahli, where Roberto Firmino, Allan Saint-Maximin and Edouard Mendy have all relocated this summer. Napoli are targeting Teun Koopmeiners and Gabri Veiga as potential replacements. Atalanta aren't looking to sell Koopmeiners for any less than â¬50m, while a â¬30m offer for Veiga was rejected by Celta Vigo. Paris Saint-Germain have agreed personal terms with Eintracht Frankfurt striker Randal Kolo Muani and a deal is close to completion. PSG see Kolo Muani as their ideal replacement for Kylian Mbappe and talks accelerated over the weekend. Youngster Hugo Ekitike was offered during negotiations, a player Frankfurt are appreciative of. The Ligue 1 champions are still tracking Joao Felix's situation, though favour a loan deal which they could pursue towards the end of the month. The Portugal forward also has an offer from Al Ahli but wants to stay in Europe. feed Burnley are ready to seize on Sheffield United's instability by pursuing a deal for Norwegian midfielder Sander Berge. The Blades have already lost Iliman Ndiaye this month and are ready to sell their other star midfielder to the Clarets. Berge only has a year left on his contract and has turned down fresh advances from United. Should a deal be agreed, Berge will still need to come through a medical, having seen a switch to Fulham in January fall through because of a knock. Burnley are also keen to wrap up a deal for Ajax striker Mohamed Daramy but face competition from Reims, who have entered the bidding late on in their search for a replacement for Folarin Balogun. Crystal Palace are in talks with Bayer Leverkusen over a loan move for centre-back Odilon Kossounou. Palace are looking to add to their options in central defence where Marc Guehi and Joachim Andersen have impressed and a deal with a â¬25m obligation to buy has been put forward.

Chelsea contact Tyler Adams representatives ahead of expected Leeds exit,"Aug 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-contact-tyler-adams-representatives-leeds-exit,"Adams played for the USMNT at the 2022 World Cup and was relegated with Leeds in his first season in the Premier League having joined from RB Leipzig for Â£15m. Adams suffered a hamstring injury in March and didn't add to his 24 league appearances thereafter. Leeds accepted they would likely lose Adams and international teammate Brenden Aaronson following their relegation to the Championship. Aaronson has since joined Union Berlin on loan, while Adams previously attracted interest from Newcastle. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea have now enquired over his availability. Adams has a release worth around Â£25m and the Blues believe the midfielder would slot in well in west London. Leeds expect the 24-year-old to leave Elland Road by the end of the month, with Chelsea not the only Premier League side interested. Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester United, Brighton and Brentford are all keeping tabs on the situation. feed Adams was in attendance for Leeds' opening Championship game of the season against Cardiff on Sunday as his side rescued a 2-2 draw thanks to goals from Liam Cooper and Crysencio Summerville. Chelsea have signed exciting talent like Nicolas Jackson and Christopher Nkunku so far this window but are light in midfield after the departures of Mason Mount, N'Golo Kante and Ruben Loftus-Cheek. Rennes star Lesley Ugochukwu has recently joined the options at Mauricio Pochettino's disposal which include Enzo Fernandez, Conor Gallagher and Andrey Santos. Moises Caicedo is a high-profile target for Pochettino and Todd Boehly but no agreement with Brighton has been reached. The Ecuador international has a price tag of Â£100m and missed the Seagulls' final pre-season friendly of the summer against Rayo Vallecano on Sunday."
Southampton reject Liverpool's third bid for Romeo Lavia,"Aug 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/southampton-reject-liverpool-third-bid-romeo-lavia,"The 19-year-old has been attracting the interest of Chelsea and Arsenal for the best part of a year, but Liverpool have shot to the front of the queue of interested parties after allowing central midfield duo Jordan Henderson and Fabinho to head to the riches of Saudi Arabia. The Reds saw an opening offer of Â£35m immediately rejected by recently-relegated Southampton, before an improved bid for Lavia worth Â£42m was also rebuffed. Southampton have maintained throughout negotiations that they want at least Â£50m for Lavia, and 90min understands they have held their ground after receiving a third Liverpool offer, worth Â£45m in total. Liverpool remain keen to tie up a deal for Lavia and crucially have not walked away from negotiations - indicating that they may be willing to raise their offer once more in order to get a deal over the line. feed Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai have already arrived at Anfield this summer, from Brighton and RB Leipzig respectively, but there's an appetite for Liverpool to conclude further business in a bid to get back into the Premier League title mix. Jurgen Klopp has seen not only Henderson and Fabinho depart, but also Naby Keita, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and James Milner from the midfield ranks - Lavia's potential arrival an indication of a changing of the guard on Merseyside. Fluminense's Andre Trindade is regarded as a viable alternative to Lavia, should Liverpool not be able to iron things out with Southampton, while the club may also look to sign a centre-back before the summer window slams shut."
West Ham return with Â£30m offer for Harry Maguire,"Aug 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-30m-offer-harry-maguire,"The Hammers are looking to strengthen their squad with as many as six signings before the transfer window closes, but have only signed Cliftonville youngster Sean Moore to date. The club is yet to splash any of the immediate cash received from Declan Rice's Â£105m British-record move to Arsenal. A deal for Ajax midfielder Edson Alvarez is nearing completion after a fee was agreed and West Ham have now returned with another offer for Maguire after an initial approach was knocked back at the end of July. Sources have confirmed to 90min that West Ham's new bid is worth Â£30m, though any deal, should United decide the fee is enough, is likely to hinge on the 13-time Premier League winners continuing to contribute towards Maguire's hefty wages. United manager Erik ten Hag has established Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez as his first-choice centre-back duo at Old Trafford, with Victor Lindelof and Luke Shaw, naturally a left-back, also ahead of Maguire in the pecking order for places. feed Maguire has also been stripped of the club captaincy this summer, in favour of appointing Bruno Fernandes, and United are willing to sanction his exit if they receive an offer that they believe reflects his market value - they paid Leicester Â£80m for his services in 2019. West Ham are continuing to show interest in Maguire's United team-mate Scott McTominay, sources have further confirmed to 90min. An offer of Â£30m has been made by the Hammers for the 26-year-old Scot and talks are ongoing between the two clubs over a potential deal. The Hammers have returned to McTominay after deciding against pursuing Southampton's James Ward-Prowse. However, neither Maguire nor McTominay are itching to leave Old Trafford, with both players hopeful of featuring in the new season. Monaco's Youssouf Fofana is another player front and centre of technical director Tim Steidten's transfer plans, with West Ham also wanting to sign a left-back and striker before the window closes on September 1."

Tottenham reject Bayern Munich record bid for Harry Kane,"Aug 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-reject-bayern-munich-record-bid-harry-kane,"Bayern have been keen on landing Kane ever since Robert Lewandowski joined Barcelona last summer. They had already seen two offers rejected by Tottenham earlier this summer, but left a recent meeting between club representatives feeling optimistic about a deal being struck, before then entering their third bid worth â¬100m (Â£86m). That figure was both a record for Bayern, far exceeding what they paid for Lucas Hernandez in 2019, as well as Tottenham, who sold Gareth Bale to Real Madrid for Â£85m in 2013. Despite Bayern wanting a quick decision from Spurs, the Premier League side took their time in relaying a response. 90min understands that the answer has been given and it remains ânoâ. Bayern had made it clear that it was their best and final offer, but are currently considering whether or not to return with a fourth proposal for the England captain. feed Although optimistic at the start of August, Bayern have also started to weigh up other options once more. One alternative is Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic, who has already asked for a transfer this summer following a sub-par season in Serie A. Bayern have been in touch with his representatives, although Juventus have also been in touch with Chelsea regarding a Romelu Lukaku plus cash swap. Another striker Bayern have long kept an eye on is Randal Kolo Muani at Eintracht Frankfurt, the â¬100m (Â£86m) asking price, despite matching the offer for Kane, is not something they want to pay. Rather, Paris Saint-Germain have emerged as favourites for France international Kolo Muani. Personal terms have already been agreed following talks over the weekend, with the club expected to follow suit and agree a transfer fee between them. PSG are also willing to offer Hugo Ekitike, whose loan from Reims was made permanent in June, in part-exchange."
Edson Alvarez: Ajax midfielder undergoing medical at West Ham,"Aug 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/edson-alvarez-ajax-medical-west-ham,"Sources have confirmed to 90min that an agreement has been reached in principle over a deal worth Â£34m, with the Mexico international one of West Ham's top targets to replace Declan Rice. The Hammers have endured a frustrating transfer window so far, amid clashes between manager David Moyes and technical director Tim Steidten over targets, and have seen bids for Joao Palhinha, Conor Gallagher and James Ward-Prowse turned down. Manchester United's Scott McTominay has also been on the radar, but Alvarez, alongside Monaco's Youssouf Fofana, is a player that Steidten has been pushing for West Ham to sign. 90min revealed on Sunday that talks were ongoing with Dutch giants Ajax over a fee for Alvarez, who has long indicated his desire to move to the Premier League, and sources have now confirmed that an agreement has been reached over a deal that could eventually be worth Â£34m. Alvarez was close to joining Borussia Dortmund earlier this summer but a deal to move to the Bundesliga runners-up fell through at the 11th hour. feed 26-year-old Alvarez has also been on the radar of Manchester United and Chelsea over the past 12 months, though both clubs have moved on to secure other targets and their interest has subsequently cooled. West Ham hope that Alvarez, who is expected to sign a long-term contract barring any last minute complications, will be the first of up to half a dozen new signings at London Stadium. The club are gearing up to compete in the Europa League after winning last season's Conference League, but haven't added to their squad yet and have seen captain Rice leave for Arsenal in a British-record Â£105m deal. Another central midfield arrival is high up on West Ham's transfer agenda, while they would also like to sign a new central defender, left back and centre forward as a minimum - the need for the latter highlighted further by the club agreeing to send Gianluca Scamacca back to Italy just 12 months into a five-year deal. Atalanta confirmed his arrival from West Ham in a deal worth Â£26m on Monday, allowing the Premier League side to recoup the majority of the money they paid Sassuolo in July 2022."
Bayern Munich draw up list of Harry Kane alternatives,"Aug 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-list-harry-kane-alternatives,"Sources confirmed to 90min last week that Bayern Munich had made a club record Â£86m (â¬100m) bid to sign Tottenham talisman Kane this summer, having previously seen two offers rejected by Daniel Levy and co. in recent weeks.  As things stand, the Bundesliga holders are yet to receive a response from Tottenham regarding their most recent offer and have had no indication that it will be accepted.  Due to this uncertainty, Bayern officials have opted to draw up a list of alternative targets if a deal to sign Kane does not materliase.  feed 90min understands that one such alternative target is Dusan Vlahovic of Juventus. The forward asked to leave Juve in June - a request that was given its blessing by manager Massimiliano Allegri - following a disappointing 2022/23 campaign in Turin in which he managed just 10 Serie A goals.  Bayern have now made contact with Vlahovic's representatives in order to check in on the player's current situation at Juventus. 90min recently reported that Vlahovic's current employers have made attempts to get rid of the forward this summer already. The club has proposed a swap deal with Chelsea that would see the Serbian move to Stamford Bridge in exchange for Romelu Lukaku plus cash.  While Chelsea have held talks with Vlahovic's camp, they are not keen on the aforementioned deal as they are not interested in paying a fee in additiona to parting with Lukaku to get the forward.  Another striker that Bayern have shortlisted is France international and Eintracht Frankfurt star Randal Kolo Muani. The emerging talent has been linked with Bayern earlier this year, however 90min understands that Frankfurt's asking price of Â£86m is not a fee that the club would be willing to pay.  Paris Saint-Germain are currently favourite to sign Kolo Muani, with the player already agreeing personal terms after talks accelerated over the weekend. Sources have confirmed to 90min that a deal is also likely to be agreed between the clubs soon, and a significant reason for that is PSG being willing offer Hugo Ekitike in part-exchange.  Kolo Muani is seen by PSG as an ideal replacement for Kylian Mbappe in plans for life without their superstar forward due to his current contract situation and desire to join Real Madrid. "
Barcelona working hard to sign Bernardo Silva from Manchester City,"Aug 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-working-sign-bernardo-silva-manchester-city,"City have already informed Silva and his entourage that they do no want to sell him this summer and have outlined their plans to make him one of the highest paid players at the club alongside Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland. However, with Barca's interest reigniting, 90min understands Silva has again made it clear to City and Guardiola that he would like to leave the club - the Portuguese international said the same 12 months ago but was asked to stay for another season, at which point the Premier League champions would look at letting him leave as long as their valuation of around Â£80m was met. But the departures of Riyad Mahrez and Ilkay Gundogan have seen City change their stance on Silva and now insist they can't afford to let him leave, even if a club agree to meet the valuation - something Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain have already indicated they would be willing to do. Now Barca, who are set to pocket nearly Â£60m from the sales of Ousmane Dembele and Franck Kessie, are trying to package together a deal that will convince City to let Silva go, having previously thought a deal was unattainable because of their precarious finances. feed Barca are also locked in talks with City over the future of Joao Cancelo, who has agreed personal terms, and they hope they can come to agreement that will take both Portugal internationals to Catalonia this summer - but sources have told 90min that as it stands City will not sell. Speaking after City's Community Shield defeat to Arsenal, which featured Silva from the start, manager Pep Guardiola was asked about his future and also that of Bayern Munich target Kyle Walker, who also featured at Wembley. âHeâs [Walker] super important for us.

And if Moises stays, I will be happy for us, for the team, for the club. But itâs not my problem now. If Moises leaves, we will bring another player in.

A world record bid from Al Hilal was accepted by the club but rejected by Mbappe himself, while Premier League sides like Chelsea have been contacted but are not confident of convincing the Frenchman, whose focus remains on Madrid.

Mohamed remains committed to LFC. 90min understands there has been and remains interest from the Saudi Pro League in Salah. There have been enquiries, although the Liverpool star has primarily always been considered a target for 2024 or beyond, rather than necessarily this year. It means the matter isn't likely to be closed. feed Salah, whose Liverpool contract still has two years left to run, has played plenty of minutes in pre-season, currently sits sixth on the Reds' all-time scoring charts and was recently tipped to climb even higher in the standings by current record holder Ian Rush.

""He would have to be there a good few more years if he is going to break that record. He plays a bit more of a wide role now. I don't think he has scored as many goals but I think he made just as many assists this year. ""He has become more of a team player. A couple of years ago, he was maybe being a little selfish.

Football becomes pointless if Tottenham cave in and sell Harry Kane,"Aug 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/football-becomes-pointless-if-tottenham-sell-harry-kane,"From mid-2018 to the start of 2020, the striker became dogged by injuries, stripping him of a yard of pace and essentially pencilling him in for around ten games on the sidelines during any given season. By the time he effectively had back-to-back pre-seasons to reset his body during the pandemic, Spurs had fully committed to Jose Mourinho. Kane took on not only more of the scoring load alongside Son Heung-min, but also shouldered the creative burden. Through the Mourinho, Nuno Espirito Santo and Antonio Conte eras, Kane had to do everything in order to maintain Tottenham's attacking potency. Enter Ange Postecoglou, a head coach drafted in to restore Spurs' long-forgotten attacking principles. Kane scored Spurs' first four in a 5-1 pre-season thrashing of Shakhtar Donetsk on Sunday as they flexed their new identity back on home soil. For the first time since the days of Mauricio Pochettino, Tottenham are looking to play on the front foot, to dominate the ball, to suffocate teams with possession and chances. When Kane was substituted towards the end of the match, he was met with a standing ovation, his iconic chant sung loudly from all four corners of the ground. Just as it had after each of his four goals, just as it had before a ball had even been kicked this afternoon. Today's script may as well have been written by our new AI and ChatGPT overlords - once Kane was on the bench, a dark cloud emerged over the stadium. The heavens opened for five minutes before the sun began to reappear again. Heading into Sunday's encounter, Spurs were continuing to mull over a new bid from Bayern Munich worth Â£86m. It could well be their last in a saga which is nearing an end. If Tottenham choose to cash in on Kane, they stop any risk of him walking away for free next summer when his contract expires. It's become clear that this is a risk they must take. Kane became the club's all-time leading scorer back in February when he grabbed the only goal in a remarkable 1-0 victory at home to eventual treble-winners Manchester City. At full-time, he was celebrated and heralded for his remarkable achievements. That's when it first sunk in - Tottenham Hotspur are Harry Kane, and Harry Kane is Tottenham Hotspur. manual If under-fire chairman Daniel Levy agrees to sell the club's greatest ever player, he would tank his already negative approval rating to ungodly levels. If Kane walks for free, Spurs miss out on a hefty fee for the balance sheet, but at least he can say he kept the striker for all six years of his contract, tried his darnedest to extend that deal. It's an incredibly rare feat for an academy graduate to become the face and soul of their boyhood club, especially in the super-club age. Tottenham should cherish this as long as they possibly can, kick the replacement striker can down the road for another year at least. If building a billion-pound stadium was meant to bridge the gap to the elite in the transfer market, it should also be able to absolve such a financial loss. There is, also, the Postecoglou factor. Kane scored 30 Premier League goals last season, his joint-best total despite sorry Spurs limping to an eighth place finish. In theory, he would be able to rival Erling Haaland for the Golden Boot in a team which creates bucketloads of chances rather than being drip-fed them. ""He's a fantastic striker, one of the world's best. I think the way the team plays will help him as well. He loves scoring goals and you saw today we created a load of chances and he was the beneficiary of that,"" Postecoglou said on Sunday. Tottenham still believe they could yet convince Kane to sign a new contract. This is more of a last chance than a last dance. The cruel world of modern football needs both to go through with it."

West Ham continue to negotiate Edson Alvarez transfer fee,"Aug 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-continue-negotiate-edson-alvarez-transfer-fee,"Alvarez has emerged as one of West Ham's top targets this summer, and is the choice of recently appointed technical director Tim Steidten. Steidten and manager David Moyes have been struggling to agree on targets throughout the summer. That has now seen West Ham switch focus to Alvarez after failing to seal deals for Southampton's James Ward-Prowse and Manchester United's Scott McTominay. West Ham, despite the record sale of Declan Rice, have yet to make a breakthrough in the transfer market and that plight was highlighted at the weekend as they were hammered 4-0 by Bayer Leverkusen - ironically Steidten's former club. He has now pushed ahead with a move for Alvarez in an attempt to get something done before the start of the Premier League season next weekend. feed Now, West Ham have made an initial offer Â£25.9m for Alvarez. Although that isn't considered enough by Ajax, who are seeking just over Â£30m, talks have continued and are at an advanced stage. Alvarez was a target for Chelsea last year and almost joined Borussia Dortmund earlier this summer, before that deal fell through to give West Ham the opportunity to try and land him. 90min understands the Hammers are looking to bring in up to six players before the summer window closes and getting the Alvarez deal over the line is seen as a key breakthrough in the transfer market."

Brighton agree club record fee for Ajax star Mohammed Kudus,"Aug 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/brighton-agree-club-record-fee-ajax-star-mohammed-kudus,"Brighton have been tracking Kudus all summer, as 90min has already revealed, and now they have pushed ahead and finalised the terms of a deal with Ajax.  The Seagulls have met Ajax's asking price of â¬40m (Â£34.5m) and that would surpass their existing club record move set earlier this summer when Joao Pedro completed his move from Watford. Kudus has now been given the green light to agree personal terms with Brighton, a detail that has not yet been finalised. Brighton are working hard to persuade him that moving to AMEX Stadium is his best next step, with manager Roberto De Zerbi convinced that the Ghanaian is an ideal signing. feed As 90min has previously revealed, Kudus has been targeted by Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United in recent months - all have reached out to his representatives this summer and hold an interest. But none of them have made firm offers at this point, leaving Brighton in pole position to complete a deal. Kudus is currently in Germany with Ajax ahead of their pre-season clash with Borussia Dortmund on Sunday afternoon, but it remains to be seen if he will feature."
Potential destinations for Folarin Balogun this summer,"Aug 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/potential-destinations-for-folarin-balogun-this-summer,"This time last year, few would have known too much about the young Arsenal striker, but following an impressive loan spell with Stade Reims in Ligue 1, the 22-year-old is now one of the most exciting young forwards in Europe and a USMNT international. Scoring 22 goals in 39 games for Reims last season, he is now being targeted by a number of top clubs. However, 90min understands that Arsenal value Balogun at Â£50m, which may put off some potential suitors. The Gunners have told Balogun he can find a new club with no obvious route into the first team as Gabriel Jesus, Eddie Nketiah and new signing Kai Havertz stand in his path. There will be many clubs knocking on his agent's door this summer, but where he will end up is still unclear. feed Having come within 90 minutes of Champions League glory last season, things promise to be more complicated for Inter this term. Andre Onana, Marcelo Brozovic, Edin Dzeko and Romelu Lukaku will not be at the club next season as Simone Inzaghi is responsible for something of a rebuild in key areas this summer. One position that needs strengthening in the window is up front. Having brought in Marcus Thuram on a free transfer to help Lautaro Martinez, Inzaghi is keen to reinforce his attacking unit further having lost two key centre-forward options. Balogun is one of the players Inter have been in contact with over a potential move to San Siro. More similar in profile to Martinez than Thuram, Balogun could offer depth and quality in attack. The forward has huge potential and could develop further in Serie A under Inzaghi's tutelage, but that Â£50m fee would likely be unworkable for Inter. Considering West Ham are the only Premier League club yet to make a signing this window, David Moyes would probably be thankful to get anybody through the door at the London Stadium. The Â£105m departure of Declan Rice means the Hammers have a huge budget to work with, but they have still been unable to get any deals done. Atalanta, who are a club linked with Balogun themselves, have agreed a deal for Irons forward Gianluca Scamacca after an unsuccessful stint with West Ham. Not only will this add another Â£26m to available funds, it will free up a space up front that needs filling. Balogun could be the man to fill the gap, posing a completely different skillset to the departing Scamacca. Balogun's pace and nous for finding space in the penalty area could make him a prime target to add more goals to a sometimes blunt West Ham side. A return to Ligue 1 could be on the cards for Balogun, who would certainly need no time in readjusting to life in France. Lille finished fifth last season and qualified for the Europa Conference League, but would likely find it difficult to raise the required funds to prise Balogun away from north London. Paulo Fonseca's side have lost a couple of forward players in Timothy Weah and Jonathan Bamba this summer and need greater depth in attacking areas. Balogun, however, may be too far out of their price range. Jordan Ayew, Odsonne Edouard and Jean-Philippe Mateta are hardly the most awe-inspiring attacking trio in the Premier League. The three strikers have all struggled for consistency since arriving at Selhurst Park, and with Wilfried Zaha's exit, Palace need more goals next year. Michael Olise's potential departure would only exacerbate this issue, but Balogun could be the solution. The 22-year-old's ability to run in behind opposition defences makes him a completely different proposition to the Eagles' current centre-forward options. Similarly to Lille, however, Palace would be unlikely to splash Â£50m on untested Premier League player, knowing a better could be found deal somewhere else in Europe. Ivan Toney scored 20 goals in 33 Premier League games last season but will not be available to Brentford until January 2024 following a ban for breaching betting rules. While Bryan Mbuemo, Kevin Schade, and Yoane Wissa are all capable of providing goals for the Bees next year, they won't be able to offer the same consistency as Toney. Balogun showcased his ability to score weekly for Reims last season, although doing it in the Premier League is admittedly a different proposition.  Balogun is also a different profile striker to Toney and is not quite as adept at holding the ball up and winning physical battles. Given Brentford just spent around Â£20m on Schade following his move from Freiburg, they may not be in a position to spend big on Balogun."
Chelsea make Â£17m offer for teenage Brazilian striker,"Aug 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-make-17m-offer-teenage-brazilian-striker,"The Blues have not been afraid to splash the cash in the second summer under BlueCo, whose acquisition of Ligue 1 side Strasbourg has seen them step up their pursuits of a number of young talents who could hone their craft in France. There are hopes to use Strasbourg to finally get a deal for Russian starlet Arsen Zakharyan over the line, while Montpellier striker Elye Wahi could be loaned to the French side if a deal can be struck with his current employers. A decision must be made on new midfielder recruit Lesley Ugochukwu and Brazilian winger Angelo, who joined from Santos earlier this summer, has also been tipped for a move to Strasbourg. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea have once again returned to Santos with an offer for 18-year-old Washington. feed A bid of an initial Â£13m, plus a further Â£4m in add-ons, has been lodged by the Blues, who are trying to negotiate a discount on Santos' Â£26m asking price. Clubs across Europe have been following Washington, with Monaco ready to match Chelsea's Â£15m bid if it is accepted, but the Stamford Bridge outfit are working to win the race for his signature and could loan the teenager to Strasbourg if a deal is struck. Ligue 1 rules mean Chelsea can loan just three players out to Strasbourg, who must also adhere to the rule of having no more than four non-EU players on their books, so alternative strategies will have to be taken for some of these proposed loans. Washington has managed 16 senior appearances for Santos and has scored two goals, both of which came in consecutive outings in May."
Chelsea in talks over loan exits for Lewis Hall & Cesare Casadei,"Aug 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-talks-loan-exits-lewis-hall-cesare-casadei,"Hall, 18, made his breakthrough into the senior side last season, seeing a number of appearances at left-back under Frank Lampard despite most of his academy training coming as a central midfielder. Chelsea have plenty of competition for minutes at left-back, with Ian Maatsen's sensational loan with Burnley seeing him kept in a squad which already includes both Ben Chilwell and Marc Cucurella, and now 90min understands a loan move is on the cards for Hall. Talks are on with Crystal Palace, who are looking to sign Hall on a loan deal which would not include a purchase clause. Chelsea are huge believers in Hall, who has three years remaining on his contract, and want to see the teenager back at Stamford Bridge next summer. The negotiations over Hall are being kept separate from those involving Palace's Michael Olise, for whom Chelsea are confident of getting a deal over the line. feed Hall is expected to be followed out of the door by 20-year-old Casadei who, after six months on loan with Reading last season, is set to get his next taste of senior football with Leicester City. Chelsea had hoped to find a top-flight suitor for Casadei, whose meteoric rise to prominence continued with a stunning Under-20 World Cup campaign this summer, but believe the chance to work under new Foxes boss Enzo Maresca towards the top of the Championship could be beneficial for the Italian. Both players were given a handful of opportunities under new manager Mauricio Pochettino during pre-season but the Blues' bloated squad means there is significant competition for minutes and so the decisions have been taken to look for loan moves. Chelsea will also decide on the futures of fellow young midfielders Andrey Santos and Carney Chukwuemeka, both of whom saw plenty of minutes in pre-season."
Where Josko Gvardiol ranks among most expensive defender transfers ever,"Aug 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/where-josko-gvardiol-ranks-most-expensive-defender-transfers-ever,"""What a beautiful surname he has,"" Manchester City's manager grinned before confirming that the Croatian centre-back was undergoing a medical for the European and Premier League champions. Rather than an homage to the Catalan coach, Gvardiol's last name is actually derived from the Latin verb 'guardare', which fittingly translates as 'to guard'. Gvardiol may only be 21 years of age but he has emerged as one of the most highly rated defenders in the world - a lofty billing that is reflected by the hefty fee City belatedly agreed with RB Leipzig this summer. Here's how Gvardiol's transfer to Manchester City compares to the most expensive players to ever guard their own team's goal. Suits you, Josko! ð¤©ð©µ pic.twitter.com/ySy5CfUAQ9 Manchester City's Premier League rivals Chelsea were initially the front runners, failing with an approach for Gvardiol last summer before reigniting their interest in January. Real Madrid entered the race for the Golden Boy nominee, placing Gvardiol top of their centre-back targets in April as reported by 90min. However, Los Blancos have prioritised other areas of the pitch, notably midfield, while Chelsea opted to promote from within by handing the left-footed centre-back Levi Colwill a new six-year deal this summer. City's intent has not shifted even if their patience has been tested. The reigning Premier League champions are no strangers to walking away from a deal which does not match their valuation - as they have previously demonstrated with Harry Maguire, Marc Cucurella and even Declan Rice this summer. At one point in July, RB Leipzig sporting director Max Eberl threatened to step back from negotiations as the clubs remained ""very far apart"". Talks between both parties were gummed up by the proposed fee. RB Leipzig were intent on making Gvardiol the most expensive defender in history, eclipsing the Â£80m which Manchester United spent on Maguire in 2019. Finally, after months of painstaking negotiations, City appear to have won the battle of wills. Three days before Gvardiol was officially unveiled, 90min revealed that Leipzig had settled for an initial fee of Â£77.5m (â¬90m). The final sum for Gvardiol may have just been shy of Maguire's record, but where does he rank on the list of the game's most expensive defenders ever? feed Player Year signed Selling club Buying club Fee Harry Maguire 2019 Leicester Man Utd Â£80m Josko Gvardiol 2023 RB Leipzig Man City Â£77.5m Virgil van Dijk 2018 Southampton Liverpool Â£75m Wesley Fofana 2022 Leicester Chelsea Â£75m Lucas Hernandez 2019 Atletico Madrid Bayern Munich Â£68m Matthijs de Ligt 2019 Ajax Juventus Â£68m Ruben Dias 2020 Benfica Man City Â£62m Achraf Hakimi 2021 Inter PSG Â£59m Matthijs de Ligt 2022 Juventus Bayern Munich Â£59m Marc Cucurella 2022 Brighton Chelsea Â£55m Gvardiol slots into second place on the all-time list of costly defenders, sandwiched between the hulking figures of Maguire and Virgil van Dijk. Liverpool briefly made Van Dijk the most expensive centre-back ever in January 2018, coughing up Â£75m to Southampton. During the previous summer, Van Dijk was accused of going on strike to force through a move by his last Southampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino. The Saints stuck to their guns and kept the unhappy defender on their books for another six months, driving up the price from an initial Â£60m. Unsurprisingly, given the financial clout that the Premier League wields, the four most expensive defenders of all time have been signed by English clubs. Wesley Fofana moved to Chelsea in the summer of 2022 for the same fee as Van Dijk but has come nowhere near the performances produced by the 2019 UEFA Men's Player of the Year. Injury has routinely derailed Fofana's integration in west London. After sitting out 20 games during his debut campaign, the luckless Frenchman ruptured his cruciate ligament in July.  Matthijs de Ligt has been repeatedly linked with a move to the Premier League but is yet to permanently journey across the Channel. The towering Dutch centre-back is the only defender that has ever commanded two separate transfer fees in excess of Â£50m. At just 21, Gvardiol has plenty of time to make another expensive move but he has to guard the goal for Guardiola's team first."
Micky van de Ven set for Tottenham medical ,"Aug 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/micky-van-de-ven-tottenham-medical,"New manager Ange Postecoglou has publicly called for a new defender to be signed this summer and Spurs have responded with a deal for Van de Ven, which could be worth up to â¬50m (Â£43.5m) including add-ons. With the two teams now simply finalising the last details of a transfer, Van de Ven is heading to England to undergo a medical ahead of signing a long-term contract at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The 22-year-old is set to become Spurs' fourth senior signing of the summer, following James Maddison, Guglielmo Vicario and Manor Solomon in joining the club. feed Despite the imminent deal for Van de Ven, 90min understands Spurs remain interested in Barcelona centre-back Clement Lenglet, who spent last season on loan at the club and has interest from across the globe. Al Nassr have made Lenglet an offer but the Frenchman would rather stay in Europe, where Napoli are also plotting a bid. Spurs also have plenty of potential outgoings to deal with. Atletico Madrid are interested in signing Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg while Davinson Sanchez and Tanguy Ndombele are both targets for Galatasaray. Harry Kane is the subject of a â¬100m (Â£88.5m) bid from Bayern Munich, with Spurs battling to try and convince the striker to sign a new contract. Meanwhile, Spurs have finalised the signing of 18-year-old defender Ashley Phillips from Blackburn Rovers, with the teenager expected to head out on loan."
Man City confirm signing of Josko Gvardiol from RB Leipzig,"Aug 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-city-confirm-signing-josko-gvardiol-rb-leipzig,"90min understands that City have agreed to pay an initial Â£77.5m to land Gvardiol, who Pep Guardiola confirmed was in Manchester over the weekend to undergo a medical. A five-year contract has been signed by Gvardiol, who becomes City's second arrival of the summer after fellow Croatian Mateo Kovacic's move from Chelsea. ""I have always dreamed of one day playing in England and to be doing so now with Manchester City â after the season they have just had â is a real honour for me,"" Gvardiol said. ""Anyone who saw Manchester City play last season knows they are the best team in the world. To win the Treble says everything you need to know about the quality this team has. ""To be joining City is something very special for me and my family. To have the chance to work with Pep Guardiola, too, will be amazing. I know I am not yet the finished article and I am sure my game will progress under the best coach in football. ""To be linking up with Mateo Kovacic will also be special. Heâs a top footballer and I hope we can both help City achieve another successful season in 2023/24 and then beyond."" feed Director of football Txiki Begiristain added: ""We are very happy to bring Josko to Manchester City. He is a player we have watched closely, and we feel he has a superb set of attributes. ""Top clubs all over Europe have been monitoring him, so to bring him here is great news for us. ""Josko has so many qualities â everything you want in a centre-half. He is fast, competitive, combative, strong in the air, impressive in possession of the ball, with strong self-belief and a good character. He is left-footed, too, which offers us good options at the back. ""He is still young but his progress in the game has been rapid. We feel confident his upward trajectory will continue here at City working with Pep and his staff."""
Chelsea confirm signing of Robert Sanchez from Brighton,"Aug 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-confirm-signing-robert-sanchez-brighton,"After searching for a new goalkeeper to compete with Kepa Arrizabalaga, the Blues settled on Sanchez and quickly agreed a fee for the 25-year-old which 90min understands sits around the Â£20m mark. Having passed his medical, Sanchez has put pen to paper on a seven-year contract to become Chelsea's seventh signing of the summer. ""Weâre very pleased to welcome Robert to Chelsea and he adds further quality to our goalkeeping unit,"" said sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley, the latter of whom also joined from Brighton last summer. ""Robert has repeatedly proved himself in the Premier League and been capped by his country. We are excited to watch him work with Mauricio and his coaching team during the season ahead."" feed Sanchez worked closely with Chelsea goalkeeping chief Ben Roberts, who was a coach under Graham Potter at both Brighton and Chelsea before being promoted to a more senior role at Stamford Bridge this summer. Chelsea's current lead goalkeeping coach is Toni Jimenez, who joined as part of Mauricio Pochettino's backroom staff. Sanchez leaves Brighton with 87 Premier League appearances to his name and it is that experience in England which has helped endear him to Chelsea's recruitment team, who wanted an experience name to compete with Arrizabalaga. Thanks to his time in the Brighton academy, Sanchez also counts as a homegrown player in the Premier League, which comes as a boost to a Chelsea squad which has already bid farewell to Mason Mount and Ruben Loftus-Cheek this summer."
West Ham agree Â£26m deal to sell Gianluca Scamacca,"Aug 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-agree-26m-deal-sell-gianluca-scamacca,"The 24-year-old was one of the Hammers' marquee signings last summer, alongside Lucas Paqueta, but it was quickly apparent that a change in playing style would be needed to get the best out of the Italian. Injury complaints didn't help Scamacca in trying to settle in London, and he was unable to command a regular starting spot despite costing David Moyes and West Ham in excess of Â£30m when joining from Sassuolo. Scamacca scored eight goals in all competitions from 27 appearances, but crucially netted just three times in the Premier League for West Ham, who laboured to 20 defeats from their 38 league games but did end their 43-year trophy drought by winning the Conference League. 90min revealed in early June that Roma had shown an interest in taking Scamacca back to Serie A, with the player showing a desire to return to his homeland. Jose Mourinho's side were unable to fund a permanent deal, however, and were instead looking to conclude a loan with option or obligation to buy. Inter also made a bid for Scamacca but sources have confirmed to 90min it's Atalanta who have agreed a deal with West Ham. feed Last season's Europa League quarter-finalists will pay a guaranteed â¬25m (Â£21.6m) for Scamacca, with a further â¬5m in achievable add-ons included into the deal, and are set to partner him up with AC Milan's Charles De Ketelaere, who is nearing a loan move with option to buy. 90min understands that Scamacca is already en route to complete a medical, ending his stay in east London after just a year of the five he committed to little over 12 months ago. Scamacca's exit is another blow to a West Ham side who are yet to make a senior signing this summer - they are the only Premier League club who haven't - amid disagreements between Moyes and new technical director Tim Steidten over how to replace Declan Rice, who joined Arsenal earlier this summer in a British-record Â£105m deal. West Ham are also yet to appoint a new club captain, even though the new Premier League season gets underway in six days when newly-promoted Burnley take on Manchester City."

The most expensive Premier League transfer windows ever,"Aug 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/most-expensive-premier-league-transfer-windows-ever,"The spending power of the biggest clubs in England's top flight is almost unrivalled in Europe with even mid-to-lower table sides now on a par with many top teams in Italy, Germany and Spain. For that reason, the general trend of spending figures in Premier League transfer windows is only going up, even if it's not quite as simple as the final figure being higher year on year. Here are the six highest-spending Premier League transfer windows ever. That such a recent year is down in sixth place is due to the real effects of the Covid-19 pandemic that began to be felt by football clubs. Less so at Premier League level, of course, but it still existed.Major moves in this summer transfer window included Romelu Lukaku's return to Chelsea from Inter for Â£103.5m, Jack Grealish's switch from Aston Villa to Manchester City for Â£100m and Jadon Sancho's Â£76.5m arrival at Manchester United from Borussia Dortmund. A big summer for a number of teams, Liverpool spent big to bring in Alisson for Â£66.8m and Naby Keita for Â£48m, as well as Fabinho for Â£39m. Man City splashed out on Riyad Mahrez for Â£60m from Leicester, while Chelsea paid Â£71.6m for Kepa Arrizabalaga.Fred arrived at Man Utd for Â£47m and there were also plenty of mid-level deals done by some of the smaller sides in the league, such as Richarlison's Â£25m move to Everton. You may expect this transfer window to have been more depressed due to the Covid-19 pandemic but there was little knowledge at this stage about just how disrupted life was going to be over the next couple of years.For that reason, Premier League spending was around the sort of level that had become the norm in the few years prior. Chelsea spent Â£222.5m in this window on players like Kai Havertz, Timo Werner and Ben Chilwell. Man City signed Ruben Dias for Â£61m, while Liverpool forked out Â£40m on Diogo Jota. This was a record-breaking year at the time and really made a lot of people sit up and realise just how much the Premier League was now able to spend.Mohamed Salah arrived at Liverpool, though only for a modest fee of Â£34m, while Man Utd spent Â£146m on Romelu Lukaku, Nemanja Matic and Victor Lindelof. Man City parted with Â£211m on various players that included Ederson, Danilo, Kyle Walker and Bernardo Silva. This is a transfer window that will sting in hindsight for a lot of clubs, as any wasted money was compounded by the forecoming pandemic. That is the case for Arsenal, who wasted Â£72m on Nicolas Pepe in 2019.Man City splashed the cash yet again as they spent almost Â£130m on Rodri and Joao Cancelo during this window, while Man Utd parted with around the same amount on Harry Maguire and Aaron Wan-Bissaka to bolster their defence.Even Newcastle were spending - back under Mike Ashley when it was a surprise - as they dropped Â£40m on Joelinton. Another regretful signing, Tottenham spent Â£53.8m on Tanguy Ndombele from Lyon. The big one. There are varying ways to judge the overall spend of a transfer window and by some estimates, 2022 was a Â£2bn window. We have used Deloitte for all of the figures and they say it fell just short.While it was January 2023 when Todd Boehly really came into his own, Chelsea still used Â£254m on a number of players. Darwin Nunez arrived at Liverpool for Â£67.5m, Erling Haaland docked at City for Â£51m, and Man Utd signed Antony, Casemiro, Lisandro Martinez and Tyrell Malacia for Â£214m.What really showed how things have changed was the amount unestablished Premier League teams like Leeds (Â£93m) and Brentford (Â£45m) could spend.It remains to be seen whether 2023 is going to immediately break the record once again, but even if it doesn't, it certainly won't take long."

Why would Tottenham want to sign Alejo Veliz?,"Aug 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/why-would-tottenham-want-sign-alejo-veliz,"The 16-year-old had just begun pre-season with Central Rosario's youth team when COVID-19 hit. ""I couldn't go back and I started to think about studying something because it took too long,"" Veliz remembered. ""Thank God I stayed."" Veliz made his debut for the senior side 18 months after the pandemic's outbreak and has been a fixture of the first team since 2022. This summer, the teenager has attracted increasing interest from the Premier League's Tottenham Hotspur. Aside from an iron will, here's why Spurs are leading the race for a player who almost gave up the game entirely three years ago. ð¥ðºð¦  Alejo VÃ©liz, 1 a 0 y explota el Gigante pic.twitter.com/mIBkaAWChy Veliz made his debut for Central in July 2021. Within 12 months, he had entered club folklore. Half-time was rapidly approaching in the fiercely contested Rosarian derby against Newell's Old Boys when Jhonatan Candia swung a free kick into the box. Veliz, who stands at 6'1, out-jumped his marker to loop Central into a lead. The only goal of the game sparked an ear-splitting roar in the Gigante de Arroyito. Veliz has many years of football ahead of him but will have to go some way to top a decisive contribution against your first club's biggest rivals. The winner against Newell's was only the third goal of Veliz's senior career but it would prove to be a prescient participation. Six of Veliz's 19 goals for Central exploded off his forehead and all three of his strikes during this year's under-20 World Cup were headers. Harry Kane broke the Premier League record for headed goals in a single season last term, notching ten. Tottenham's talisman took advantage of the team's myriad of set-piece ploys sketched up by the specialist coach Gianni Vio. The Italian may have parted ways with the club this summer but new manager Ange Postecoglou developed a range of routines during his time at Celtic. While Veliz would offer another aerial target other than Kane it would be an almighty task for the youngster to replace the England captain entirely if a move to Bayern Munich does materialise. Veliz may be one of the Argentine top flight's most exciting young strikers but he is best described as promising rather than prolific and still has plenty of rough edges to smooth - notably, his ability (or willingness) to create for others. If the teenager does move to Tottenham, it will surely be in an understudy role to the first choice option - whether that be Kane or the misfiring Richarlison. What Veliz does bring in abundance is grit. During Carlos Tevez's brief five months as Central coach, Veliz said that he ""took every piece of advice he gave me"". That tenacity embodied by the former Manchester United and Manchester City striker is evident in Veliz on and off the pitch. In April of this year, the day after scoring in a 2-2 draw against Boca Juniors, Veliz was driving to training when he was T-boned by a truck which fled the scene. He started Central's next match the following week. Just four days after playing in Argentina's last-16 exit from this summer's under-20 World Cup, Veliz not only appeared for Central but scored in a 4-1 win over Instituto. Team Appearances Goals Assists Rosario Central 62 19 2 Argentina Under-20s 9 3 0 feed An impressive tally of 11 goals in 23 top-flight games for Central this year - the highest tally of any teenager in the division - has attracted interest from across Europe. The bulk of bids swamping Rosario Central's transfer department stemmed from Serie A. AC Milan, Roma, Salernitana and Torino all expressed interest in the 19-year-old, who set tongues wagging at a greater velocity with his forceful displays in this year's under-20 World Cup. Tottenham's Premier League rivals Nottingham Forest also flirted with Veliz but 90min understands that the striker is prioritising a move to north London after Spurs agreed to meet his Â£13m release clause. However, when Veliz will line up for the Lilywhites remains to be seen. Spurs are expected to hand Veliz a long-term deal but may be prepared to loan the striker back to Central in the immediate future. The Rosario club are certainly trying to keep hold of their talented forward - who would join the likes of Angel Di Maria and his potential Tottenham teammate Giovani Lo Celso in big-money moves away from Central. Talk of a loan until January, if not longer, has been floated. Just three short years ago, Veliz didn't look like making a professional appearance for any club, let alone one in the world's biggest league."
Bayern Munich submit club-record offer for Harry Kane,"Aug 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-submit-club-record-offer-harry-kane,"England captain Kane has been Bayern's top transfer target all summer and the two clubs recently met for talks in London. The Bundesliga giants left with optimism that a deal this summer could be struck. Bayern previously had two offers rejected, the second of which amounted to â¬80m (Â£68.5m), and 90min can confirm their third offer totals â¬100m (Â£86m). Spurs have been hesitant to sell but there has been pressure on chairman Daniel Levy within the club's hierarchy to consider selling Kane to avoid losing him for free next summer. Thomas Tuchel's side are unlikely to return with a higher bid if Tottenham are left unsatisfied with the third offer. Bayern do, however, want a decision over the sale to be made quickly by Spurs. Tottenham have been confident throughout the summer of keeping the 30-year-old even though his deal expires next year. The north London side remain hopeful Kane will sign a new contract and plan to work on fresh terms during Ange Postecoglou's first season in charge. feed Spurs informed Kane at the start of the transfer window they had no plans to sell him, with Manchester United, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain among the European heavyweights eyeing a move. The start of the new Premier League season is only a week away and Spurs have brought in James Maddison, Guglielmo Vicario and Manor Solomon, also making the loans for Dejan Kulusevski and Pedro Porro permanent. Progress has been made in the pursuit of centre-back Micky van de Ven, while Spurs have also agreed to meet the release clause of Rosario Central striker Alejo Veliz."
Pep Guardiola issues warnings to Barcelona & Bayern Munich over Bernardo Silva & Kyle Walker,"Aug 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/pep-guardiola-issues-warnings-barcelona-bayern-munich-bernardo-silva-kyle-walker,"The two City stars have been approached over summer exits but Guardiola does not want to weaken his squad any further, having already lost both Ilkay Gundogan and Riyad Mahrez during this transfer window. While Guardiola has long insisted he will not block any unhappy player from leaving, he warned both Barca and Bayern that City will not simply hand their players away for cheap. ""I don't want any players who don't want to be here but I'm an employee. I want to work with guys who want to stay and work with staff and players, but after we have to get a proper offer,"" Guardiola explained. ""If we don't get a proper offer, he's our player and we want him. If they want him, they will take a plane and come here and talk to our sporting director and CEO to make an agreement because three parts have to be there. ""For us to buy a player, just because we are Man City it is Â£10-15m more expensive than other clubs all the time. If people want our really really important players, first they have to make an offer - and that hasn't happened. When it happens, we will fight to extend the contract and be with us. That has happened with all of our players since day one."" feed Guardiola went on to stress that the challenge of replacing two undisputed starters on a treble-winning side would be a costly operation and so those players will only be sold for substantial offers. ""When you win the Treble, it looks like the job is done. Players who are 32, 33 like Ilkay and Riyad say we arrived here for Premier Leagues and then people ask about the Champions League,"" he continued. ""Some players feel they want a new experience. I will not be the guy who says no - but they have to make an agreement with the important part of the club, the business. Make a deal and it happens. ""In the case of Bernardo and Kyle, we talk many times over the last months and even years how important they are, how we want them and we will continue to do so until the end. I don't know what will happen but it won't happen if the clubs don't arrive because they are massively important players. ""When we lose those players we have to go to the market for the replacements and these players and they cost more than Â£50m. We need that money to reimburse on other players to make the team as strong as possible to defend the crowns that we won and win games for our people."""
Pep Guardiola confirms Josko Gvardiol's Man City medical,"Aug 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/pep-guardiola-confirms-josko-gvardiol-man-city-medical,"City have struck a deal worth an initial Â£77.5m to sign Gvardiol, with add-ons which could see the transfer become the most expensive ever to involve a centre-back. Guardiola has now confirmed that Gvardiol, who's childhood nickname was Guardiola due to the obvious similarities between the two names, is in Manchester to put the finishing touches on his move. ""Gvardiol, what a beautiful surname he has!"" Guardiola joked during a press conference. ""He is doing a medical test. Everybody knows he is here. Hopefully, we can finish the deal in the next few hours or days."" feed Should all go according to plan, Gvardiol would become the sixth centre-back in the City squad alongside Ruben Dias, John Stones, Manuel Akanji, Nathan Ake, Aymeric Laporte, while Kyle Walker often inverts from right-back as well. ""The season is so long. [Six] is not too much],"" Guardiola said of his defensive group. Walker is facing an uncertain future at City as Bayern Munich try to lure the England international away, but Guardiola is prepared for a fight to keep him. He said: ""[Walker] is so important to us. We want [him] and will do everything. We want him to stay because he wants to stay. We will do everything."""
Arsenal submit opening bid for Brentford's David Raya,"Aug 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-submit-opening-bid-brentford-david-raya,"Brentford have made it clear all summer that they are prepared to sell Raya, who is in the final year of his contract, for Â£40m - an asking price which scared off Tottenham before they signed Guglielmo Vicario instead. After expressing an interest in Raya earlier this week, Arsenal have now opened the bidding with an offer which 90min understands is closer to half of Brentford's asking price. An initial Â£20m has been proposed, with Arsenal also prepared to pay up to Â£5m in potential add-ons. Brentford are expected to reject the offer as they stand firm on their asking price. Manager Thomas Frank recently insisted Â£40m is cheap for Raya, pointing to Arsenal's decision to sign another player in the final year of their contract, Declan Rice, for Â£105m. feed Arsenal are not alone in their pursuit of Raya, with German giants Bayern Munich also keen on the Spaniard as they seek to replace Yann Sommer, who is expected to join Inter. Sommer has acted as cover for the injured Manuel Neuer after the German broke his leg following the conclusion of the World Cup but is expected to leave this summer and Bayern are keen to move for Raya, although Brentford's asking price continues to prove problematic. Raya himself confessed earlier this summer that he feared Brentford's Â£40m demand would price him out of a transfer, although the 27-year-old vowed to respect his club's decision and remain focused on the job if he is not granted an exit. As for Brentford, they have already signed a replacement for Raya, striking a deal to recruit Dutch international Mark Flekken from Freiburg last month."
Chelsea confirm signing of centre-back Axel Disasi from Monaco,"Aug 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-confirm-signing-centre-back-axel-disasi-monaco,"A Â£38m deal was agreed with Monaco earlier this week to bring Disasi, who was playing alongside current Blues defender Benoit Badiashile last season, over to Stamford Bridge. The deal is now complete, with 25-year-old Disasi signing a six-year contract to commit himself to Chelsea until 2029. ""Axel has showcased his quality over several seasons in France and that has deservedly led to recognition on the international stage,"" said sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart, the latter of whom joined from Monaco in February. ""He is ready to take the next step in his career and we are delighted that will be with Chelsea. We welcome him to the club and look forward to him joining up with Mauricio Pochettino and his new teammates in the days ahead."" feed Disasi becomes Chelsea's sixth signing of the summer, following Christopher Nkunku, Nicolas Jackson, Lesley Ugochukwu, Angelo and Diego Moreira in putting pen to paper on contracts at Stamford Bridge. A move for Disasi was accelerated after it was revealed that fellow defender Wesley Fofana had undergone surgery on an ACL injury which will keep him out for the majority of the coming campaign. Chelsea are well-stocked at centre-back, where Disasi's former Monaco teammate Badiashile joins Thiago Silva, Levi Colwill and Trevoh Chalobah as available options for the coming campaign. Pochettino enjoyed an unbeaten pre-season and will return to Premier League action when Liverpool make the trip to London on 13 August."
When Man Utd hope to unveil Rasmus Hojlund,"Aug 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/when-man-utd-hope-unveil-rasmus-hojlund,"United have agreed a deal which could be worth up to Â£72m to sign 20-year-old Hojlund, who has already passed his medical in Manchester and is understood to have signed his contract - a five-year deal with the option for a sixth. Plans to announce Hojlund's signing earlier this week were derailed as the striker's trip to Manchester was delayed and so United have been forced to reschedule their unveiling. Sources have confirmed to 90min that United are looking to publicise their signing of Hojlund around the time of Saturday's pre-season friendly against Lens at Old Trafford. The game kicks off at 12:45, with Hojlund expected to be in attendance. feed It will be the first time United have played at Old Trafford this summer and so home fans will also get their first glimpses of fellow new signings Mason Mount and Andre Onana, who joined earlier this summer from Chelsea and Inter respectively. Results have been mixed for Erik ten Hag's side this summer. After kicking off pre-season with victories over Leeds, Lyon and Arsenal, United have lost three on the bounce against Wrexham, Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund. Ten Hag labelled United's performance against Dortmund ""unforgivable"" and will demand more from his side in front of their home fans against Lens. United are also due in Dublin's Aviva Stadium on Sunday for one final friendly against Athletic Club."

Brighton inform Moises Caicedo of transfer decision amid ongoing Chelsea interest,"Aug 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/brighton-inform-moises-caicedo-transfer-decision-chelsea-interest,"The Ecuador international is continuing to be courted by Chelsea, who have already seen two bids - the first worth Â£70m and the second worth Â£80m - knocked back by the Seagulls. 90min understands that Caicedo has confirmed his desire to leave Brighton on several occasions this summer. The club are keen to avoid him making his agitations public and so have decided to communicate why they are not entertaining Chelsea's most recent offers. Brighton value Caicedo at a similar amount to Declan Rice, who recently signed for Arsenal from West Ham United for a British-record Â£105m transfer fee, and this has been explained to the player and his representatives. Chelsea remain undeterred in their pursuit of Caicedo and will continue their advances. They have already agreed a deal to sign Robert Sanchez from Brighton this window and the clubs are on good terms despite their ongoing grievances over Caicedo and Levi Colwill, who put pen to paper on a new six-year contract at Stamford Bridge this week. feed When quizzed about Caicedo ahead of their pre-season friendly with Chelsea in the United States last month, Brighton head coach Roberto De Zerbi insisted the midfielder is going nowhere anytime soon and poked fun at the Blues' inability to qualify for Europe. ""It's a clear situation at the moment. [Caicedo] stays with us until my owner changes his mind,"" De Zerbi said. ""I don't know what can happen in the future, but if Moises leaves we have to find the right player because it's difficult to replace a player as good as Moises. We have to substitute him with a great player because this year we play in the Europa League unlike Chelsea."""

Ndombele was set to feature on Spurs' pre-season tour of Australia and Asia, but sustained an injury prior to their first friendly and has only just returned to training. feed The Rossoneri had been expected to sign the Japan midfielder from Eintracht Frankfurt but pulled the plug following a shake-up among their transfer decision-makers. Castrovilli will arrive in England to undergo a medical on Friday and seal his move to the Vitality Stadium.

Al Ahli to beat Juventus & Tottenham to signing of Franck Kessie,"Aug 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/al-ahli-to-beat-juventus-tottenham-signing-franck-kessie,"The Ivory Coast international only joined Barca from AC Milan on a free transfer last summer, and despite scoring a memorable last-minute winner against Real Madrid on their way to La Liga title glory, he was scarcely afforded extended chances at Camp Nou. 90min reported on Wednesday that Tottenham Hotspur had held talks with Barcelona over signing Kessie as well as teammate Clement Lenglet, who spent last season on loan in north London. But 90min understands that Spurs are again set to miss out on a long-term target in Kessie as he has agreed to join Saudi outfit Al Ahli. Barcelona had initially assumed that Kessie's preference was to remain in Europe, but they will now sit down to thrash out a â¬15m (Â£13m) with Al Ahli, who have also signed Edouard Mendy, Roberto Firmino, Riyad Mahrez and Allan Saint-Maximin this transfer window. feed Crucially, Barcelona will not have to pay a portion of Kessie's wages in order to get him off their books, allowing them further flexibility under La Liga's strict financial restrictions. In addition to Tottenham, Juventus had also been eyeing Kessie and had made a tentative loan offer to Barcelona. The Bianconeri have since turned their attention back to Arsenal's Thomas Partey, but the Gunners' â¬46.5m (Â£40m) price tag is proving prohibitive at this moment. Juve and other interested clubs could test Arsenal's resolve after the start of the 2023/24 season if he is not a guaranteed starter. With the departures of Kessie and Ousmane Dembele likely to be confirmed in the coming days, Barcelona are set to make a combined â¬65m (Â£56m) in player sales for the duo and are now ramping up efforts to sign Joao Cancelo from Manchester City."
Players Barcelona should sign with Ousmane Dembele fee,"Aug 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/players-barcelona-should-sign-with-ousmane-dembele-fee,"90min understands that he has agreed personal terms over a move back to his homeland and could even be unveiled as a new PSG player by the end of the week. It will bring an end to Dembele's six-year stint in Catalonia - a spell which has been largely underwhelming considering the promise he arrived with and the â¬145m (Â£125m) total fee paid to Borussia Dortmund. PSG will fork over â¬50m (Â£43m) for Dembele. Here are the players Barcelona could, and perhaps should, recruit with that sum. feed Head coach Xavi admitted earlier this week that he is in desperate need of a new natural right-back. ""The right-back is a position that we should look at again, and reinforce,"" he said. ""We have players who adapt but they are not in their natural positions. We will see how everything turns out and how we also fit into financial fair play."" Few modern day full-backs fit the Barcelona mould the way that Joao Cancelo does. 90min reported on Wednesday that Barca are reigniting their interest in the Portugal international having tried but failed to sign him during the January transfer window. Barcelona would prefer to take Cancelo, who has four years left to run on his Manchester City contract, on an initial loan with an option to buy. Classic Barca trying to kick the can down the road. Right, let's move on to actual winger targets and not just any old player that Barcelona are actively talking about. 90min reported last month that Man City were battling PSG and RB Leipzig for Lyon winger Bradley Barcola, seeing him as a potential replacement for Riyad Mahrez. Barcola ended his breakout 2022/23 season with seven goals and ten assists in 35 games for Lyon. If Barcelona want one of Europe's up-and-coming wide threats, then they should consider entering these sweepstakes. Villarreal winger Yeremy Pino is quickly announcing himself as one of Spanish football's top prospects. He has spent three full seasons in the Yellow Submarine's first team and was part of their Europa League-winning contingent of 2021, while he played a starring role in Spain's Nations League triumph in June. Pino's â¬80m (Â£69m) release clause may prove prohibitive to Barcelona unless they shift a few more players, such as Tottenham targets Franck Kessie and Clement Lenglet. This would be a highly ambitious move and one that would stretch Barcelona in a financial sense, but Joao Felix is a player that would love to make the move and would certainly raise the technical levels of La Blaugrana. In fact, Felix recently discussed his desire to play for Barcelona in an interview with Fabrizio Romano, saying: ""I'd love to play for Barca. Barcelona has always been my first choice and I'd love to join Barca. It was always my dream since I was a kid. If it happens, it will be a dream come true for me."" The endless link. Bernardo Silva has continually been tipped to leave Man City and it is usually Barcelona touted as the destination. Barca are still interested, but due to the aforementioned sale of Mahrez, 90min understands that Siva will be staying put at the Etihad Stadium. A versatile Ajax forward who has World Cup experience but has only been linked with a move to the Premier League? This sounds like something Barcelona should be all over. Mohammed Kudus has been the rare shining light for both club and country over the last year, turning on the style in poor Ajax and Ghana teams. 90min understands he is wanted by Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United, who could all probably out-bid Barcelona if push came to shove, unfortunately. Electrifying and fleet-footed, Jeremy Doku would make for a nice project to succeed Dembele. The 21-year-old hasn't quite kicked on since his marvellous performances at Euro 2020 but he has continually been linked with the continent's biggest clubs. Why couldn't it be Barcelona that takes a punt on his potential and upside?"
Newcastle agree deal for Tino Livramento,"Aug 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/newcastle-agree-deal-tino-livramento,"It is understood the deal is worth around Â£35m to Southampton with another Â£5m in add-ons, although a sell-on clause will means at least 40% is due to former club Chelsea. Livramento is now due in the north east for his medical ahead of putting pen to paper on a long-term contract which is already agreed. Newcastle have been wanting to bolster their full-back option this summer and Livramento emerged as their top target. The 20-year-old can play on both sides, whilst current right-back and Kieran Trippier can also switch to the left offering additional options to Eddie Howe. The Livramento deal will represent Newcastle's third major transfer of the summer following on from the captures of AC Milan's Sandro Tonali and Leicester City's Harvey Barnes. Overall, it takes their spending for this transfer window through the Â£100m barrier.  90min understands that a right-sided centre-back and a 'number 10' remain in their sights. Financial Fair Play (FFP) issues are a consideration for Newcastle and are anxious not to breach the regulations. But they are exploring additional options such a possible loan deals with mandatory fees which will allow them to circumnavigate some of those concerns. feed 90min can also confirm Newcastle are also continuing to work hard on finalising a new contract for Brazilian star Bruno Guimaraes. The 25-year-old has been in talks over a new deal and personal terms are not seen as a major issue. However, the talks have stalled and Guimaraes himself recently admitted that he was not sure where the deal was and Howe is pushing for Newcastle to get it done. Howe said: ""There is no doubt in my mind about his future. We would love Bruno to extend his time with us for a long time. I'm not party to those talks every day. Those talks are ongoing and Bruno knows how we feel about him. He's very happy here. We hope there's a solution to be found."""
Ousmane Dembele set to complete PSG move from Barcelona,"Aug 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ousmane-dembele-set-complete-psg-move-barcelona,"90min reported on Monday that Dembele had agreed personal terms over a move back to France, which came as a bit of a shock to the footballing world considering there had been little speculation suggesting he was looking to leave this summer. Barca head coach Xavi and new club captain Sergi Roberto have both spoken of their surprise and disappointment of Dembele's fresh intentions to leave. Sources have now confirmed to 90min that PSG are closing in on the signing of Dembele after paying a â¬50m (Â£43m) release clause in his Barcelona contract. With that money, the Spanish champions will step up their pursuit of Manchester City's Joao Cancelo. Xavi spoke earlier this week of his desperation to bring in a new right-back and the sale of Dembele should allow them further flexibility in the summer transfer market. feed PSG are hoping to finalise Dembele's move by the end of the week, and 90min understands they are also looking to push through a move for Benfica forward Goncalo Ramos in that timeframe as well. Both head coach Luis Enrique and sporting advisor Luis Campos are keen to add Ramos to their ranks. The French champions previously held an interest in Manchester United-bound Rasmus Hojlund. Ramos is expected to arrive for a fee in the region of â¬80m (Â£69m), while PSG retain an interest in his Portugal teammate Joao Felix. The 23-year-old spent the second half of last season on loan at Chelsea but has since returned to Atletico Madrid. PSG's negotiations with Atleti are not currently advanced, though the deal is not completely dead yet."
Tottenham agree to meet Argentina youth international's Â£13m release clause,"Aug 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-agree-argentina-youth-international-13m-release-clause,"Spurs recently opened talks with the Argentine club for 19-year-old Veliz, who had also attracted interest from AC Milan, Roma, Salernitana and Nottingham Forest. The 19-year-old rose to global prominence during the 2023 FIFA Under-20 World Cup as part of Argentina's squad, scoring three times before his side were knocked out in the last 16 by Nigeria. Rival interest had arisen from Serie A and the Premier League but 90min has been told the young striker made Tottenham his preferred destination which has helped with negotiations. A long-term contract is in the works and no issues are expected to flare up between Veliz and Spurs in that department. Veliz scored 11 times in the 2023 Argentine Primera Division, only two fewer than joint-leading scorers Pablo Vegetti and Michael Santos. He made his debut for Central in 2021 during a Copa Sudamericana clash with Deportivo Tachira and has since netted 19 goals in total for the club. feed Discussions are now being held over Veliz's short-term future. Rosario are keen to keep the teenager - who turns 20 in September - until January on loan and possibly beyond. Tottenham have long needed back-up options for Harry Kane, whose own future in north London is under extreme scrutiny with Bayern Munich confident of completing a deal for the England captain. Richarlison suffered an injury-hit first campaign with Spurs but would be the obvious replacement up front if Kane does leave before the season starts. A central defender is still being targeted with talks advancing for Wolfsburg's Micky van de Ven as new head coach Ange Postecoglou looks to fix a defence that conceded 63 Premier League goals last season. Out of favour Barcelona duo Franck Kessie and Clement Lenglet - the latter of whom spent last season in north London - remain targets, while Denmark international Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg could be shipped off to Atletico Madrid."
Arsenal hold talks with Burnley over Albert Sambi Lokonga exit,"Aug 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-talks-burnley-albert-sambi-lokonga-exit,"Lokonga joined from Anderlecht in the summer of 2021 for a fee of around for around Â£18m but has struggled to find his place at the Emirates and ended last season out on loan with Crystal Palace. Now back with Arsenal, the 23-year-old picked up an injury which prevented him from travelling with the squad for their pre-season campaign, only adding to the frustration surrounding his time in north London. Arsenal are open to parting ways with Lokonga and sources have confirmed to 90min that Burnley have explored a move for the midfielder. The newly promoted side are looking to land Lokonga's signature on a season-long loan deal which would include an obligation for a permanent transfer next summer. feed Lokonga has managed 39 appearances for Arsenal but has seen competition for midfield minutes ramped up by the expensive signings of both Declan Rice and Kai Havertz for a combined Â£170m this summer. Thomas Partey has also been welcomed back into Arsenal's squad after initially being given permission to explore interest from Saudi Arabia, while the Gunners remain interested in signing 23-year-old Brazilian Bitello from Gremio. As a result, Lokonga is one of a handful of first-team players over whom tough decisions will need to be made in the coming weeks. Striker Folarin Balogun could be sold after a Â£50m price tag was placed on the United States international's head, while the likes of Nuno Tavares and Nicolas Pepe are expected to depart."
Chelsea agree fee with Brighton over Robert Sanchez,"Aug 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-agree-fee-brighton-robert-sanchez,"The Blues sold Edouard Mendy to Al Ahli earlier this summer and have been on the hunt for more experienced competition for Kepa Arrizabalaga, and club officials have now settled on a move for Sanchez. Sanchez, 25, lost his place as Brighton's starting goalkeeper midway through last season as Roberto De Zerbi preferred the ball-playing abilities of Jason Steele, while the Seagulls have also brought in Bart Verbruggen from Anderlecht for just over Â£16m this summer. Sources have now confirmed to 90min that Sanchez is closing in on a move to Chelsea. A fee has been agreed between the two clubs, and with personal terms not an issue, Sanchez is now expected to undergo a medical imminently ahead of putting pen to paper on a contract at Stamford Bridge. Much of the club's push for Sanchez has come from goalkeeping chief Ben Roberts, who worked with the Spaniard as a coach at Brighton before following Graham Potter to Chelsea, where he was eventually promoted to a role which sees him involved in goalkeeper recruitment. feed Chelsea have been looking for a high-level goalkeeper to provide competition for Kepa and began the summer exploring a deal for Andre Onana, only to allow the Cameroon international to move to Manchester United instead. A bid for AC Milan's Mike Maignan was also ruled out due to the Italian side's high asking price. Sanchez's Premier League experience, coupled with the fact he counts towards Chelsea's homegrown quota thanks to his time in the Brighton academy, has helped endear him to the club's recruitment department. Talks remain on between Chelsea and Brighton over midfielder Moises Caicedo, for whom the Blues have seen multiple bids rejected already this summer. An Â£80m offer was swiftly rejected by Brighton, who are holding out for Â£100m to part ways with their star midfielder."

Tottenham advance negotiations with Wolfsburg for Micky van de Ven,"Aug 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-advance-negotiations-wolfsburg-micky-van-de-ven,"Spurs have been on the hunt for reinforcements at centre-back following a Premier League campaign which saw them concede a staggering 63 goals - the third worst record among teams that were not relegated to the Championship. New head coach Ange Postecoglou has made public his desire to bring in new defenders this transfer window, with 90min previously reporting that Van de Ven and Bayer Leverkusen's Edmond Tapsoba were their top targets. Bayer Leverkusen's demands of a fee in excess of Â£43m for Tapsoba may have proven too much for Tottenham however, as 90min understands they are now advancing with a Â£35m deal to bring in Van de Ven from fellow Bundesliga side Wolfsburg. feed The 21-year-old has played 41 times for Wolfsburg since his 2021 move from Dutch second division side Volendam, announcing himself as one of Europe's top young defenders. After a delay in finalising the deal, Spurs are also expected to complete the signing of highly-rated 18-year-old Ashley Phillips from Blackburn Rovers this week. Meanwhile, 90min reported earlier on Wednesday that Tottenham had held talks with Barcelona regarding the potential re-signing of former loanee Clement Lenglet if deals for either Tapsoba or Van de Ven fell through. Barca are determined to move on from the France international this window."
Man Utd confirm goalkeeper departure,"Aug 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-confirm-goalkeeper-departure,"Bishop was 20 years of age when he joined United from Southend United in January 2020, having already played 31 times in League One over several seasons with the Shrimpers. The goalkeeper linked up with Unitedâs Under-23 squad, before then playing a full season on loan at Mansfield in League Two in 2021/22. He leaves without making a competitive first-team appearance. The 23-year-old now joins a Sunderland side targeting a return to the Premier League after reaching the Championship playoffs last season. The likelihood is he will provide competition and cover for established Black Cats number one Anthony Patterson. ""You see the direction that the club is going, playing young players and allowing them to express themselves and push on in a great league,"" Bishop said of Sunderland. ""I think that is so exciting, so I want to come in and earn the right to play for such a great team and a great club."" feed Bishop most recently hit the headlines during Unitedâs pre-season tour, featuring in the friendly against Wrexham in San Diego. He was involved in an unfortunate collision with Paul Mullin that left the Wrexham striker with a punctured lung. There was backlash from opposing fans, while Wrexham manager Phil Parkinson also slated Bishop for his involvement in the incident. But the goalkeeper apologised to Mullin and was also personally contacted by Wrexham co-owner Ryan Reynolds to thank him for how he handled things. Manchester United are left with Andre Onana, Tom Heaton and Dean Henderson are their first-team goalkeepers, although the latterâs future remains uncertain. Czech pair Matej Kovar and Radek Vitek have also played a part with the senior squad during pre-season."
Tottenham continue talks with Atletico Madrid over Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg sale,"Aug 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-continue-talks-atletico-madrid-pierre-emile-hojbjerg,"The Denmark international is heading into his fourth season at Spurs but could yet find himself at a different team before the end of the summer transfer window. 90min were first to report back in June that Tottenham would consider offers for Hojbjerg, and Atletico Madrid are in talks over a deal. Los Rojiblancos are looking to add another combative midfielder to their ranks. They have earmarked Hojbjerg and Fiorentina's Sofyan Amrabat as options, though 90min understands that the latter is the subject of intense interest from Manchester United and they will ramp up efforts to sign him once they clear their wage bill. Atletico Madrid are therefore expected to pivot to Hojbjerg as their top target, though are reluctant to pay more than Â£30m for his services. feed Spurs began the summer window with a Â£40m valuation of the midfielder, who turns 28 later this week. However, with few other suitors stepping forward, they could lower this asking price and their stance that they will not stand in the way of an exit remains. When asked specifically about the club's interest in Hojbjerg, Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone said: ""There are names the club is working on to address the situation of necessity and obligation. The club will decide, we need a new midfielder."" During Tottenham's two pre-season friendlies under new head coach Ange Postecoglou thus far, Hojbjerg has been used with the squad's second unit, with Yves Bissouma preferred as a holding midfielder and Oliver Skipp, James Maddison and Pape Sarr starting ahead of him in a more advanced role. Hojbjerg joined Tottenham from Southampton during the summer of 2020 for an initial Â£15m fee. He has played 145 games in his three seasons at the club."
Man City finalise agreement with RB Leipzig for Josko Gvardiol,"Aug 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-city-world-record-agreement-rb-leipzig-josko-gvardiol,"The two clubs have been locked in talks for weeks with only finer details needed to be agreed upon, and it is now understood that an agreement has been reached that will see City pay an initial Â£77.5m (â¬90m). The deal, which also includes an agreement that City will play a friendly in Leipzig in the future, will not beat the previous record set by Manchester United when they paid Â£80m (â¬92m) to Leicester City for Harry Maguire in 2019. Gvardiol has already agreed personal terms with City, having been waiting on the deal for much of the summer, and is now due to undergo a medical in England before the weekend. City hope that the deal will be completed ahead of this weekend's FA Community Shield clash with Arsenal at Wembley. feed 21-year-old Gvardiol is set to become City's second signing of the summer following countryman Mateo Kovacic into the Etihad Stadium. The former Chelsea man has already sang the praises of his future club-mate. ""Josko has great potential, he can come here and learn and be the best version of himself. I'd obviously like it - I'm a good friend with him and heâs Croatian. It would be nice to have a Croatian by my side here,"" Kovacic said earlier this month. ""I think it's a good time [to join City]. They are on a great run, a very confident team and a team you can learn from. They have possibly the best manager in history. So I came here to join a great group and to try to learn. ""He's still young but heâs mature. He doesn't need much advice. He had a great World Cup and a great season with Leipzig."""
Man Utd receive loan offer for Donny van de Beek,"Aug 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-receive-loan-offer-donny-van-de-beek,"The Netherlands international has played 60 times for the Red Devils since joining from Ajax in 2020, though most of these appearances have come as a substitute and his last two seasons have been plagued by injuries. The arrival of Mason Mount from Chelsea has pushed Van de Beek further down the Old Trafford pecking order and Man Utd are open to a departure during the summer transfer window, with 90min reporting during July that he was considering his options. 90min understands that Spanish side Real Sociedad, who have qualified for the 2023/24 Champions League, have stepped forward and offered to take Van de Beek on loan with an optional purchase clause. feed Man Utd are aware of La Real's concerns over the knee injury which prematurely ended his 2022/23 season and so are willing to sanction a loan, with the two clubs in talks over the sum of the option to buy. Van de Beek is keen on a move to San Sebastian. Sources have told 90min that Man Utd are looking to free up space on their wage bill with the departures of Van de Beek and fellow midfielder Fred in order to push ahead with a move for Fiorentina's Sofyan Amrabat. 90min reported last month that Man Utd have held talks with the Italian side over a transfer, but face competition from Atletico Madrid. While their search for a new midfielder rumbles on, Man Utd will soon announce the signing of striker Rasmus Hojlund from Atalanta following his medical.

Xavi admits Ousmane Dembele disappointment ahead of Barcelona exit,"Aug 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/xavi-admits-ousmane-dembele-disappointment-barcelona-exit,"France international Dembele became one of the most expensive players ever when Barca paid Borussia Dortmund an initial Â£97m in 2017, with add-ons potentially taking the deal up to Â£135.5m. Dembele suffered consistent injury issues in his first few years at Camp Nou but returned to form last term, contributing five goals and seven assists in 25 La Liga games. However, his six-season stay in Catalonia is expected to end soon. 90min reported earlier this week Dembele has agreed personal terms to join PSG on a five-year deal, with the Ligue 1 holders also in talks with Barca over a fee to sign the France international.  Following Barcelona's 1-0 pre-season win over AC Milan, Xavi confirmed to Relevo Dembele's desire to leave and admitted he is not happy with how the situation has played out. The former Spain midfielder said: ""I will be very clear, he has told us he wants to leave, he has a proposal from PSG and we can't do anything. ""It leaves a bitter taste in my mouth because we have taken care of him so that he is happy here. A little disappointed, yes I am."" feed Barca have been in talks with the forward over a new deal, however Xavi has revealed the club could not financially compete with the contract offer tabled by PSG. He added: ""We cannot compete with the proposal that they've made to him, it's out of our reach. ""It's simple. He came to me with a proposal from PSG. Said that he wanted to leave, that he had spoken with Luis Enrique, with Nasser and has a proposal with which we cannot compete. We have asked him the reason and he has not been able to answer. I sense that it will be something personal. Disappointed? Yes. The important thing is that he has been clear. I wish him luck. ""He looked so happy to me, I did not expect it. That is the market.

Barcelona exploring fresh move for Joao Cancelo,"Aug 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-exploring-fresh-move-joao-cancelo,"Barca showed an interest in the Portugal international during the January transfer window, but were unable to get a deal over the line and he eventually joined Bayern Munich on loan for the rest of the 2022/23 season. Bayern chose not make the move permanent and Cancelo has since returned to City. The German champions have instead turned to Cancelo's City team-mate Kyle Walker and they are still hoping to sign him. Cancelo has little desire to remain at City and the feeling at the club is mutual. Pep Guardiola has not changed his stance in wanting him moved on from the club. Arsenal have shown an interest in Cancelo and they remain keen on the full-back, but it is Barcelona who are now stepping up their efforts. feed Barcelona's finances are still far from secure and any deal will need to be sanctioned by La Liga. However, the likely sale of Ousmane Dembele to PSG means that they will have room to manoeuvre and a new right-back is seen as one of their priorities. Speaking after their pre-season win against AC Milan, head coach Xavi said: ""The right-back is a position that we should look at again, and reinforce. We have players who adapt but they are not in their natural positions. We will see how everything turns out and how we also fit into financial fair play."" Real Vallodolid's Ivan Fresneda is an option they are also considering, but Cancelo is believed to be their main priority and they are ready to push ahead with a move. Barcelona would ideally like a loan with an option to buy for Cancelo, who still has four years left on his current deal at City. 90min understands that Cancelo's camp have already spoken with Barcelona and personal terms will not be an issue."
Arsenal to test Brentford's resolve with offer for David Raya,"Aug 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-test-brentford-resolve-offer-david-raya,"Raya is into the final year of his contract at the Gtech Community Stadium and has publicly admitted to turning down several offers to commit his long-term future to the Bees. Though Brentford are willing to let Raya go this summer, they have reiterated for months that they will only consider offers of Â£40m. 90min were first to report back in March they are even open to him leaving on a free transfer next summer, and this stance remains despite signing Mark Flekken from Freiburg. Tottenham Hotspur had agreed personal terms with Raya in June but were unwilling to meet Brentford's demands and instead signed Guglielmo Vicario from Empoli, while Bayern Munich have also been put off by such a high figure. feed 90min reported on Monday that Arsenal were exploring a deal for Raya, who would crucially count as a homegrown player under Premier League and UEFA regulations. The Gunners have now reached a broad agreement with the Spain international over a contract. Arsenal are now preparing an offer to present to Brentford which could come close to their Â£40m valuation, though this would be made up with a significant sum of add-ons. Raya is pushing for Brentford to allow him to move to the Emirates Stadium, where he is prepared to play second fiddle to Aaron Ramsdale. Arsenal's number one signed a new long-term contract earlier this summer. Meanwhile, the representatives of Arsenal's current backup goalkeeper, Matt Turner, are exploring potential exit routes out of north London. The USMNT stopper is on the radar of Nottingham Forest, while he also has suitors from mainland Europe. Turner is keen to play regular first-team football next season."
Tottenham hold talks with Barcelona over out-of-favour duo,"Aug 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-hold-talks-barcelona-out-of-favour-duo,"Spurs have added Guglielmo Vicario, James Maddison and Manor Solomon to their ranks this summer, while Dejan Kulusevski and Pedro Porro's loans have been made permanent. The top story of Tottenham's window has been regarding a potential outgoing, with Bayern Munich continuing their relentless pursuit of Harry Kane - 90min reported on Tuesday that the German champions remain confident of finalising a deal. 90min understands Spurs are still looking to bring in further players before the transfer deadline and have made enquiries to Barca about midfielder Kessie and defender Lenglet. Kessie has long been a target of Tottenham's and they most recently made an enquiry to Barcelona back in December 2022. 90min reported last month the Ivory Coast international is open to a summer exit amid interest from Juventus and the Saudi Pro League. Juve have now made a loan offer for Kessie and Spurs are weighing up their own move for the 26-year-old. feed Kessie sat out Barcelona's 1-0 pre-season win against Milan due to injury, but head coach Xavi delivered a cryptic update on the midfielder post-match, telling reporters: ""Regarding his future, I can say that he knows exactly what the situation is."" Lenglet, meanwhile, spent the 2022/23 season on loan at Spurs, making 35 appearances and scoring one goal. Sources have told 90min the France international is being considered as a potential fall-back option in case Tottenham fail to sign either of their priority targets in Bayer Leverkusen's Edmond Taposba and Wolfsburg's Micky van de Ven. Spurs have been locked in talks to sign the two young centre-backs for over a month but negotiations have scarcely progressed.

West Ham transfers: Ajax hijack Borges deal; Inter bid for Scamacca & Ward-Prowse move in limbo,"Aug 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-transfers-ajax-borges-inter-bid-scamacca-ward-prowse,"The 19-year-old had looked to be heading to London Stadium in a deal worth just under Â£15m, having scored 21 goals at Premier League 2 level last season. Europa Conference League holders West Ham had agreed to insert a buy-back clause into the deal for Borges, allowing City to re-sign the rapid winger in the future should he prove to be a star turn in east London. But with Borges away playing for Portugal's Under-21s at the European Championship this summer, before taking a holiday, West Ham have not been able to iron out the final details of the deal. And sources have now confirmed to 90min that former Champions League winners Ajax, who had a pretty poor 2022/23 by their usual standards, have stolen in ahead of West Ham to take Borges to Amsterdam. It's understood that personal terms are already agreed between Borges and Ajax, who will pay City the same amount of money West Ham were going to, and he's now heading to the Netherlands to complete a medical.  One factor in his decision is believed to be a more appealing route into regular first team football, which may not have been on offer had he remained in the Premier League playing under David Moyes. 90min previously revealed that the powerful Italian, who only joined West Ham from Sassuolo last summer, was keen to return to Italy, though the Hammers had no intention of letting him leave until a replacement had been sought. The club's recruitment team are yet to make any real progress on that front, despite technical director Tim Steidten recommending Montpellier striker Elye Wahi, but Scamacca is attracting significant interest from his homeland. Roma had previously made West Ham a loan to buy offer worth close to â¬25m (Â£21.5m), but the bid was based on the club qualifying for the Champions League - something that West Ham felt was not a good enough guarantee. Milan and Atalanta have also been showing interest in Scamacca, but sources have confirmed to 90min that Inter have made their first official move. They have also offered to take the the 24-year-old on loan initially, but their bid was only worth â¬2m for the duration of the loan deal before an obligatory purchase of â¬20m. West Ham are believed to want â¬30m (Â£25.8m) for Scamacca, and it's expected that Inter will up their offer having already an approach for Arsenal's Folarin Balogun turned down. West Ham's former captain pocketed the club a British-record Â£105m fee, with the deal including a significant chunk of that money up front - money that was earmarked to sign at least one replacement. Contrasting opinions from Moyes and Steidten have seen West Ham identify a wide variety of potential targets, including Southampton captain James Ward-Prowse. The 28-year-old is facing up to the prospect of playing in the Championship following the south coast club's relegation, but had shown interest in joining West Ham. Moyes had pushed for West Ham to move for Ward-Prowse, but the club's valuation of the set-piece specialist is noticeably different to how Southampton see things - they value him at Â£35m whereas West Ham's offer this summer was only worth Â£20m. Talks have continued, in the hope that the two parties could find a compromise, but at this stage there's no willingness from either party to fold. West Ham have a number of other players to consider and are believed to have also been put off by Ward-Prowse's current wage packet, which pockets him over Â£100,000-per-week. Offers for Conor Gallagher and Joao Palhinha, both players Moyes has targeted because of Premier League experience, have also been rejected, meaning West Ham are no closer to replacing Rice almost three weeks after his departure was officially confirmed. feed"
Sadio Mane officially unveiled by Al Nassr,"Aug 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/sadio-mane-officially-unveiled-al-nassr,"Mane had initially resisted interest from the Saudi Pro League, before performing a surprise U-turn and agreeing personal terms with Al Nassr in July. Bayern were open to selling Mane, who had a disappointing first season following a big money move from Liverpool, as soon as the 2022/23 club campaign ended. At first, it was Al Ettifaq showing interest following the appointment of Steven Gerrard as manager. But terms were quickly agreed once Al Nassr stepped in, with Mane still reluctant to make the move to Saudi Arabia as recently as early July. In the words of Bayern coach Thomas Tuchel, Mane ""fell short of expectations"" during his what will now have been his sole season with the club. feed The Senegal international was often used in an alien central role following the departure of Robert Lewandowski and frustrations eventually boiled over to the point where he physically lashed out at teammate Leory Sane, landing an international suspension and club record fine. Mane now links up with Cristiano Ronaldo at the Riyadh-based Al Nassr. Since signing Ronaldo in the winter, the club have remained busy in the transfer market this summer. Mane is the fourth high profile player to make the switch from Europe in recent weeks, following in the footsteps of Marcelo Brozovic, Seko Fofana and Alex Telles. Mane's quick move on from Bayern without triggering the add-ons in his 2022 transfer from Liverpool is set to deny the Premier League side as much as Â£7.5m in additional income."
Chelsea sign Â£25m midfielder from Rennes,"Aug 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-sign-25m-midfielder-rennes,"The Blues agreed a Â£25m fee with Rennes in late July, prompting the final processes of the transfer â including a medical â to be undertaken in the days since.

It is possible that the teenager could be loaned to new sister club Strasbourg, which would see him remain in Ligue 1, to gain more first-team experience. Despite signing Ugochukwu, Chelsea have also not given up on their pursuit of Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo and are expected to return with an improved offer. Bids worth Â£70m and Â£80m have so far been rejected, with the Seagulls holding out for Â£100m."
Southampton reject second Liverpool bid for Romeo Lavia,"Aug 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/southampton-reject-second-liverpool-bid-for-romeo-lavia,"Lavia has attracted plenty of interest from towards the top of the Premier League after Southampton's relegation, but it is Liverpool who are currently pushing hardest for his signature. A Â£35m bid was knocked back last month and sources have confirmed to 90min that Liverpool have now seen an improved offer, worth Â£42m including add-ons, rejected by Southampton. While Southampton would prefer to keep Lavia, they are prepared to cash in for the right price and have placed a firm price tag of Â£50m on the 19-year-old, who only joined from Manchester City last summer for an initial Â£10.5m. Talks will continue between the two sides and Liverpool are expected to return with an improved bid in the near future, with Jurgen Klopp keen to add a third new face to his midfield after the signings of Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai. feed Liverpool are hopeful a deal can be reached soon but are also looking at potential alternatives if Southampton refuse to drop their asking price. One of those on Liverpool's shortlist is 22-year-old Fluminense midfielder Andre Trindade, who nearly joined Fulham in January and remains on the radar of the Cottagers. Fulham have been in talks with Andre but believe the once-capped Brazil international has his sights set on a move to a team capable of offering regular European football. Alongside Liverpool, Andre's representatives have spoken with Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Arsenal, Tottenham and West Ham. Liverpool have lost both Jordan Henderson and Fabinho to the Saudi Pro League this summer and now hope to find another new midfielder to balance out the squad, with Lavia understood to be Klopp's preferred target."
Diego Simeone gives uncertain update on Joao Felix's future amid Barcelona links,"Aug 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/diego-simeone-gives-uncertain-update-joao-felix-future-barcelona-links,"Felix spent the second half of last season on loan at Chelsea and has been linked with a permanent move away from Atletico this summer, with Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona the most notable parties that are interested in his services.  The forward recently sparked fury at Atleti by publicly admitting he would like to to join Barcelona, leading to furious demonstrations from fans.  In an interview with AS, Simeone declined to give a definite response to questions over Felix's future but warned the Portugal international that 'nobody is bigger than the club'. ""The main focus is the team,"" he said. ""It is normal that in the press the focus is on whether he stays or leaves. I already said that there is no-one more important than the club, with no exceptions. Itâs impossible to be clearer than that."" feed Felix joined Los Rojiblancos back in 2019 for an astonishing Â£103m, and although he has not lived up to his price tag thus far, Simeone did not want to criticise the 23-year-old. ""He has his playing characteristics, he has given his all, he has made an effort to work well with what he has, and what we demanded of him,"" Simeone reflected. ""I cannot have any complaints about his effort because he has given what he could give. ""He has extraordinary ability, we have talked about it a billion times. You see him and he has a good header, a good shot with the left, with the right, good spin, one on oneâ¦ Is there time [for Felix to succeed at Atletico]?

Dusan Vlahovic offered to Chelsea in Romelu Lukaku swap deal,"Aug 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/dusan-vlahovic-offered-to-chelsea-in-romelu-lukaku-swap-deal,"After Inter abandoned their interest in a reunion with Lukaku, Juventus reached out to Chelsea to propose a loan deal for the Belgian but saw their offer instantly rejected, with a temporary departure not in Chelsea's plans. Sources have confirmed to 90min that the Turin outfit have now returned with a fresh proposal, offering Chelsea the chance to land Vlahovic as part of their push to offload Lukaku. Chelsea are known admirers of Vlahovic and made contact with the striker's representatives earlier this summer as part of their search for a new striker. Nicolas Jackson was signed from Villarreal but Blues boss Mauricio Pochettino recently confessed he would be interested in adding another new striker. In negotiations, Juventus have made it clear that they would want Chelsea to pay a fee on top of swapping Lukaku, and the Blues are now considering their options as they seek to finally cut ties with their wantaway striker. feed Lukaku still retains interest from Saudi Arabia but the 30-year-old wants to remain in Europe and dreams of a return to Italy, where Juventus are his only viable suitors after Inter walked away from talks. The Belgian's representatives are now pushing hard for an agreement with Juventus and there is hope that the chance to sign Vlahovic, who managed ten goals in 27 Serie A outings last year, could help accelerate a deal. Chelsea do have a number of names on their radar, including versatile Ajax star Mohammed Kudus. Personal terms have been discussed with the Ghana international, who played as a midfielder under former boss Erik ten Hag but exploded when switched to striker last season. Summer signing Jackson has impressed in pre-season alongside fellow new face Christopher Nkunku, while 21-year-old Armando Broja is hopeful of returning from his ACL injury to hand Pochettino even more options in attack."
Bayern Munich confident of Harry Kane deal after Tottenham meeting,"Aug 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-harry-kane-deal-tottenham-meeting,"Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen and technical director Marco Neppe were both in London on Monday to meet with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy for a second time this summer. Although a deal was not agreed or a even third bid lodged, sources have told 90min that Bayern left the meeting with some confidence that their next offer will be enough to persuade Levy to sell. Bayern have seen two bids rejected by Spurs, the last of which was worth â¬80m (Â£68.5m), and they are now ready to make a third offer which would represent a club-record transfer for the Bavarian giants. Sources believe that Bayern feel that an offer of â¬100m (Â£85.6m) will be enough to persuade Levy and Tottenham to think about taking a deal, even though the north Londoners have made it clear this summer that they do not have a price in mind. manual There is also some pressure on Levy, even within Spurs' hierarchy, to consider selling Kane, rather than run the risk of losing him on a free transfer next summer once his contract expires. Spurs remain confident they can persuade Kane to sign a new contract, to the extent that they're willing to make him the highest-paid player in the Premier League on wages of Â£400,000-per-week. Levy also feels that anyone is capable of convincing the 30-year-old to stay put, it's new head coach Ange Postecoglou. Bayern's belief is that they already have a broad agreement in place with Kane's camp, and that if they can strike an agreement with Spurs, he'll be heading to Munich ready to compete for the Champions League. As it is, Kane is facing up to the prospect of a season without European football - Spurs finished 8th in the Premier League last season and parted ways with head coach Antonio Conte in March."
Jurgen Klopp laughs off Liverpool links to Kylian Mbappe,"Aug 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jurgen-klopp-laughs-off-liverpool-links-to-kylian-mbappe,"With Mbappe declining to trigger the extension in his PSG contract, which expires at the end of the coming season, the Ligue 1 champions are prepared to cash in on him this summer and Liverpool have been touted as potential suitors.

""We laugh about it,"" Klopp told Sky Germany about the rumours. ""I can say that I think he is a really good player. But the financial framework conditions donât suit us at all.

That would be the first time."" manual 90min understands PSG have been seeking to drum up interest in Mbappe this summer with a view to cashing in on the 24-year-old, who club officials fear is already set on joining Real Madrid on a free transfer in 2024. Among the teams to have been contacted are Chelsea who, while obviously more than happy to sign Mbappe, are well aware of just how unlikely such a move would be. The Frenchman's representatives have not yet given any indications that a switch to the Premier League is under consideration. Just what will happen with Mbappe this summer remains to be seen, but whatever decision is taken, new PSG defender Milan Skriniar insists the Parisian squad will accept it. ""It's the club's decision, we have to respect it,"" he told Le Parisien. ""We have a lot of fantastic players."""
Rasmus Hojlund booked in for Man Utd medical,"Aug 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/rasmus-hojlund-booked-man-utd-medical,"After lengthy negotiations with Atalanta, United have agreed to a deal which will see them part with a guaranteed â¬75m (Â£64m, $82.3m), with a further â¬10m (Â£8.6m, $11m) in potential add-ons, to sign the 20-year-old striker. With personal terms agreed earlier in July, all that is left is for Hojlund to pass his medical and sources have confirmed to 90min that the Dane is due in Manchester on Tuesday to undergo his checks. Should all go to plan, Hojlund will become United's third signing of the summer, following Mason Mount and Andre Onana in agreeing moves to Old Trafford. Denmark teammate Christian Eriksen recently gave fans an insight into what they can expect from Hojlund, telling PA: ""What's he like? He's a strong number nine. He's developed a lot in the last year from when I first saw him with the national team [to] a year's time, so, yeah, he's a very good player."" feed Eriksen continued: ""I suppose we don't get enough media attention in Denmark that's why, so people outside Denmark don't know enough. ""He's a nice guy, he's a good player. Like I said, he's developed, turning into just a nine, which he's played for the national team. ""I have to be honest I haven't seen that many games for Atalanta, but I know how they play and he fitted in well there, so, yeah, he's a good player."" United have endured a mixed bag on their pre-season tour of the United States, beating Arsenal 2-0 at SoFi Stadium but also losing to Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund.

Levi Colwill reaches agreement with Chelsea over new contract,"Jul 31, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/levi-colwill-reaches-agreement-chelsea-new-contract,"The England Under-21 international spent the 2022/23 season on loan at Brighton and impressed under Roberto De Zerbi. The Seagulls were keen to sign Colwill permanently and readied a club record offer, while the defender waited for talks with new Blues manager Mauricio Pochettino before deciding his future. Colwill now believes he will feature under the former Tottenham boss at Stamford Bridge, 90min understands, and has agreed the terms on a new contract with Chelsea which will runs into the late 2020s. The 20-year-old's current deal has two years left to run with the option of a further season. Brighton admitted defeat in their pursuit of Colwill as the west London side stood firm in their 'not for sale' stance before interest from Liverpool emerged. The Reds plucked him out as a top target as Colwill revealed his desire to play regularly. feed He said in early July: ""I'll speak to my family, speak to everyone I need to and make a decision. I've got to play at the end of the day, to hopefully get there and go to the next [England senior] camp."" Pochettino's squad is still being streamlined before the transfer window closes but Thiago Silva, Benoit Badiashile and Trevoh Chalobah are among the Argentinian's alternative options to Colwill. Wesley Fofana has suffered another injury setback and won't feature in the early months of the 2023/24 season.

There were concerns the move could fall through due to issues relating to the proposed payment structure, but the deadlock was soon broken and Fabinho underwent a medical. A statement from Liverpool ends: ""Everyone at Liverpool FC would like to thank Fabinho for all of his contributions to the club's successes during the last five years."" Fabinho becomes the second Liverpool midfielder to seal a move to the Saudi Pro League after former club captain Jordan Henderson left Anfield to reunite with old teammate Steven Gerrard at Al Ettifaq. feed The former Monaco star made 219 appearances in total for the Reds after moving to Anfield in 2018, scoring 11 goals. As well as the Champions League and Premier League successes, Fabinho also won both the FA Cup and Carabao Cup during the 2021/22 campaign. The midfielder was picked out for criticism as Liverpool struggled to mount a challenge for Champions League qualification in 2022/23, leading the Reds to strengthen central areas early in the summer transfer window. Alex Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai have been brought in from Brighton and RB Leipzig respectively, while long-time squad members James Milner, Naby Keita, Roberto Firmino and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain have all departed."
PSG contact Chelsea in attempt to push Kylian Mbappe transfer,"Jul 31, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-contact-chelsea-attempt-push-kylian-mbappe-transfer,"PSG are keen to sell Mbappe this summer to avoid losing him for free when his contract expires next year and have made that position clear to the France captain and his representatives. The Ligue 1 champions recently accepted a world record bid of â¬300m (Â£259m) from Al Hilal but Mbappe had no interest in discussing personal terms. Club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has dispatched intermediaries across the world to try and garner more interest, but 90min has been told a host of clubs believe Mbappe is destined for Real Madrid and haven't put effort into chasing him despite their obvious interest in a transfer. Real and Mbappe have both denied PSG's claims that a deal is already in place. 90min understands Al-Khelaifi has now contacted Chelsea and their supremo Todd Boehly about the prospect of signing Mbappe in an attempt to push them towards making an offer. manual While Chelsea would be open to the former Monaco forward's arrival, as would Liverpool and Manchester City, there has been no suggestion from the World Cup winner's camp of a desire to move to England. Mbappe has made it clear publicly he is not pushing to leave this summer, instead informing PSG he will decline his part of a two-way option that would see his contract extended by a further year to 2025. That decision earlier this summer angered PSG, resulting in their 'sell now' stance during the transfer window. The option to extend Mbappe's contract officially ends on Monday at the end of July. Mbappe will then be due a loyalty payment worth â¬40m which PSG will be unable to avoid paying as he has not asked to leave the club at any point. PSG now find themselves in a bind with Mbappe in a dominant position in the transfer saga. They cannot force him out to Al Hilal and are yet to facilitate an exit to Real Madrid or elsewhere this summer. If Mbappe decides to stay put at PSG until 2024, there is nothing they can do to prevent it."
Thomas Frank defends price tag of Arsenal & Bayern Munich target David Raya,"Jul 31, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/thomas-frank-defends-price-tag-arsenal-bayern-munich-target-david-raya,"Having entered the final year of his contract at the Brentford Community Stadium, Raya has attracted interest from a number of top clubs from across Europe but his price tag has thus far proven too high for any suitors to come forward with a bid. Earlier this summer as Tottenham withdrew their interest, Raya himself admitted he felt the Â£40m demand was likely to prevent him from sealing his desired move away from the club. Arsenal are the latest side to voice an interest in Raya, joining Bayern Munich in the race for the Spain international, but despite already seeing suitors drop away because of their asking price, Brentford are determined to stand firm. ""I would love to get Â£40m,"" Frank told the media when asked about Arsenal's interest. ""Thatâs what heâs worth. I think heâs one of the best keepers, he was one of the four best keepers in the Premier League last season, so what is the price? feed ""What was Declan Rice, one year left? Â£105m? Is that a fair price? And [Harry] Kane, you're talking one year left and he will cost what, Â£150m? The keeper is at his best age, I think. ""But anyway, it's a good thing I am not negotiating. That is for Phil [Giles] and Matthew [Benham] and Arsenal and the others, so they must take care of that. I just take care of the coaching.""

Talks are also ongoing with Paris Saint-Germain over midfielder Marco Verratti, who is keen to make the move, and Fulham striker Aleksandar Mitrovic is another key target, but Al Hilal are also looking to make an enormous splash on one of Europe's elite talents. A Â£259m bid for Kylian Mbappe, while accepted by PSG, was knocked back by the player himself, and now Al Hilal are exploring other ways to spend their astronomical budget. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Al Hilal have lodged two bids for Osimhen, worth Â£102m and then Â£120m, but both have been knocked back. An improved offer worth closer to Â£170m is expected to arrive soon. Napoli want to keep Osimhen and are confident of striking an agreement over a new contract in the near future. The Nigeria international is not believed to be keen on a move to Saudi Arabia at this point in his career, despite the offer of wages which would exceed Â£1m per week. feed With Al Hilal desperate to make an enormous splash, officials have also reached out to Tottenham striker Kane over a potential move to the Middle East. Contact has been made with both Tottenham and Kane's representatives but neither have met the interest with any real positivity. Spurs are still keen to try keep hold of Kane, while the England striker is not currently looking to leave Europe. Nevertheless, Al Hilal are weighing up making a firm offer for Kane, who is seen as an alternative to Osimhen. Kane, who is in the final year of his Spurs contract, is the subject of intense interest from Bayern Munich, with representatives of the German side flying into London for further talks with chairman Daniel Levy."

Now, the two Bayern officials are expected to front a group of Bayern representatives which will touch down in London on Monday for their long-awaited talks over Kane's future. Two bids from Bayern have already been knocked back by Levy who, up to this point, has not named an asking price or even given any indication that he would be prepared to accept a bid for his talismanic striker this summer. However, with Kane entering the final year of his contract, Spurs owner Joe Lewis has intervened and is understood to have told Levy to authorise a sale if an agreement to extend Kane's contract cannot be struck. feed A club-record bid from Bayern, whose transfer record currently stands at the â¬80m paid to sign Lucas Hernandez from Atletico Madrid in 2019, is expected to arrive imminently, with the German side determined to take advantage of Kane's expiring contract to get a deal done. There has been plenty of speculation over the reason for the cancellation of last week's meeting between Bayern and Spurs but the German side's president, Herbert Hainer, insisted there was nothing malicious going on. ""Sometimes people read too much into normal processes,"" Hainer told TZ. ""What I can say is that Daniel Levy is a professional. We all have the utmost respect for him."""
Mauricio Pochettino sends pointed transfer message to Chelsea owners,"Jul 31, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/mauricio-pochettino-sends-transfer-message-chelsea-owners,"Fofana has undergone surgery on an ACL injury and is facing a lengthy spell on the sidlines, leaving Chelsea with four senior centre-backs: Thiago Silva, Benoit Badiashile, Levi Colwill and Trevoh Chalobah, the latter of whom has been heavily linked with an exit. A Â£38m deal has been struck with Monaco to sign France international Axel Disasi, a former teammate of Badiashile, and while Pochettino refused to discuss the 25-year-old, he acknowledged a defensive reinforcement is necessary. ""With Fofana's injury, I think it is obvious that maybe we need to reinforce this area,"" he told the media after Sunday's 2-0 friendly victory over Fulham. ""It is clear."" Pochettino is also hoping for senior reinforcements in midfield and wants more than the proposed deal to sign 19-year-old Rennes starlet Lesley Ugochukwu, who is expected to move to Stamford Bridge but could head to sister side Strasbourg on loan. feed ""We need experience in midfield,"" he explained. ""I have the information you have. My information is a player that is from France that maybe they sign with the idea to send on loan."" One area in which Pochettino is not so desperate for signings is at striker. New faces Nicolas Jackson and Christopher Nkunku have both enjoyed impressive pre-season campaign thus far, with the latter bagging his third goal of the summer against Fulham, although the Chelsea boss remains open to another signing up front. ""I think we are happy with the performance and they can complement each other really well,"" he said of his two strikers. ""Yes, of course, maybe we can add some different profile or different player who can help us, of course we are open.

Even though he has already been impressed by Mac Allister, Klopp insisted the 24-year-old is not yet at his best and warned fans he will need time to fully learn his place in Liverpool's system.

Ousmane Dembele agrees personal terms with PSG,"Jul 31, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ousmane-dembele-agrees-personal-terms-psg,"As 90min confirmed last week, PSG recently reached out to the 26-year-old, who has entered the final 12 months of his contract at Camp Nou. Barcelona, however, are keen to keep Dembele and have been locked in talks over a new deal for months, but progress is yet to be made. The France international is eyeing a substantial pay rise after agreeing to slash his wages on the short-term deal he inked with Barcelona only last summer. With no agreement in sight, PSG have made their move in the hope of luring Dembele back to Ligue 1, where he shone with Rennes before his switch to Borussia Dortmund in 2016. Dembele has a clause in his contract that would allow him to leave for â¬50m if it is triggered by midnight on Monday, the end of July, after which the clause doubles to â¬100m. PSG could finalise the signing of Dembele by paying his release clause, and that is an option now personal terms are agreed. An agreement over a five-year deal has been reached between Dembele and PSG, who have informed Barcelona of the situation. The two clubs have held talks and how they develop in the coming hours will determine whether PSG will need to pay the release clause or come to agreement with Barcelona. feed While Barcelona want Dembele to stay, they have also made it clear that they do not want to lose him for nothing next summer and so have reluctantly opened the door to a departure.  The plan at Camp Nou was for Barcelona to part ways with two of their four senior wingers - Dembele, Raphinha, Ansu Fati and Ferran Torres - this summer. Initially, Barcelona wanted to offload Fati and Torres but both have been incredibly reluctant to entertain departures. The La Liga champions, who still hope to raise more funds through player sales this summer, have been forced into taking a decision over Dembele, whose willingness to agree terms with PSG is expected to impact their next move. PSG have made their move for Dembele at the same time as they battle with Kylian Mbappe over his future, but the club insist that their interest in the Barcelona star is not directly related."
Arsenal explore move for Brentford goalkeeper David Raya,"Jul 31, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-explore-move-brentford-goalkeeper-david-raya,"Raya has entered the final 12 months of his contract at the Brentford Community Stadium and has made it clear he is keen to move on this summer, with clubs from across Europe expressing an interest in his services. A number of Premier League sides have looked at Raya, while German giants Bayern Munich are also keen on the Spain international. Arsenal, who wanted Raya before they struck a deal to sign Aaron Ramsdale in the summer of 2021, have now re-joined the race for the 27-year-old. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Arsenal are looking to sign another high-level goalkeeper to provide more competition for Ramsdale and Raya is happy to enter into a battle for a starting spot - a message he also conveyed to Manchester United when the Red Devils enquired earlier this year. feed Brentford have publicly valued Raya at Â£40m and continue to stand firm on that price tag, which already derailed talks with Tottenham and has scared off numerous other suitors. Arsenal are also reluctant to pay such a high fee for a player entering the final year of a contract and, as such, have also enquired about Brighton goalkeeper Robert Sanchez as a possible alternative. Chelsea are also interested in Sanchez, another Spain international. The Gunners are prepared to allow current backup Matt Turner to leave this summer, with a loan exit a possibility at this point.

Chelsea confident of signing Crystal Palace star Michael Olise,"Jul 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-confident-of-signing-crystal-palace-star-michael-olise,"90min recently reported that Olise had attracted interest from Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City during the summer transfer window following an eye-catching 2022/23 campaign with Palace. Last season, Olise became the first Palace player ever to record more than 10 Premier League assists in a single season as he led the south London club to safety alongside fellow young talent Eberechi Eze.  Despite the interest from the Premier League's top two of last season, sources have now confirmed that Chelsea believe they have won the race for Olise's signature. Olise's younger brother, Richard, is also currently on the books and the Blues' strong relationship with the family has helped with the Blues' bid to sign the talented France Under-21 international.  feed Due to a 'mechanism' in his Crystal Palace contract, Olise is available for just Â£35m this summer - a small fee for a talented youngster with proven Premier League experience.  Palace have already moved to try and replace Olise, as well as Wilfried Zaha who left as a free agent to join Galatasaray, as 90min understands that the club are close to sealing a deal to sign Brazilian youngster Matheus Franca.  The south Londoners are set to pay an initial Â£17m plus Â£8.5m in add-ons in order to sign the young attacking midfielder.

How Rasmus Hojlund fee compares to most expensive signings in Man Utd history,"Jul 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/how-rasmus-hojlund-fee-compares-to-most-expensive-signings-in-man-utd-history,"""In Copenhagen,"" Hojlund recalled when looking back on his time at his hometown club, ""they were not really sure about me being the next big thing."" Just 18 months after leaving the capital club for Â£1.5m, with zero goals in Denmark's top flight to his name, Hojlund is now on the cusp of joining Manchester United for a fee in the region of Â£72m - 48 times the sum that Copenhagen received in January 2022. Here's how the transfer of a player that is very much billed as ""the next big thing"" compares to the most expensive deals Manchester United have ever made. Manchester United have agreed a fee with Atalanta for the transfer of Denmark striker Rasmus Hojlund. ð©ð°ð¯https://t.co/rDhWZFVPBY Hojlund needed little persuading to agree on personal terms with United - the club he grew up supporting in Denmark. ""Now that you ask,"" Hojlund admitted in January, ""I will not hide the fact that I am a huge Manchester United fan.""  However, the striker's employers were not so easily wooed. Back at the start of July, 90min revealed United's interest in Hojlund as talks between the Red Devils and Serie A side Atalanta began. United were initially unwilling to venture above their opening offer of Â£51.6m but Atalanta stood firm on their valuation of a player they only signed for Â£15m last summer. Paris Saint-Germain complicated the negotiation process by wading in with a bid of their own. The French champions, who are embroiled in a stand-off with their current star forward Kylian Mbappe, fired a Â£42.9m verbal offer over to Atalanta. It did not take long for the Bergamo outfit to reject the inquiry. Shortly after Erik ten Hag publicly stressed his desire to acquire a striker as soon as possible, United took a large step towards completing the deal by agreeing on a fee with Atalanta. The two parties have arrived at the compromise of a fixed Â£64m up-front sum with Â£8m available in potential add-ons. United had previously floated the idea of including players in a partial swap deal but Atalanta's iron will appears to have won out. Player Year signed Signed from Transfer fee Paul Pogba 2016 Juventus Â£89m Antony 2022 Ajax Â£82m Harry Maguire 2019 Leicester Â£80m Romelu Lukaku 2017 Everton Â£75m Jadon Sancho 2021 Borussia Dortmund Â£73m Rasmus Hojlund 2023 Atalanta Â£72m* Casemiro 2022 Real Madrid Â£60m Mason Mount 2023 Chelsea Â£60m Angel Di Maria 2014 Real Madrid Â£59.7m Andre Onana 2023 Inter Â£47.2m Hojlund stands to become United's most expensive signing in a summer of consolidation ahead of Ten Hag's second season as manager.  feed The five-time Champions League winner was 30 when United forked out an initial sum of Â£60m last summer. Aside from a surprisingly active disciplinary record, Casemiro proved to be good value for money after his debut campaign. Hojlund, aged just 20, has plenty of time to live up to his transfer."
Why Sadio Mane's proposed Saudi Arabia transfer will cost Liverpool,"Jul 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/why-sadio-mane-proposed-saudi-arabia-transfer-will-cost-liverpool,"The deal agreed between Liverpool and Bayern Munich for Mane last summer started at around Â£27.5m in a guaranteed transfer fee. But the overall package was inflated by Â£7.5m worth of add-ons that were dependent on the player hitting certain targets in Bavaria. Such performance-based add-ons can often include things like appearances or goals. But Mane didn't have a particularly good debut season with Bayern, playing only 25 times in the Bundesliga, scoring just nine league goals and generally underperforming. manual At one stage, Mane was internally suspended by Bayern and fined a club record amount for lashing out at teammate Leroy Sane, with coach Thomas Tuchel eventually concluding that the Senegal international had fallen 'short of expectations'. Now that he is set to move on from Bayern to join Al Nassr, the Daily Mail has reported it will cost Liverpool. The various add-ons in the 2022 transfer agreement didn't end up being triggered and are set to be lost as soon as the player has a new club. Liverpool would have been hopefully of those add-ons being achievable, yet now won't see that additional money coming in. Mane was initially resistant of a switch to the Saudi Pro League. As 90min reported at the time, Al Ettifaq were the team initially interested in signing the 31-year-old. However, not long after making clear his intention not to engage with talks, Mane agreed personal terms with Al Nassr in principle."
Chelsea close to deal for Monaco centre-back Axel Disasi,"Jul 31, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-close-to-deal-for-monaco-centre-back-axel-disasi,"In response to a thoroughly disappointing 12th-placed finish in the Premier League last season, Chelsea's ownership embarked upon a fire sale during the opening month of the summer window. More than Â£200m has been raised in player sales this summer - most of which were completed before 30 June so that they could be included in the accounts for the 2022/23 campaign. After jettisoning the likes of Kai Havertz, Mateo Kovacic and Christian Pulisic, Chelsea are now in a position to provide new manager Mauricio Pochettino with fresh recruits. Chelsea signed Disasi's former teammate Benoit Badiashile from Monaco in January and, just seven months later, are closing in on a reunion for the duo in west London. 90min understands that the Blues are in talks with Monaco and a fee in the region of Â£38m has been floated. feed Chelsea were one of three Premier League clubs that sent scouts to watch Disasi at Monaco in April, as 90min revealed. Manchester United have prioritised other areas of the pitch while Manchester City's focus has shifted to RB Leipzig centre-back Josko Gvardiol. Chelsea have also harboured a long-term interest in the Croatian defender but are expected to miss out on the 21-year-old as City prepare a world-record bid. Newcastle United also showed interest in the 25-year-old but, just like Manchester United, never made an official bid - much to Disasi's disappointment after targeting a move this summer. The day before the news broke of Chelsea's impending agreement with Disasi, 90min reported that the Blues had taken a major step in the recruitment of Rennes midfielder Lesley Ugochukwu.  Chelsea are thought to be open to loaning Ugochukwu to their sister club Strasbourg in Ligue 1 but Disasi is expected to stay in the capital and provide some much-needed cover for a thin defence. Following Wesley Fofana's ACL surgery earlier this summer, Chelsea only have two right-footed options at centre-back; 38-year-old Thiago Silva and Trevoh Chalobah, who has attracted interest from several Premier League clubs. The club felt this was inadequate. The Blues did explore the option of bringing Crystal Palace centre-back Marc Guehi back to Stamford Bridge this summer but baulked at the lofty asking price and the player's wage demands. Former Manchester United skipper Harry Maguire also emerged as a shock alternative in the search for Fofana replacements. The England international would have initially arrived on loan but, again, the overall package proved too rich for Chelsea's taste."
Thomas Tuchel hints at Bayern Munich confidence in signing Harry Kane,"Jul 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/thomas-tuchel-hints-at-bayern-munich-confidence-in-signing-harry-kane,"Bayern retain longstanding interest in Kane and have been tracking the Tottenham striker ever since Robert Lewandowski was sold to Barcelona last summer without being directly replaced.

Speaking after Barca's impressive 3-0 win over Madrid in Dallas, Texas, on Saturday night, manager Xavi addressed the club's lack of spending this summer, and revealed that he has informed Barcelona president Joan Laporta of the need to strengthen the first-team squad: ""I think are lacking [a few players].

With Barcelona's squad lacking depth, Xavi has relied upon a number of young players during pre-season and one of which thoroughly impressed during their cameo appearance against Real Madrid on Saturday.  20-year-old Fermin Lopez Martin scored a stunning goal in the win, and Xavi was keen to praise the youngster in his post match press conference, saying: ""He is a talented footballer...He can play on the right, on the left, as a free winger.

Xavi provides update on Ousmane Dembele's future amid PSG interest,"Jul 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/xavi-provides-update-on-ousmane-dembele-future-amid-psg-interest,"90min reported earlier this week that the Ligue 1 champions had opened talks with Barcelona over a potential move for Dembele to the Parc des Princes. The France international is available for as little as â¬50m (Â£42.9m) before July 31 due to a release clause in his contract - a release which doubles after that date.  News of PSG's interest emerged due to Dembele's contract talks with Barca not progressing as the club had initially hoped. While talks are due to continue, sources have told 90min that Xavi Hernandez's side would be willing sell the player for the right price if he asks to leave.  Despite the rumours circling regarding his future, Dembele has been one of the stars of Barcelona's pre-season, scoring in both the defeat to Arsenal and the thoroughly impressive 3-0 win over El Clasico rivals Real Madrid on Saturday night in Dallas, Texas.  feed In his press conference after that win, manager Xavi was quizzed by the press about Dembele's future:  ""We will see, in the transfer window you never know. ""I see Ousmane as happy at Barca. If thereâs something [in the PSG links] he will tell us. For now heâs here and heâs happy."" As well as discussing potential outgoings, Xavi also stressed the need for Barcelona to strengthen their squad this summer too, saying: ""I think are lacking [a few players].

Rasmus Hojlund potential shirt numbers at Man Utd,"Jul 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/rasmus-hojlund-potential-shirt-numbers-at-man-utd,"Hojlund only joined Atalanta last summer, but the 20-year-old has shown enough long-term potential with his 10 goals in 34 appearances - all the while sharing minutes with more senior players - to convince United to part with a guaranteed Â£64m (â¬75m). Another Â£8.5m (â¬10m) is in add-ons. Atalanta had earlier rejected three offers from United, the most recent reaching Â£50m. But personal terms over a proposed five-year contract had already been agreed with Hojlund and a move to Old Trafford has long been the player's desired outcome this summer. Hojlund was not involved as Atalanta faced Bournemouth in a pre-season friendly on Saturday, while the Bergamo side have already secured his replacement in the shape of El Bilal Toure from Almeria. Erik ten Hag is known for his ability to develop and nurture young talent from his years at Ajax and United have been crying out for a new central striker ever since Edinson Cavani and Cristiano Ronaldo left the club within a few months of each other. Hojlund, although raw, comes in at potentially just half the price of a more established goalscorer like Harry Kane or Victor Osimhen. As long as there are no unexpected hitches, Hojlund will soon join Mason Mount and Andre Onana in making the switch to Manchester United this summer. feed Hojlund has no real fixed attachment to a particular shirt number, largely because his fledgling career has already seen him move around quite a bit."

The Red Devils had previously pitched the idea of offering players in exchange, but Atalanta weren't interested. Arsenal and Chelsea were among the clubs previously interested in Hojlund, having scouts present for the striker's Denmark debut. United among other clubs were then informed he would cost around â¬70m, with Harry Kane and Victor Osimhen among their former targets. United's struggles up front were evident in 2022/23 despite their Carabao Cup success and Champions League qualification.

He is the latest Barca player to leave this window following the previous exits of Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba, Samuel Umtiti and Alex Collado. Alongside Gundogan and Romeu, the reigning Spanish champions have also brought in Inigo Martinez on a free transfer from Athletic Club and signed Brazilian forward Vitor Roque to come into effect in 2024/25.

Chelsea reach agreement to sign Rennes midfielder Lesley Ugochukwu,"Jul 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-reach-agreement-sign-rennes-midfielder-lesley-ugochukwu,"The Blues are keen to bolster in midfield this summer and have focused their efforts on Brighton's Moises Caicedo, recently seeing a bid of Â£80m rejected for the Ecuador international. Caicedo sits at the top of a lengthy midfield shortlist which also includes targets who fit into Chelsea's model of buying high-potential youngsters for the future. Sources have confirmed Blues officials have moved to bring in one of those young stars by striking a deal for Ugochukwu. A fee of around Â£25m has been agreed with Rennes, who have now granted the teenager permission to undergo a medical.

8 players whose clubs would benefit from a Saudi Pro League sale,"Jul 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/8-players-whose-clubs-would-benefit-from-saudi-pro-league-sale,"Whilst there is a fear among fans and clubs that any player can have their mouth stuffed with gold, there are certain situations where the Saudi Pro League is doing European clubs a big favour. Premier League clubs in particular find it very hard to identify buyers for unwanted players boasting wages or a perceived transfer value that many European clubs cannot afford. For this reason, there are some players around Europe right now who might be hoping that a Saudi Pro League club comes in for them, and some clubs who may, deep down, be thinking the same thing. manual AC Milan have been incredibly busy this summer in the transfer market with Marco Sportiello and Luka Romero snagged on free transfers along with Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Christian Pulisic, Tijjani Reijnders and Samuel Chukwueze for a total spend of around Â£78m - more than any other club in the division. Those purchases have been partially funded by Sandro Tonali's sale but more departures are needed. Two players at the top of the list of expendables are Divock Origi and Ante Rebic. The two forwards offered little last season and were left out of the US tour squad. Milan want transfer fees for them. Besiktas have been very interested in Rebic but want to loan him with an option to buy, while Milan are pushing for a full sale. Saudi Arabian clubs can offer that and interest in Rebic from the Middle East already exists. As for Origi, the Premier League may be a more realistic option but he has the hallmarks of a player that may end up in Saudi Arabia. Chelsea have had a lot of involvement with Saudi Pro League clubs this summer as N'Golo Kante, Edouard Mendy and Kalidou Koulibaly have headed in that direction. They have also been very keen for Hakim Ziyech to do the same. The Moroccan had seemed destined for Al Nassr but the move fell through. He has wanted to leave Chelsea for a while now and the club certainly don't need him given the number of wide players they have. As for Romelu Lukaku, Chelsea would like to sell him as soon as possible to bring the whole affair to a close. There was an offer from Saudi Arabia earlier in the window but Lukaku is determined to remain in Europe. Unless a move to Juventus starts to get off of the ground, he could be left with the choice of Saudi Arabia or the reserves at Chelsea. Hugo Lloris has already announced his intention to leave Tottenham this summer and the club are not going to stand in his way. There are a number of potential options available to the Frenchman and at 36 years old, few would begrudge him pursuing a payday in Saudi Arabia. That would lead to a clean break for Spurs, but there is European interest in Lloris too. Inter need two goalkeepers and Lloris is a contender to become the number one. Manchester United have been traditionally bad at selling players. Many stay for far too long on contracts that are far too big for any other club to match. Given both Fred and Harry Maguire are now deemed as surplus to requirements, especially if other signings arrive, they are in danger of heading down that same road. The potential signing of Sofyan Amrabat would speed up Fred's exit, with Galatasaray and Saudi Arabian clubs showing interest. Fred would command a big wage in the Middle East and at 30 he is young enough to potentially return to a decent level in Europe.  Unless a new defender arrives, there is a good chance that Maguire will stay at United as a squad option. He wants to play football, though, and he may choose to take himself out of the spotlight and spend a couple of seasons in Saudi Arabia if an offer arrives. Although, that exit could compromise his involvement for England. It would be a shame for Paul Pogba's second spell at Juventus to end like this, but he is the best-paid player in the squad and they will not find anyone to match those wages in Europe. Injuries have ravaged Pogba's return to the Bianconeri and there is serious talk of Juve just cutting their losses. The general belief seems to be that Pogba wants to stay at Juventus and fight for his place and his fitness next season, but should Juventus tell him that it is time to go, Saudi Arabia may be the only place he can go that wouldn't involve a pay cut. The PIF-backed duo of Al Ahli and Al Ittihad are both interested."
Brentford hold firm on David Raya asking price in Bayern Munich talks,"Jul 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/brentford-hold-firm-david-raya-asking-price-bayern-munich-talks,"The German giants are set to part ways with Yann Sommer this summer and are on the lookout for a new high-level stopper to cover for the injured Manuel Neuer, who has not played since breaking his leg during a holiday after the World Cup. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Raya has emerged on Bayern's radar and talks have been held with Brentford, but the Bees remain adamant that they will only do business if their asking price of Â£40m is met. Raya is in the final year of his contract at the Brentford Community Stadium and has previously admitted concerns over his asking price, which proved problematic in talks with Tottenham earlier this summer. Spurs did not want to pay Â£40m and ended up turning their attention to Guglielmo Vicario, eventually signing the stopper from Empoli for less than half that figure. feed The same fee has been put to Bayern, who are considering their next move in a summer which has already seen Kim Min-jae, Raphael Guerreiro and Konrad Laimer make the move to the Allianz Arena. Bayern brought in Sommer in January after learning of Neuer's injury and the Swiss international helped lead the team to yet another Bundesliga title, but the 34-year-old is now expected to leave just six months later. Inter are known to be keen as they seek to replace Andre Onana, who has joined Manchester United. Sommer has a release clause in his Bayern contract and the club's honourary president, Uli Hoeness, recently confirmed they would not stand in the goalkeeper's way if he chooses to leave. ""He has a clause that he could leave if he wanted to,"" Hoeness revealed earlier this month. ""We have opened talks with him, we told him so. We will consider each other's perspectives."""

""I was prepared to open talks with Man Utd and bid for Fred, but Maurizio Sarri told me no - he doesnât want Fred,"" Lotito told Il Messaggero.

Mason Mount has already been signed to bolster Erik ten Hag's midfield and the Dutch boss is hopeful of making another addition, with Fiorentina's Sofyan Amrabat known to be high on his wish list.

Chelsea dismiss Romelu Lukaku loan enquiry from Juventus,"Jul 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-dismiss-romelu-lukaku-loan-enquiry-juventus,"Lukaku has just returned from a loan spell with Inter and is set to leave Chelsea in the coming weeks after being left out of Mauricio Pochettino's squad for the pre-season tour of the United States. Inter had been leading the charge for his signature but shockingly abandoned their lengthy pursuit of the striker amid suspicions that he had been negotiating with Juventus, despite Lukaku claiming both privately and publicly that he would never entertain a move to another Italian side. Former Inter teammate Lautaro Martinez recently admitted he was 'disappointed' with Lukaku's behaviour this summer. Juventus are interested in signing Lukaku and have reached out to Chelsea over a possible loan deal, and while the Blues are welcoming discussions about the Belgian, they are not currently entertaining a temporary deal. feed Chelsea want to sell Lukaku permanently and continue to push for an agreement that would see them part ways with the 30-year-old and his high wages altogether. Sources close to Chelsea believe that the Blues would accept a loan offer if it included a mandatory purchase clause, with the plan currently to find a solution which would definitively bring an end to Lukaku's second spell at Stamford Bridge. An offer remains on the table from Saudi Arabia. Lukaku snubbed a transfer to the Middle East earlier this summer and is understood to be keen to remain in Europe, with a return to Italy his preferred move at this point. However, with limited interest in his services, all potential options are being explored and the approach from Saudi Arabia has not yet been completely rejected. Lukaku, who turned 30 in May, still has three years remaining on the contract he signed when he rejoined Chelsea from Inter for Â£97.5m in 2021."

The defender has consistently reiterated his desire to stay at Old Trafford and fight to be part of Ten Hag's plans, however the club are hopeful that he will ultimately change his stance regarding his own future.  Tottenham Hotspur had been among the clubs said to be interested in signing the out-of-favour centre-back, and 90min understands that West Ham have also joined the race in recent weeks due to David Moyes identifying the player as an ideal defensive reinforcement.

McTominay is seen as a potential replacement for Declan Rice this summer, who left the club for Arsenal in a British record deal earlier in July.

PSG open talks with Barcelona over Ousmane Dembele,"Jul 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-talks-barcelona-ousmane-dembele,"The 26-year-old became one of the most expensive players in the world back in 2017, moving to Camp Nou from Borussia Dortmund in a deal worth an initial Â£90m. But his six seasons in Spain have yielded just 127 appearances in La Liga - an average of just over 21 games per campaign - because of a numerous injury problems, and he's yet to score more than eight league goals in a single season. Barcelona claimed a convincing 2022/23 La Liga title win under the management of club legend Xavi, but Dembele was restricted to just 16 starts and found the back of the net just five times in the 25 appearances he made overall. Despite his inconsistency and struggles to stay fit, Barcelona have been talking to Dembele over extending the two-year contract he penned in July 2022, when he was strongly linked with a move away from the club. However, 90min understands that the talks have not progressed as smoothly as Barcelona or Dembele would have liked, reigniting the interest of long-term admirers PSG. feed Sources have confirmed that contact has been made between PSG and Barcelona over a potential deal for Dembele, who would be available for as little as â¬50m (Â£42.9m) before July 31 due to a release clause in his contract.

Dembele could yet sign a contract extension at Camp Nou, with talks due to continue, but Barcelona would also be opening to selling him for the right price. The Catalan giants' financial woes are well documented, and they have already made wing counterparts Ansu Fati and Ferran Torres available for transfer this summer in a bid to raise funds.

Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal have had a world record Â£259m offer accepted by PSG, but Mbappe currently has no intention of negotiating a move to the Middle East, despite the riches on offer. Instead, he wants to fulfil his boyhood dreams by joining Real Madrid.

Arsenal continue pursuit of Brazilian talent identified by Edu,"Jul 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-continue-pursuit-brazil-talent-edu,"The 23-year-old has just two years of first team football under his belt in Brazil, one of which was spent in Serie B, but has attracted the interest of a number of clubs from around Europe. 90min revealed earlier this month that Arsenal were among those interested in striking a deal with Gremio, and that representatives had been dispatched to South America to discuss a transfer. Negotiations are ongoing between the two clubs, with Gremio's asking price believed to be around the Â£8.5m (â¬10m; $10.8m) mark. Bitello is understood to be eager to move continents, and Arsenal are confident they are at the head of the queue for a player who has been picked out by their sporting director Edu, thanks to his sources in his homeland. feed However, sources have also confirmed to 90min that Arsenal are not the only club who have made an approach for Bitello in recent weeks, with Monaco, Porto and Zenit St Petersburg all holding conversations about the verstile midfielder. Indeed, a number of clubs were represented at Gremio's Copa do Brasil semi-final clash with Flamengo on Thursday, keeping a close eye on Bitelli's performance. Gremio president Alberto Guerra confirmed earlier this month that there was interest in Bitello but insisted in regards to an offer being made: âThere are a lot of people watching Bitello, but a proposal, even to reassure our fans, there is none at the moment"". Arsenal have enjoyed themselves in the summer transfer market, strengthening Mikel Arteta's squad with a trio of big-money signings.

Ajax director confirms interest in Mohammed Kudus & Edson Alvarez,"Aug 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ajax-director-confirms-interest-mohammed-kudus-edson-alvarez,"90min reported earlier in the week that Chelsea had reached out to Kudus' representatives to strike an agreement over personal terms, while Arsenal, Manchester United and Brighton also retain interest in the 22-year-old. ""There are clubs that have informally enquired about him,"" Mislintat told Ajax Life. ""I donât expect an offer very soon, although you know that things can be different in the football world. Perhaps the interest in not as serious as everyone thinks."" feed In a separate interview with Aglemeen Dagblad, Mislintat acknowledged that Ajax could lose both Kudus and West Ham target Edson Alvarez, but warned suitors that the Dutch outfit will not sell without first finding a replacement. ""There is no fixed deadline, but there are agreements we must have to get replacements if we have not already done so proactively,"" he explained. ""Their stay or sale also depends on what we will do next. ""The best thing for is if Kudus and Alvarez stay, then we keep two top players. But it is also possible that one goes, or both. ""It is important for us that the relationship with the players remains good. This can be done by being transparent and applying good principles. As we get closer to the deadline, the transfer fee, for example, goes up."""
Barcelona forward rules out summer transfer,"Jul 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-forward-rules-out-summer-transfer,"Torres, a â¬55m signing from Manchester City in January 2022, has managed 14 goals in 71 games for the Blaugrana and actually played fewer La Liga minutes last season than during his first six months at the club, despite making 15 more appearances. Indeed, Torres started just 14 times for Xavi's side last season, with the likes of Raphinha and Ousmane Dembele well ahead in the pecking order. With Barcelona needing to raise money this summer, Torres has been touted as a likely casualty but, as 90min reported last month, the 23-year-old is not interested in a move away. ""The rumours are put there by journalists. I have a contract here, I'm going to stay,"" Torres told the media. feed ""I have it clear in my head, I am qualified to play for BarÃ§a. What is said about me doesn't matter to me. I have to be calm with myself and work as hard as possible because, in the end, the reward always arrives."" Torres did, however, acknowledge the need to improve after an underwhelming individual campaign. ""I am my first critic,"" he confessed. ""Last season was not good but it is one of the ones I have learned the most from in my career. Those ups and downs I had are helping me to be stronger now."" One potential avenue for more minutes would be a move to a central striker to offer cover for 34-year-old Robert Lewandowski who, until Vitor Roque arrives next year, is the only natural in the position in Xavi's squad. ""The more versatility I have, the more options there are to play,"" Torres added. ""I can play on both wings, forward or second striker. It's good for me and for the team."""

Sources close to Brighton have indicated that the offer was rejected almost as soon as it arrived, with the Seagulls showing no sign of budging from their Â£100m valuation of Caicedo. The Ecuador international, who signed a new contract with Brighton after seeing a January transfer to Arsenal fail to materialise, has indicated to his clubs that he would like the chance to move. But he also still understands that they won't sell until their valuation is met. feed Chelsea have long considered Caicedo their top transfer target in the summer market, but will have to return with another improved bid to make their ambition a reality and it is expected that they will. Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi remains committed to using Caicedo whilst he still can and the 21-year-old remains a key part of the squad for at least the time being. ""Iâm happy if Moises stays and plays with us. We will play anyway without him. We have to be ready to find another midfielder if Caicedo leaves,"" said De Zerbi from America, where Brighton are on a pre-season tour.

Atalanta agree transfer for Rasmus Hojlund replacement wanted by Everton,"Jul 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/atalanta-agree-transfer-rasmus-hojlund-replacement-man-utd-everton,"United have had two previous offers rejected for Hojlund so far this summer but put in a bid worth Â£51.4m, including add-ons, on Wednesday for the 20-year-old Dane. Paris Saint-Germain have since made a rival verbal bid for a lesser amount, totalling Â£42.9m, with Atalanta are holding out for Â£60m. Hojlund has already indicated to Atalanta that he wants the opportunity to join United, with the playerâs camp also making the Old Trafford club aware of that. feed The Serie A club appear to at least be planning for life without him as only a medical now stands between Toure and a completed transfer. 90min understands that everything is agreed over a â¬31m (Â£26.6m) transfer that includes add-ons.

Everton had also been interested in Toure, an Ivory Coast international, but the Toffees were unable to raise the funds to make an acceptable offer of their own. Toure only joined Almeria last summer and went on to score the winning goal against eventual La Liga champions Barcelona in February â the clubâs first ever win over the Catalan giants. He had first arrived in Europe from Africa in January 2020, spending two and a half years with Reims. Toureâs imminent transfer to Atalanta will be viewed positively in the red half of Manchester."
When does the transfer window close? 2023 summer deadline day date,"Jul 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/when-does-transfer-window-close-2023-summer-deadline-day-date,"Every single transfer window in recent years has left us wondering how things can get any more dramatic, confusing and ridiculous, and 2023 certainly isn't looking to be any different. With the domestic leagues in Europe coming back much sooner than you might realise, some clubs will be getting concerned about a lack of business. That is when things can get really dramatic. The closer we get to the end of the transfer window, the weirder the deals become. Clubs realise they simply have to get a striker through the door, and they will pay what is needed even for a player they previously had little to no interest in. Think of Odion Ighalo or Wout Weghorst's spells at Manchester United.  manual Having opened on June 14, the summer transfer window for Premier League teams is going to slam shut on September 1, at 23:00 BST. That means that most teams will play around three league games before the window closes, providing further info as to whether new players are needed. The window will close at the same time in the EFL, but there will be some variation around the major leagues in Europe. Serie A, La Liga, the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 all shut on September 1, but the times are not the same for everyone which always causes an added layer of panic for clubs. The Dutch Eredivisie shuts on August 31, while Turkish and Portuguese clubs will be buying players up until September 15 and 22 respectively - opening up the possibility of sales without the ability to replace. Perhaps more importantly, the Saudi Pro League transfer window is open until September 20. *All times BST.

It is the wages that are really shocking people.  In terms of the biggest fees, Declan Rice's move to Arsenal from West Ham was a whopper, as was Jude Bellingham's move from Borussia Dortmund to Real Madrid. The likes of Kai Havertz, Andre Onana, Mason Mount, Dominik Szoboszlai and Christopher Nkunku have all been the subjects of major moves.

Lautaro Martinez 'disappointed' with Romelu Lukaku over Inter saga,"Jul 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/lautaro-martinez-disappointed-with-romelu-lukaku-over-inter-saga,"The two clubs had been locked in transfer talks for months and were finally nearing an agreement when Lukaku failed to return Inter's calls and was accused of holding talks with fierce rivals Juventus, despite having insisted he was only interested in a return to San Siro. Inter wasted little time in abandoning their pursuit of the Belgian and ending hopes of yet another reunion between Martinez and Lukaku, who were one of Europe's fiercest strike forces just a few years ago. The behaviour of Lukaku, who had publicly and privately insisted he would never entertain a move to another Italian side, also took a toll on Martinez, who spoke to La Gazzetta dello Sport about the whole saga. ""I was disappointed, itâs the truth,"" he said. ""I also tried to call him in those days of chaos, he never answered me, the same he did with my other teammates.  feed ""After so many years together, after so many things lived together, I was disappointed. Thankfully, itâs his choice. I wish him the best. But I didnât expect this attitude."" Lukaku was left out of Chelsea's pre-season squad as the Blues continue to try and drum up interest in the Belgian. Juventus are known admirers but must resolve the future of Dusan Vlahovic before considering a formal bid, while Lukaku has rebuffed interest from Saudi Arabia in the hope of landing a new club in Europe. Offers from the Middle East remain on the table but the final decision rests with Lukaku, who still has three years remaining on his Chelsea contract and is set to net the Blues an enormous loss on the Â£97.5m they paid to sign him just two years ago. A fee of Â£40m was quoted to Inter before the breakdown in talks."
Chelsea hatch Strasbourg plan for Arsen Zakharyan as Blues lodge Elye Wahi offer,"Jul 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-hatch-strasbourg-plan-for-arsen-zakharyan-elye-wahi-offer,"20-year-old Zakharyan first emerged as a target for Chelsea last summer but complications over dealing with a Russian club in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine ultimately rendered a deal impossible, and attempts to reignite negotiations in January also fell flat. Since then, a number of clubs have expressed an interest in Zakharyan, who is free to leave Dynamo Moscow this summer after entering the final 12 months of his contract. Feyenoord and Lazio are both understood to have reached out, forcing Chelsea to explore their options to recruit the Russia international. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea's owners, who also control a majority stake in Ligue 1 side Strasbourg, are now hoping to strike a deal which would see the French side sign Zakharyan this summer instead. A fee of just Â£8.6m is expected to be enough to get a deal over the line, with a number of European sides sensing the chance to strike a bargain. feed Elsewhere, Chelsea have lodged a verbal offer of Â£21m for Montpellier striker Elye Wahi, who the Blues hope to loan to Strasbourg for the coming campaign. 20-year-old Wahi racked up 19 goals and six assists in Ligue 1 last season and, like Zakharyan, has plenty of suitors from across Europe, and so Chelsea are trying to move early to win the race for his signature. Montpellier value Wahi at closer to Â£30m but talks between the two clubs are ongoing with a view to reaching a compromise. If Chelsea can agree a deal, they will offer Wahi the chance to spend next season on loan with Strasbourg, although the Blues are prepared to find the striker another temporary home if such a move does not appeal to Wahi. Chelsea's transfer strategy has already begun to take shape at Strasbourg, who have signed 20-year-olds Abakar Sylla and Emanuel Emegha for Â£17m and Â£11m respectively. The deals are the two most expensive in Strasbourg history."
Jurgen Klopp sends goodbye message to Jordan Henderson after Al Ettifaq transfer,"Jul 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jurgen-klopp-sends-goodbye-message-jordan-henderson-al-ettifaq-transfer,"Henderson ended his 12-year career at Anfield to reunite with fellow former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard at Saudi Pro League club Al Ettifaq, signing a three-year deal which will see him reportedly earn Â£700,000-per-week.  In an interview on Liverpool's official website, Liverpool manager Klopp addressed the club captain's exit, admitting the Reds will miss him heading into the 2023/24 campaign. ""Monday when we arrived back in Liverpool, Hendo was waiting for us to say goodbye properly to the team and to the coaching staff as well, so that was a really nice gesture - a really nice thing to do,"" Klopp revealed. ""I know it was a really, really tough decision for Hendo and I was around or with him all the way. It's sad, absolutely strange, because he is the only captain I had here at Liverpool, but I think it is exciting for him as well.  ""We will miss him, without a shadow of a doubt, that's clear - as a man and as a player. But, as I said, that's football."" feed Klopp also discussed the legacy Henderson will leave at Liverpool, having captained the side to both a Premier League and UEFA Champions League triumph. ""In the future when people are looking back then they will realise Jordan Henderson was the skipper of [our] most successful squad until then - I hope we can create another one - and the skipper of the first Premier League title winners and all these kind of things,"" Klopp explained. ""That's a special career. He should be and will be in the future proud of it."" 90min understands that Liverpool are currently in the market to find a replacement for Henderson, and are preparing a second bid for Romeo Lavia in the coming days having seen an initial bid be rejected by the midfielder's current club Southampton.

Man Utd continue Sofyan Amrabat talks and work on midfielder exit,"Jul 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-sofyan-amrabat-talks-midfielder-exit,"The Red Devils slipped to a 2-0 defeat to Real Madrid in their latest pre-season friendly in Houston, where it was apparent that Erik ten Hag's side are in desperate need of a new striker. Ten Hag admitted as much after the game, revealing the club are ""working 24/7"" on addressing the issue, and United's current priority is finalising the capture of Atalanta striker Rasmus Hojlund, whom they made a Â£51.4m bid for on Wednesday. PSG are also interested in the highly-rated Dane, but Ten Hag has stressed the importance of United completing their transfer business before the new Premier League season begins. Crucially, Hojlund's preference is to head to Old Trafford. 90min confirmed earlier this month that United were also looking to address some issues in central midfield, and had opened talks with Fiorentina over Amrabat, who helped his club reach the final of last season's Europa Conference League and was a standout player for Morocco at the 2022 World Cup. feed Those talks are continuing to be held, 90min understands, although United do not have a clear run at Amrabat's signature. La Liga heavyweights Atletico Madrid are also interested in signing a new defensive midfielder and have him on a three-player shortlist of targets alongside Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Marco Verratti - though the latter now seems destined to join Al Hilai in Saudi Arabia.  Indeed, Spanish sources believe they are a very real threat to United's pursuit of Amrabat. United are also working hard on moving on some of their squad players, and progress is being made in regards to selling Fred to Turkish giants Galatasaray. The Brazilian's departure would free up valuable room on United's wage bill, and after an opening bid from Gala was turned down, negotiations are ongoing between the two parties. Sources have told 90min there's a confidence of that deal eventually being agreed, which is a key factor in United progressing their move for Amrabat. United have already signed Mason Mount and Andre Onana in big-money deals this summer - moves made to strengthen United's squad ahead of a return to the Champions League."
Jordan Henderson completes move to Al Ettifaq,"Jul 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jordan-henderson-completes-move-al-ettifaq,"The England international has reunited with Reds legend Steven Gerrard, who recently decided to take up Al Ettifaq's offer to become their new manager. 90min first revealed at the start of July that Gerrard wanted to bring in former teammate Henderson as one of his first signings. And Henderson has now put pen to paper on a contract with Al Ettifaq, bringing an end to his 12-year stay at Anfield. The midfielder posted a lengthy farewell message to fans on Wednesday and received his own parting statement from Liverpool, who wished their former captain well after he helped inspire one of the club's most successful periods. manual ""As his Anfield chapter now comes to a close with a move to Al Ettifaq in Saudi Arabia, everybody at Liverpool Football Club wishes to place on record their thanks and gratitude for everything Jordan Henderson did for the club during his 12 years as a Red,"" the club's long statement ended. Henderson signed for Liverpool in 2011 from Sunderland, though struggled to make much of a good impression during his first few seasons on Merseyside. He emerged as one of their key players under Brendan Rodgers during the 2013/14 season in which they just missed out on the Premier League title, and he was handed the captain's armband following Gerrard's departure in 2015. Henderson leaves Liverpool having won eight trophies - including seven as captain - and having made 492 appearances for the club, scoring 33 goals."
PSG lodge bid to rival Man Utd for Atalanta's Rasmus Hojlund,"Jul 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-bid-rival-man-utd-rasmus-hojlund,"United, who Erik ten Hag says are ""working 24/7"" to sign a striker, have settled on the 20-year-old Dane as their top target this summer and made a higher offer than PSG's on Wednesday, worth Â£51.4m inclusive of add-ons. Hojlund has already indicated to Atalanta that he wants the opportunity to join United, and that stance has been reaffirmed by his camp to the Red Devils - they are his first choice destination and he hopes a fee will be agreed. PSG's interest stems from their need to plan for life without Kylian Mbappe. The Frenchman is on the shopping list of Saudi Pro League moneybags Al Hilal, and they have even had a world record Â£259m offer accepted. The 24-year-old is not interested in negotiating terms though, and instead wants to join Real Madrid. Sources have confirmed to 90min that PSG's opening offer for Hojlund is a verbal one worth â¬50m in local currency, but it is unlikely to be accepted as Atalanta have already indicated that at least â¬70m will be requited to part ways this summer. feed Club officials have even publicly valued Hojlund at â¬100m, though there's a realisation that neither United or PSG, or any other club for that matter, would be prepared to pay that amount. It's also unclear whether or not PSG will look to further their interest in Hojlund if Atalanta knock their bid back, as they are also known to be pursuing Benfica striker Goncalo Ramos. Luis Enrique's first summer in the French capital has already been a busy one, with turnover high at PSG both in terms of incomings and outgoings. Milan Skriniar, Marco Asensio, Manuel Ugarte, Lee Kang-in and Lucas Hernandez are five high-profile players to have arrived at the club this summer, compensating for the exits of Lionel Messi and Sergio Ramos among others."
Liverpool to make improved offer worth Â£45m for Romeo Lavia,"Jul 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-to-make-improved-offer-45m-romeo-lavia,"Jurgen Klopp's midfield is undergoing a significant revamp after last season's disappointment of missing out on the Champions League, with Naby Keita, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and James Milner already out of the exit door. Fabinho and Jordan Henderson are to follow, with deals to Saudi Pro League sides Al Ittihad and Al Ettifaq working towards completion. There had been doubts over whether Fabinho's switch to Saudi Arabia would go through, with Liverpool struggling to agree the specifics of the Â£40m deal, but work is continuing to make that deal happen. Henderson, meanwhile, has already begun training with his new side and posted a farewell message to Liverpool's supporters on Wednesday. 90min previously revealed that an opening offer for Lavia, comprising of Â£35m plus add-ons, had been rejected by Southampton, with the recently-relegated side looking to pocket a fee of at least Â£50m for the talented teenager. Arsenal and Chelsea have also shown interest in Lavia this summer, while Manchester City have a buy-back clause - inserted in the deal that saw the Belgian join Southampton - that becomes active next summer. feed But Liverpool want to ensure Lavia moves to Anfield and not anywhere else, with sources confirming to 90min that a second bid is expected to imminently land in the St Mary's in tray. The proposal will be worth Â£45m to Southampton overall, comprised of Â£40m in guaranteed money plus an additional Â£5m in add-ons - an amount that still falls short of the Championship side's valuation. Lavia's camp have already indicated their desire to make the move, and 90min understands that personal terms have already been agreed in principle. The hope from Liverpool's end is that a deal can be agreed in time for him to be a part of their pre-season tour to Singapore, which comes to an end next Wednesday. Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai have arrived to help fill the void in midfield, but Klopp's number one priority is to find a new defensive-minded player of holding things together in the middle of the park."
Erik ten Hag: Man Utd working 24/7 to sign a new striker,"Jul 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/erik-ten-hag-man-utd-working-24-7-to-sign-a-new-striker,"The Red Devils' need for additional firepower was laid bare during Wednesday night's 2-0 defeat to Real Madrid at the NRG Stadium in Houston - a game that saw Jude Bellingham get on the scoresheet for the first time since his big-money move from Borussia Dortmund. Marcus Rashford started the game as United's central striker, away from his preferred position out on the left, and he struggled to make an impression as Madrid came away with a well-deserved clean sheet. 90min revealed on Wednesday that United have made an offer worth Â£51.4m for Atalanta striker Rasmus Hojlund, with the Dane identified as Ten Hag's primary target after months and months of scouting. Atalanta are expected to turn the bid down, as they push for an initial fee closer to Â£60m, but Ten Hag admitted in his post-match interview the need for United to bring a fresh face in through the door, and quickly. ""We are working 24-7,"" the Dutchman said of the situation. ""We do and everyone, well not everyone, but a lot in the club, and we give all the power to get this done. We never talk about players under contract with another club, so we have our targets in the background. We are busy with it to get the right player to sign a contract for us."" feed Ten Hag also touched on the nature of Kobbie Mainoo's injury, after he hobbled off in the early stages of the game after being on the receiving end of a crunching Rodrygo tackle. The 18-year-old was pictured wearing a protective boot after the game, but the manager said it was too early to determine the severity of the problem. ""I understand the question,"" Ten Hag said, when asked about his condition. ""But you can never tell straight after a game. We have to wait for what it is. ""So, hopefully, it's not too bad and then chances will come. I wanted to see what levels he could play. Against Arsenal, we were pleased with his performance. I wanted to see if he could repeat that, some days after, from then, we would have conclusions. First, we have to wait for the diagnosis and, from there on, we will set conclusions."" Ten Hag also commented on Andre Onana's debut performance in goal. The former Inter stopper was a late arrival to United's pre-season tour of the United States, but was handed his first opportunity to impress against a side more than capable of keeping him busy. On the whole, Ten Hag was impressed with what he saw from Onana, telling the assembled media:  ""When you play against Real Madrid, you will concede chances because it is a very good team with very good football players. But, overall, we did quite well and in the moment we conceded chances, he was there. I think everyone has seen, he has made a good debut. ""We have a lot of work to do betweenÂ him and and the defending part. You could see the second goal where we are not closing the back post, it can't be that and a goal will come there and that's things that are the rules we have to follow. It will come quickly that we integrate that into our way of play."""

Kylian Mbappe makes his decision over Al Hilal negotiations,"Jul 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/kylian-mbappe-makes-decision-al-hilal-negotiations,"The Saudi Pro League side had a world record â¬300m (Â£259m) offer accepted by PSG on Monday, with the Ligue 1 giants keen to move Mbappe on to avoid losing him on a free transfer next summer. Mbappe has already indicated that he will not exercise the 12-month option in his PSG contract, leaving the club no choice but to try and engineer a transfer for the 24-year-old before the 1 September transfer deadline. PSG had made the 2022 World Cup Golden Boot winner available for â¬200m (Â£171m), hoping long-term admirers Real Madrid would come forward with an offer. But 90min revealed on Monday that it was PIF-backed Al Hilal who had lodged an astronomical bid far above that asking price. Yet doubts quickly emerged over whether Mbappe would be interested in negotiating with Al Hilal, given his long-held affection for Real Madrid, as well as his positive relationship with president Florentino Perez. Sources have now confirmed to 90min that Mbappe and his mother, who is also his agent, have informed a delegation from Al Hilal that they have no interest in discussing personal terms - despite the Saudi club's willingness to make him one of the highest-paid athletes in the world - and have 'zero interest' in leaving Europe at this time. manual Indeed, Mbappe plans to play at the highest level for as many years as he can, which would seemingly rule out a move to the Middle East for the foreseeable future. Whether or not he ends up playing in Saudi Arabia late on in his career remains to be seen, but for now he intends to establish his legacy at a more competitive level. Real Madrid have kept their counsel to this point, unflustered by Al Hilal's approach for Mbappe, though they could still look to tempt PSG to sell this summer for a reduced price. If they decide to wait, the 14-time Champions League winners know they can agree to sign Mbappe on a pre-contract agreement in January, or haggle his price down further when just six months will be left on his PSG deal. PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi is keen to avoid that situation at all costs, with intermediaries instructed to drum up interest in Mbappe from the rest of European football's top brass. But given the finances involved in the deal, coupled with the player's particular desire to head to Madrid, any bid from an interested party may prove futile. While Mbappe is not planning to head to Saudi Arabia, the same can't be said for his PSG team-mate, Marco Verratti. 90min understands that Al Hilal are on the verge of luring the Italian midfielder to Riyadh, where a lucrative three-year contract is on the table. If Verratti joins, as is now expected, he'll line up alongside Ruben Neves and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic in a formidable-looking midfield three. Al Hilal have additionally already signed Kalidou Koulibaly from Chelsea to strengthen their backline."

Among the issues were the treatment of teammates and good friends Neymar and Mbappe, playing a part in deciding the time has to move on from Parc des Princes. New PSG boss Luis Enrique is understood to be a huge fan of Verratti and wanted to keep him. Instead, the club will go on without a player who first joined aged 19 in 2012, with Verratti set to complement an impressive Al Hilal midfield alongside Ruben Neves and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic."
Jordan Henderson posts farewell to Liverpool ahead of Al Ettifaq transfer,"Jul 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jordan-henderson-farewell-liverpool-ahead-al-ettifaq-transfer,"Henderson leaves Liverpool after 12 years, including the last eight as captain, and is set to earn a multi-million pound fortune as a result of a lucrative contract thought to be worth as much as Â£100,000 per day in the Saudi Pro League. The transfer has drawn massive criticism, with Henderson taking his career to a country where homosexuality is illegal, despite having previously been a vocal supporter of LGBTQ+ causes. It more than trebles the Â£190,000 per week contract he had at Liverpool and is set to make an already extremely rich man vastly more wealthy. The use of âlife-changingâ in some of the reporting on his new deal in Saudi Arabia has also been heavily criticised amid a cost of living crisis in the UK. Prior to his farewell message being posted on social media, Henderson had already started training with Al Ettifaq, managed by ex-Liverpool teammate Steven Gerrard, having travelled to the clubâs ongoing summer training camp in Croatia. manual ""I need to somehow put into words what these last 12 years have meant for me and my family,"" was how he began the video, sat in the Anfield dressing room for the 'last time'. ""It was hard leaving [Sunderland], my home town, my club. But when Liverpool come knocking, you don't say no. When I see the footage back now, I'm just a kid. Who would ever have imagined that night how the next 12 years would go?"" he said. ""I can't lie, there have been hard timesâ¦really hard times. But when I look back at my career at Liverpool, it will always be the good times that I remember. ""Being made captain of Liverpool Football Club was one of the greatest honours of my life. From the day the armband was passed to me, I did everything I could to behave like a Liverpool captain should. But the biggest honours at Liverpool weren't personal ones, they were collective â all of us [the players], all of you [the fans], together."" A post shared by Jordan Henderson (@jordanhenderson) Henderson went on to say there is 'no doubt' that Liverpool fans are the 'best in the world' and also declared Anfield to be 'the most special place in the world to play football'. Directly addressing supporters, he finished by saying, ""Thank you for allowing me to be part of your club, for your support in good times and bad. I will always be a red, until the day I die."" Henderson played close to 500 games for Liverpool following his 2011 transfer just over a week before his 21st birthday. He went on to captain the Reds to Champions League glory in 2019, as well as lifting the club's first league title in 30 years in 2020. Domestic cups followed in 2022, while Liverpool played in two further Champions League finals â 2018 and 2022."
Man Utd make offer worth Â£51.4m for Atalanta's Rasmus Hojlund,"Jul 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-make-offer-worth-60m-rasmus-hojlund,"United's offer is worth â¬50m (Â£42.8m, $55.4m) plus an additional â¬10m (Â£8.6m, $11m) in add-ons, though it's understood to fall short of the Italian club's valuation of the 20-year-old. Talks are ongoing between the two clubs at present and United are pushing to get the deal done by the start of August in order to integrate Hojlund with his potential new teammates before the start of the 2023/24 campaign. The offer has not been rejected out of hand, but United are now prepared to go higher if necessary and some ground will likely need to be made up to reach a price closer to Atalanta's valuation - understood to be â¬70m (Â£59.9m, $77.5m). feed United have agreed personal terms in principle with Hojlund and the player wants the move, citing himself previously as a United fan. There is understood to be optimism that a deal will eventually be reached, with the two clubs in talks for a number of months. The Red Devils have already strengthened Erik ten Hag's squad with the captures of goalkeeper Andre Onana and midfielder Mason Mount, while Jonny Evans has returned to the club on a short-term deal to provide pre-season cover in defence. Marcus Rashford recently signed a new five-year contract in a further boost to United, with the 25-year-old looking to build on a career-best season that saw him score 30 goals in all competitions."
Milan summer signing reveals receiving late Barcelona approach,"Jul 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/milan-summer-signing-reveals-receiving-late-barcelona-approach,"The Rossoneri are reinvesting the money made through the sale of Sandro Tonali to Newcastle United, bringing in six senior players since the opening of the transfer window.

Noah Okafor recently seal his move from Red Bull Salzburg, joining Reijnders following his arrival from AZ Alkmaar.

""It was impossible for me - no way, as I already decided to join AC Milan. ""I had made my choice.

West Ham's transfer strategy: What is going on?,"Jul 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-transfer-strategy-what-is-going-on,"The 24-year-old, less than two months after lifting the Europa Conference League trophy above his head, departed for London rivals Arsenal in a deal that will eventually pocket West Ham a British-record Â£105m. It's a fantastic move for Rice on the surface, assuming Arsenal's performances on the field mirror what they've seemingly achieved in the transfer market, but also a fantastic deal for West Ham, who had known for a long time that their captain was destined to move on in a bid to further his career. One would assume that with the influx of cash at West Ham, coupled with Europa League football once again being on offer, that prospective signings would be queueing up outside London Stadium looking to pull on claret and blue each and every week in front of 60,000+ supporters.  But as is so often the case with business at West Ham, things aren't quite that simple.  By this point in last year's summer transfer window, Nayef Aguerd, Alphonse Areola, Flynn Downes had already arrived, while Gianluca Scamacca was being unveiled as the club's fourth major signing of the window. Four further new faces followed, including Lucas Paqueta, and West Ham finished the window as one of the biggest spenders in Europe. Fast forward 12 months and, with a European trophy under their belt and the club's reputation higher than ever, just one player has arrived at West Ham. That one player is a 17-year-old winger from Cliftonville, Sean Moore, who in all likelihood won't be anywhere near the first team squad this season.  Worryingly, the Premier League season starts in 17 days at the time of writing. So what's going on? Wednesday 7 June, 2023 is a date that West Ham supporters around the world will remember forever. A night when the club ended a 43-year trophy drought, beating Fiorentina in the Europa Conference League final in Prague thanks to Jarrod Bowen's dramatic 90th minute winner. Remarkably, that was West Ham's 14th win in the 15 European games played during the season - the 1-1 draw away at Gent in the first leg of their last eight clash the only blemish on the Hammers' otherwise perfect record. That streak is even more remarkable when you consider West Ham's performances in the Premier League. After an incredibly slow start which saw the club lose five of their first seven games, David Moyes quickly adopted survival mode in an attempt to navigate a fixture schedule like no other. Playing every Sunday and Thursday, with domestic cup competitions and a World Cup thrown in for good measure, the volume of games was relentless. Quickly out the window was the notion that West Ham could play a more free-flowing, expansive brand of football, playing to the strengths of marquee signing Paqueta. Instead, it was very apparent that Moyes was doing whatever it took to avoid defeat - West Ham's defensive line getting deeper and deeper with each passing week - and that Michail Antonio would often be taking on a back four all on his own. It meant that West Ham's major signings, Paqueta and Scamacca, were nowhere near as effective as they could have been. The former struggled to impose himself in the early months of the season, acclimatising to the pace of the Premier League, while the latter never really got going at any point during 2022/23 - he even struggled to get into the side before injury struck. After the World Cup, Paqueta began to showcase his quality, stamping his authority on games more and more, and he was soon one of West Ham's most consistent performers. But the results still didn't come in the Premier League. The final day 2-1 defeat to Leicester City, who themselves endured a shocking season to go down, was the 20th time the Hammers, who ended up finishing 14th, had come away from a game with nothing. The 20th time. It's no surprise then that David Sullivan, regardless of West Ham's achievements in Europe, was pretty underwhelmed by what he'd seen. Paqueta, with a splash of Emerson, Aguerd, Areola and Thilo Kehrer thrown in, had been the only incoming to really, really impress, with Moyes' position as manager considered on a number of occasions. The Scot's dealings in the market, led alongside head of recruitment Rob Newman, were under the microscope, with Sullivan seemingly unwilling to make the same mistakes again this time around. The decision was eventually taken to hire a technical director tasked with overseeing the club's player recruitment strategy and scouting, and the successful candidate was Tim Steidten, formerly of Werder Bremen and Bayer Leverkusen. Serge Gnabry, Kevin De Bruyne (on loan) and Thomas Delaney are three premier examples of the profile, and calibre, of player identified by Steidten during his time at Werder Bremen. All three under the age of 22 when signed, clearly gifted and with a high ceiling in terms of potential. Moussa Diaby, Jeremie Frimpong, Edmond Tapsoba and Piero Hincapie four further signings during Steidten's time at Bayer Leverkusen, all of whom fall into a similar mould. It's clear to see that Steidten works towards a particular philosophy and plan. He identifies young players who can come in and change the dynamic of a team not only now but also in the years to come. Players with potentially huge resale value in the future - likely to outgrow the club in all likelihood but extremely coachable and able to adapt to what's being asked of them - and often players bought directly from source. It's a business model that many teams in continental Europe adopt. Red Bull Salzburg in Austria is perhaps the biggest raw talent of pool of the last decade, and it's a way of working that Brighton & Hove Albion have been implementing over the last few years. The club's reputation? Sky rocketing. The club's bank balance? Consistently ticking over. The club's cohesion in terms of recruitment? Faultless. West Ham could do a lot worse than the players Steidten is identifying, particularly as they all indicate pulling in one direction. Youssouf Fofana, Denis Zakaria, Edson Alvarez, Elye Wahi and the aforementioned Tah are all players the German has recommended as signings - the most expensive of that quintet likely to be Ajax's Alvarez, who was previously of interest to Chelsea and Manchester United and had looked likely to join Borussia Dortmund earlier this summer. Zakaria is the oldest of the five at 26, but the downside from Moyes' point of view is that he is the only player with any Premier League experience. West Ham's manager sees things very differently in terms of what's needed to plug the gap left by Rice, as well as in other positions - he wants players who can slot into the side immediately, understanding the rigours of top flight football in England. At least in Carlos Borges' case, there seems to be willingness from both Moyes and Steidten to do that particular deal. Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher is a player West Ham have been tracking for a long, long time. Young, full of running and very talented with both feet, the 23-year-old has a number of desirable attributes, and is a regular in Gareth Southgate's England squad. The issue for West Ham here, and other interested parties, is Gallagher's price. The Hammers verbally indicated they would be prepared to pay Â£40m to Chelsea, inclusive of bonuses, but that figure falls some way short of what the Blues want. It's a similar story over at Fulham, with two West Ham bids for Joao Palhinha, a player who is 28, turned down - the second of which 90min understands was worth Â£50m. Scott McTominay, Harry Maguire, James Ward-Prowse are three further players identified by Moyes this summer, all of whom have an abundance of Premier League football under their belt and would probably expect to be starters. But with a premium price point applied for playing in England, none of the three will come cheap. Most importantly, they appear to conflict with Steidten's long-term vision for the club - they don't really carry any resale value and, in truth, are unlikely to improve as footballers. Gallagher perhaps bucks the trend in terms of his current ability and potential, but coming close to Chelsea's asking price would significantly dent the Hammers' budget. Steidten's targets, with the exception of Alvarez, are probably attainable for half of that price and that's where the issue lies. The end result is West Ham are not as far forward as they should be this summer. With two-and-a-half weeks of the season to go, central midfield is an area of real concern and any new signing will need to slot straight into the side. That points towards West Ham heading in the direction of Moyes' preferred targets, as avoiding a slow start will be a high priority. Verbal enquiries and offers have been put in for close to a dozen players, yet nothing concrete has been put forward. Seemingly, there's no overarching agreement of what West Ham need, so instead it's a feeling out process to gauge the feel of the market. Ultimately, the Hammers may end up alienating either Moyes or Steidten, making a long-term co-operation between the pair less and less likely. The only certainty right now is that the pressure is on West Ham to spend - they must decide on what direction they are going in and they must do it quickly."
Mauricio Pochettino responds to Chelsea links to Kylian Mbappe,"Jul 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/mauricio-pochettino-responds-chelsea-links-kylian-mbappe,"Paris Saint-Germain are looking to sell Mbappe this summer after he informed them he would not be extending his contract beyond 2024. 90min understands that Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal have had a world-record Â£259m bid for the forward accepted by PSG, though he will need convincing in order to leave Europe despite the offer of a lucrative contract.

""It shows that Pep appreciates the player. We have a certain interest in him,"" said Hainer. ""We have to see how that will develop in the next few weeks. We still have some time in the transfer window.""

Levy met Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen earlier in July, though the Spurs chairman gave no indication or suggestion that Kane would be sold.

Five potential free transfer targets for Barcelona with links to Xavi,"Jul 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/five-potential-free-transfer-targets-barcelona-links-xavi,"Scattergun would be harsh, but pinpointing a particular strategy is tricky. Xavi, however, has helped cultivate a winning team, even if they've struggled in Europe thus far. The club's financial woes have ensured the former BarÃ§a midfielder hasn't had it easy on the recruitment front. Still, some savvy lever-pulling last summer facilitated a La Liga title in 2022/23 as Robert Lewandowski and Jules Kounde both played vital roles in the club's triumph.  BarÃ§a are again working on a shoestring budget this summer as they attempt to assert themselves at the summit of Spanish football once more. The free agent market is one they might have to dabble in as the window wears on, and here are a few familiar options for Xavi to consider.  Some might label it insanity if Barcelona go back in for former academy graduate Adama Traore following his underwhelming loan spell in 2022.  Unstoppable on his day, Traore's inconsistency and technical limitations have deterred many clubs from ever making a move to sign the Spanish international. BarÃ§a did take the plunge midway through the 2021/22 campaign when Xavi was at the helm, but he was quickly ostracised despite a bright enough start to his loan spell.  The club unsurprisingly opted against buying Traore permanently at the end of the season, but hey, he's available again, folks! Round three?  Cut from the same cloth as other great Spanish number tens of his generation, Isco enjoyed his peak years in the capital as opposed to Catalonia. Thus, Isco never combined with Xavi at club level, but their international careers did just about intertwine. Isco's senior debut arrived in 2013, a year before Xavi called it quits with La Roja. The former Barcelona midfielder wasn't in the squad when Isco made his debut against Uruguay in a friendly, and the two never actually featured alongside one another despite being named in several Spain squads together.  While Isco enjoyed great collective success at Real Madrid, he didn't quite live up to his early projections as a youngster. He left Los Blancos in 2022 and spent last season at Sevilla, but he's now without a club and it's unclear just how long he's got left at the highest level. Xavi's elegance and Sergio Ramos' robust aggression came to define the great ideological duel between Spain's two behemoths when Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola were marauding the Clasico touchline.  The two were perhaps never the best of friends given how entrenched each were in their respective club's ideals, but there's no doubting the underlying respect they had for one another. They met countless times during what was for a period the fiercest duel European football had to offer.  Xavi often hit out at Real's agricultural antics, of which Ramos was a staunch defender. Nevertheless, the pair seemed to put their club allegiances aside when representing the national team. Together, Ramos and Xavi won two European Championships and the 2010 World Cup as Spain emerged as the planet's footballing Mecca.  Ramos, who is six years Xavi's junior, is on the market after a two-year spell in Paris. A move to Barcelona is near-impossible, but the fantasy is Hollywood-worthy. Alexis spent three years at Barcelona with Xavi before moving to the Premier League in 2014. The Chilean dazzled without ever being regarded as a protagonist in Catalonia, and it wasn't until he signed for Arsenal that Alexis' reputation soared. The creative, but also prolific, forward reached superstardom in north London, with the current BarÃ§a boss labelling his former teammate as âone of the best attacking players in the worldâ while he was tearing it up at Arsenal. An ill-fated move to Man Utd damaged Alexis' reputation somewhat, but while he's since failed to reach the highs of his Arsenal stint, the Chilean legend proved more than serviceable for Antonio Conte at Inter before enjoying a fine season with Marseille in Ligue 1.  Now 34 and without a club, could the veteran enjoy one last hurrah in Catalonia? While one half of Barcelona's greatest midfield duo is calling the shots at Camp Nou these days, the other is determined to keep playing following his departure from Vissel Kobe. Andres Iniesta, now 39, epitomised Barcelona and is perhaps the only person on the planet who will understand Xavi's methods as well as the boss himself. His legs are likely gone but Iniesta's mind is still sharper than almost anyone on the planet. Xavi and Iniesta pulled the strings in Barcelona's midfield in front of Sergio Busquets, and it looks like a reunion with the latter could be on the cards as Iniesta is of interest to Major League Soccer's Inter Miami, but a return to Catalonia would be just as fascinating."
Fabinho's proposed Saudi Pro League switch in doubt,"Jul 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/fabinho-saudi-pro-league-switch-doubt,"The 29-year-old, who still has three years left on his Anfield contract, was previously given permission to undergo a medical with the Saudi champions, before potentially linking up with Karim Benzema and N'Golo Kante at a club managed by former Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo. But despite both teams working towards a deal being finalised, the process has slowed down as Liverpool have not yet agreed the details of when certain amounts of the fee will be paid. 90min understands there's a willingness from Liverpool and Al Ittihad to work through the issue, but the Brazilian will, unexpectedly, return to training at the Reds' AXA Training Centre until an agreement can be found. Liverpool have already begun to plan for life after Fabinho and team-mate Jordan Henderson, who is also expected to head to Saudi Arabia in order to link up with former team-mate Steven Gerrard, now in charge of Al Ettifaq. The Reds have seen an opening offer for Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia rejected, though it's understood the club will return with an improved bid worth more than the Â£35m plus add-ons package they initially proposed. feed 19-year-old Lavia is more geared towards replacing Fabinho than Henderson, after starring in a defensive midfield role last season despite Southampton's relegation from the Premier League, and is valued by the Saints at over Â£50m. The Belgian is also on the radar of Arsenal and Chelsea, both of whom have admired the Belgian for a long time and could yet make moves of their own. Speaking recently to Liverpool's official club podcast, Jurgen Klopp recently said of his preparations for the new season and prospective new signings: ""My main focus and my main energy has to go into the training sessions, that's what I do,"" he told Liverpool's official club podcast. ""The time left and right of the sessions then I can try and sort other stuff, and that's what we are doing. ""Still around three to four weeks until the first game of the season, a few things have to happen until then. Definitely. Transfer market-wise as well, that's clear now. It will happen, and we will have a good team."" Liverpool have already drafted in Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai from Brighton & Hove Albion and RB Leipzig respectively, after letting a number of experienced midfielders leave the club. Naby Keita, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and James Milner have departed on free transfers, with Fabinho and Henderson's proposed exits indicating a significant changing of the guard for Liverpool in the centre of the park."
Liverpool see first offer for relegated Southampton star rejected,"Jul 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-first-offer-southampton-star-rejected,"The Reds have already brought in Alexis Mac Allister from Brighton & Hove Albion and Dominik Szoboszlai from RB Leipzig this summer, but they are looking to conduct further business in the transfer market. 90min revealed earlier in July that Liverpool were set to battle it out with Arsenal and Chelsea for Southampton star Lavia, with the need for further reinforcements heightened by the potential sales of Fabinho and Jordan Henderson. The former's proposed move to Al Ittihad has hit a temporary snag, as the clubs negotiate the make-up of the Â£40m deal and when payments will be made, but Henderson looks on course to join former team-mate Steven Gerrard at Al Ettifaq, earning a bumper pay day in the process. Sources close to Southampton have now confirmed to 90min that a bid from Liverpool for Lavia, worth Â£35m plus add-ons, has been rejected, with the offer described as 'miles away' from the club's valuation. feed Indeed, it's believed Southampton are looking for at least Â£50m for 19-year-old Lavia, who impressed greatly last season despite the club's relegation to the Championship. Southampton are not in a rush to sell Lavia - knowing they could generate income from selling captain James Ward-Prowse - and are happy to keep him at St Mary's if Liverpool, or any other interested party, fail to meet their valuation. Lavia joined the Saints last summer from Manchester City having only played two games at senior level before, but quickly emerged as one of Europe's finest young midfielders during his first year on the south coast.  City retain a buy-back clause worth Â£40m which will become active next summer if he is still at Southampton, while Arsenal and Chelsea remain interested in Lavia and are keeping apprised of developments. Manchester United and Newcastle had previously touched base too, but they have not made contact recently and are looking at other targets."
Manchester City inform Bernardo Silva of transfer decision,"Jul 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/manchester-city-inform-bernardo-silva-transfer-decision,"Silva informed City last summer that he wanted to play elsewhere as he courted interest from Barcelon. But a deal did not materialise as the club told him to stay for at least another season. The former Monaco starman did indeed stay and enjoyed another outstanding campaign for the Cityzens as they completed an historic Treble. However, Silva has again made it clear through his representatives that he would like the chance to move and has attracted considerable interest. Silva has little interest in an offer on the table from Saudi Arabia to join Al-Hilal, despite the lucrative nature of the contract. However, there is also strong interest from long-term suitors Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain, both of whom he is keen to talk to and explore a deal. Barcelona would love to sign Silva and sources have confirmed to 90min that they already would have done by now if they had the money available. But while they remain interested, the chances of the Catalans being able to put together a deal acceptable to City appears remote at this stage. feed Then there is PSG. New head coach Luis Enrique has made it clear to his bosses that he wants Silva and the club's football advisor, Luis Campos, has already held talks with both Silva and City. They have informed their European champions they would be willing to meet their asking price, believed to be around Â£75m. But that still may not be enough to get a deal done. The talks with City have not progressed and the English side have held their own conversations with Silva. The message they are making clear is that they can't afford to lose him this summer. Pep Guardiola rarely likes to keep any player who wants to leave and has a history of letting them go - Leroy Sane, Gabriel Jesus, Raheem Sterling and most recently Riyad Mahrez, to name examples. But Silva's case is set to be different and Guardiola is adamant he does not want to see him move on, especially given the sale of Mahrez and the earlier loss of club captain Ilkay Gundogan. They have already brought in Mateo Kovavic from Chelsea, but the belief is that Silva is too hard to replace.  90min understands that City have looked around at other midfield options, with Bayern Munich's Joshua Kimmich, Inter's Nicolo Barella and Bayer Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz amongst those they have done work on. But neither looks to be available and it makes the need to keep Silva more pressing. To try and smooth things over with Silva, sources have told 90min that City are prepared to offer him one of the biggest deals in their history and put him in the same bracket as the likes of Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne. Officials hope that sort of offer could demonstrate his importance to the club and persuade him to stay. Silva's current deal is due to run until 2025, which puts City in a strong position as they don't need to sell, but still want to reward him if he does stay."
Chelsea open to Conor Gallagher sale but firm on valuation,"Jul 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-open-conor-gallagher-transfer--firm-on-valuation-west-ham-tottenham,"The 23-year-old featured in 35 Premier League games for Chelsea last season, scoring three goals, but failed to command a regular starting place under any of the club's three managers - Thomas Tuchel, Graham Potter or Frank Lampard. The Blues have let an abundance of central midfielders leave this summer as the Mauricio Pochettino era gets underway, with Mason Mount, N'Golo Kante and Mateo Kovacic among those to depart. Ruben Loftus-Cheek has also left Chelsea to join AC Milan, in the hope of earning more regular starting time, both in Serie A and in Europe. Chelsea have shown great interest in signing Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo over the past few months - a player valued by the Seagulls at around Â£100m - and sources have confirmed to 90min that the Blues, despite their lack of options, would be open to letting Gallagher leave were an acceptable offer to come in. feed West Ham United have made an enquiry about Gallagher's potential price tag and have verbally indicated a price they would be willing to pay - 90min understands that reports of a formal Â£40m offer being put in are wide of the mark. Chelsea would be prepared to sell Gallagher if they were to receive an offer around Â£50m, though Pochettino remains open to the player staying at Stamford Bridge to fight for his place. Gallagher for his part is concerned about his opportunities at the club long-term and is willing to explore a move away. London rivals Tottenham are maintaining an interest in Gallagher's situation, while Brighton, who will compete in this season's Europa League, previously held talks over a potential move this summer but were put off by the five-time Premier League champions' valuation. Gallagher is one of a number of players being targeted by West Ham, who have money to spend after persuading Arsenal to part with a British-record Â£105m to sign captain Declan Rice. Scott McTominay and James Ward-Prowse are other homegrown targets of David Moyes, while new technical director Tim Steidten is busy scouring Europe looking for more affordable options."

Erik ten Hag responds to Man Utd links with Kylian Mbappe,"Jul 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/erik-ten-hag-responds-man-utd-links-kylian-mbappe,"Paris Saint-Germain informed Mbappe last Friday that he would not be allowed to travel with the first team for their pre-season tour of Asia as they were looking to sell him before the end of the summer transfer window. The forward previously intimated he would not sign a new contract beyond 2024. PSG accepted a world-record Â£259m bid from Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal on Monday, allowing Mbappe to hold talks over personal terms. While Al Hilal have made their move, a number of clubs have been linked with Mbappe in hope that he would prefer to stay in Europe. United have been touted as a potential destination in recent days and Ten Hag was asked about whether he's interested in Mbappe at a press conference ahead of their pre-season friendly against Real Madrid in Houston. ""We never speak about players who are under contract in other clubs,"" the Dutchman said. manual Though Ten Hag was in no mood to talk about Mbappe, he did insist that United are pressing forward in their search for a new striker, with Atalanta's Rasmus Hojlund agreeing personal terms over a move to Old Trafford. ""What I can say is we do everything that's in our power to get it done,"" he continued. ""For me, as soon as possible, the earlier the better, because we have to integrate him in the team, the way of play. In an ideal situation, he was already here but you do not always get ideal situations as a manager and you have to deal with the situation. ""We make progress, yeah, but we know how it works and when we have him, we will tell you directly. We are underperforming [at goalscoring] and we are aware of it. Others also have to contribute in that area and therefore, also we are looking for goalscoring capabilities.

There's so much news going around it's also not easy for him, but he's captain at the moment and he's working with the team. ""He doesn't show any distraction. He loves being here. I love him as a player. I fully respect him. He's one of the best strikers in the world, has been for five, six, seven years in a row.

Chelsea's chosen destination for Angelo loan revealed,"Jul 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-chosen-destination-angelo-loan-revealed,"The 18-year-old winger signed from Santos for Â£13m earlier this summer having made 129 appearances in all competitions for the Brazilian side, scoring five goals. Angelo was taken on Chelsea's summer tour to the United States and has featured in wins over Brighton and Wrexham in July so far.

Kylian Mbappe: PSG accept world record Â£259m bid from Al Hilal,"Jul 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/breaking-psg-accept-world-record-259m-al-hilal-kylian-mbappe,"The long-term Real Madrid target has been put up for sale by PSG and left out of the pre-season tour of Japan, with the club not prepared to allow Mbappe to wind down his contract in the French capital, which has less than a year to run. Mbappe has already indicated that he will not be exercising the 12-month option to extend, leading PSG to look at selling the 24-year-old this summer before he's able to walk away for free. The Ligue 1 giants had been hoping to garner a fee of around â¬200m (Â£172m) for Mbappe, in the hope that Real Madrid would make a move, but 90min revealed on Monday that Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal - one of four clubs financially backed by the country's Public Investment Fund (PIF) - had entered the running with a gargantuan offer worth â¬300m (Â£259m). Sources have now confirmed to 90min that PSG have, understandably, accepted the offer for Mbappe, with relations between the club and the player seemingly at an all-time low. He now has permission to discuss with Al Hilal a potential move to Saudi Arabia, who have already attracted Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema to the country over the past seven months. A whole host of other big name players - Roberto Firmino, Kalidou Koulibaly and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic among others - have already made the move to cash-rich Saudi this summer, with the enormous wages and bonuses on offer proving too good to turn down. manual 90min understands that Mbappe's camp are yet to respond to the interest from Al Hilal, but the player has previously had his heart set on joining Real Madrid - his relationship with club president Florentino Perez remains unblemished despite a dramatic U-turn that saw Mbappe shun Madrid's advances in 2022 in favour of signing a new PSG contract. Intermediaries working on behalf of PSG are attempting to drive up interest in Mbappe from elsewhere, 90min further understands, though Al Hilal's world record bid - which is close to â¬80m (Â£69m) more than the current transfer record - would be impossible for any side to compete with.  Nevertheless, PSG want to ensure they leave 'no stone unturned' as they prepare to part ways with Mbappe. Real Madrid have kept their cards close to their chest to date, knowing that in six months they can agree to sign Mbappe on a pre-contract agreement, and must now watch on as Al Hilal attempt to persuade him that a move to Saudi Arabia, at least in the short-term, is in his best interests."
Five potential free transfer targets for Manchester United with links to Erik ten Hag,"Jul 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/five-potential-free-transfer-targets-manchester-united-links-erik-ten-hag,"Ten Hag has had less than three full transfer windows at Old Trafford but United have already spent more than Â£150m on players that their Dutch coach has managed in the past. The arrival of former Ajax goalkeeper Andre Onana is merely a continuation of the policy that brought Lisandro Martinez and Antony to the north of England. If United are intent on sticking to the reunion strategy, they may be tempted to dip their toe into the free agent market. Here are some of the free transfers with an all-important link to Ten Hag that last season's League Cup winners could snag this summer. What. A. Moment. ðOne year ago today, Lucas Moura wrote himself into the Tottenham Hotspur history books FOREVER!Football is incredible ð¤¯ pic.twitter.com/qH4c6RsXft ""Football can be very beautiful,"" Ten Hag mused after steering Ajax to their first Champions League semi-final since the 1990s. ""And it can be very cruel."" At half-time of the second leg, Ajax led Tottenham 3-0 on aggregate. Ten Hag warned his players about a possible comeback but could scarcely have predicted Lucas Moura's second-half hat-trick, sealed in the 96th minute, to send Spurs to the final in Madrid. Four years on from that cruel evening, Moura has come to the end of his Tottenham contract, giving Ten Hag the chance to have the Brazilian on his side this time. Despite scoring on his league debut for FC Utrecht after Ten Hag signed him in the summer of 2017, Sander van de Streek enjoyed his best form for the club once his coach had been poached by Ajax mid-season. Across the final 11 games of the 2017/18 campaign, Van de Streek rifled in seven goals (and created another three). The box-crashing midfielder saw out his deal at Utrecht this summer and could be given another chance to show Ten Hag his full value. feed Mark Diemers had been at FC Utrecht for four years but lasted just six months before Ten Hag deemed him surplus to requirements, sending the midfielder on a loan which turned into a free transfer to De Graafschap. When Ten Hag was appointed Manchester United manager, Diemers praised the coach's ""insanely good"" tactical training sessions but warned: ""I just didn't think he was very good at the time on a human level."" However, the pair have fired off sporadic text messages to each other in the intervening years and Diemers stressed: ""He has undoubtedly grown at a human level."" Perhaps one of the next digital exchanges between the pair will involve a contractual offer. Ten Hag hailed Dario Dumic as a ""real killer"" when he signed the centre-back during his final summer as Utrecht manager in 2017. However, the then-25-year-old spent most of his six months under Ten Hag killing time on the substitutes bench. Even after Ten Hag moved to Ajax, Dumic struggled for playing time under his successors at Marco van Basten's boyhood club. After finishing bottom of the German second-tier with SV Sandhausen last season, a jump straight to Manchester United would represent a staggering career arch - especially for a 31-year-old. However, after spending time under Ten Hag's tutelage, Dumic's chances of a transfer to Old Trafford aren't entirely impossible. After steering Go Ahead Eagles to promotion during his first season of senior management, Ten Hag took the seemingly backwards step of coaching Bayern Munich's second team in the German fourth tier. Ten Hag used the two years wisely, soaking in as many secrets as he could prise away from the first team coach Pep Guardiola. When Ten Hag wasn't gawking at the senior side's training sessions, he was overseeing a team that had Patrick Weihrauch at its epicentre. While he made more than 100 appearances for Bayern II, Weihrauch never got a run out for the first team. Now 29, Weihrauch has come to the end of his time with Dynamo Dresden in Germany's third division. A reunion with Weihrauch may even go beyond Ten Hag's iron-clad loyalty."
Could Al Hilal actually sign Kylian Mbappe from PSG?,"Jul 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/could-al-hilal-actually-sign-kylian-mbappe-psg,"Kylian Mbappe's future had seemingly been heading towards a dreary conclusion this summer with a move to Real Madrid inevitable. With Paris Saint-Germain determined to garner a fee for their superstar before his contract expires next year, the Spanish giants were believed to be the only club capable of financing a deal for the Frenchman despite intrigue from the Premier League. Mbappe, meanwhile, has his heart set on the Spanish capital. However, the wealthiest of spanners has been thrown in the works. The financial might of Saudi Arabia and their unrelenting determination for football relevancy has seen Al Hilal table a world-record offer for Mbappe.  Their â¬300m bid has been accepted by PSG, and Mbappe will undoubtedly mull over Al Hilal's mammoth salary offer believed to be worth a staggering â¬700m. Bonkers, right? Absolutely. But, remarkably, it is feasible. Al Hilal could actually pull this off. Well, they wouldn't have made the offer if they couldn't afford it.  At the start of June, the country's ministry of sport revealed that the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF), who own a majority share in Newcastle, will be taking control of four Saudi Pro League clubs - widely regarded as the biggest four in the country: Al Hilal, Al Nassr, Al Ittihad, and Al Ahli. PIF now owns a 75% stake in each of these clubs, essentially topping them up with bottomless pits of cash.  Saudi's PIF retained its status as the sixth largest sovereign wealth fund on the planet earlier this year, with the latest data suggesting it boasts a net worth of $607.42bn. With no financial fair play rules to contend with, there's no questioning that Al Hilal could finance their proposed move for Mbappe, as ludicrous as it seems. Every Saudi Pro League club can register eight foreign players over the course of the season. Right now, Al Hilal's quota is full after they made three big name signings earlier this summer. If Mbappe accepts the club's proposal, Al Hilal will have to ditch one of their five other foreign players. Former West Brom star Matheus Pereira is on their books but spent last season out on loan, while they also boast former Porto forward Moussa Marega, South Korean international Jang Hyun-soo, former Sporting CP winger Andre Carillo and Brazilian striker Michael. The latter seems the most likely candidate for the chop, although Pereira did fall out of favour before his loan move away. The four clubs owned by PIF have all filled their foreign players quota ahead of the new season.  It doesn't appear as if Mbappe's potential move to Saudi Arabia will deny the Frenchman to chance to don Real Madrid colours in 2024.  While agreeing to sign for Al Hilal will obviously prevent him from joining this summer, Mbappe could sign a one-year deal with the Saudi Pro League club and move to Los Blancos on a free transfer next summer.  While there are multiple European clubs supposedly interested in signing Mbappe either this summer or next, including Barcelona, Mbappe has his heart set on a move to the Spanish capital. It's just a matter of when the move will happen, and how much richer he'll be by the time he ends up at the Bernabeu. Player Signed from Fee Ruben Neves Wolves â¬55m Sergej Milinkovic-Savic Lazio â¬40m Kalidou Koulibaly Chelsea â¬23m Al Hilal have parted ways with three foreign players to facilitate these moves. Luciano Vietto and Odion Ighalo departed as free agents, while Gustavo Cueller was sold to Al Shabab. Saudi clubs had previously targeted ageing superstars before Al Hilal acquired Ruben Neves from Wolves in a deal worth â¬55m. He'll be joined in midfield by Lazio icon Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, who eventually left the Eternal City in favour of the riches in the Middle East.  Chelsea happily handed Kalidou Koulibaly to the Saudi club following one bleak year at Stamford Bridge, letting him leave for less than what they brought him for last summer. "

Al Hilal make world record offer for Kylian Mbappe,"Jul 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/al-hilal-make-world-record-offer-kylian-mbappe,"Mbappe was left out of PSG's pre-season squad after making it clear that he does intend to trigger the extension clause in his current contract, which runs until the summer of 2024. The Ligue 1 champions are desperate to avoid a situation where Mbappe can leave the club on a free transfer, and have made available him this summer. Contact has been made with a number of clubs across the globe, but it's shock interest from Saudi Arabia that could rock the footballing world. Sources have confirmed to 90min that PIF-backed Al Hilal have formalised an enormous offer worth â¬300m (Â£259m) that would make Mbappe the most expensive player ever - a fee that would shatter the record set by PSG's acquisition of Neymar for â¬222m (Â£198m) in 2017. PSG are prepared to accept the offer but the final decision will ultimately rest with Mbappe, who 90min understands is not keen on a move to the Middle East at this point in his career. feed Indeed, sources close to the Saudi side acknowledge that their proposal is unlikely to be approved by Mbappe who, as 90min revealed earlier this week, has his heart solely set on a move to Real Madrid in the future. Real Madrid's long-term interest in Mbappe remains and club president Florentino Perez is confident of having the Frenchman in his squad by 2024, when Mbappe will become a free agent if he does not sign an extension. A summer transfer to the Santiago Bernabeu has not been ruled out but Real Madrid are reluctant to pay a significant fee for a player who can be secured on a free transfer in just six months. PSG, while also leaving the door open to a contract extension for Mbappe, are looking to drum up interest in the 24-year-old from elsewhere in Europe in the hope of seeing clubs match their asking price of at least â¬200m (Â£172m)."
Man Utd poach Darren Fletcher's sons from Man City,"Jul 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-poach-darren-fletcher-sons-man-city,"Fletcher was himself a United youth product, moving to Manchester from Scotland aged 11 tin 1995 to follow in the footsteps of players like Paul Scholes and David Beckham. He eventually left Old Trafford in 2015 after illness took its toll on his playing career at the very highest level, but stayed local to the area through spells with West Brom and Stoke, and returned to the club as a youth team coach in the autumn of 2020. Fletcher was promoted to first-team coach in early 2021, working alongside former teammate Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He was then appointed technical director just two months later. feed But despite Fletcherâs long association with United, his twin sons â Jack and Tyler, born in 2007 and recently turning 16, have been Manchester City academy players since their dad was walking out onto the Old Trafford turf each week. That is not actually unusual. The sons of Phil Neville, Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie have all played in Cityâs youth teams, although Harvey Neville did join United prior to going pro with Inter Miami, while Kai Rooney is currently tearing it up in a red shirt instead. In addition to Jack and Tyler Fletcher moving to United, 90min understands that the proposed deal to take academy prospect Harrison Parker in the opposite direction is also going through. The twins are due to turn 17 next March, at which point they will be able to sign professional terms with United. Jack and Tyler curiously represent different international sides. Jack has played for England at youth level, but Tyler has instead turned out for Scotland through his fatherâs heritage. They actually played against each other in an Under-16 game in February this year."
Kieran Tierney discusses Arsenal future amid Celtic links,"Jul 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/kieran-tierney-discusses-arsenal-future-celtic-links,"Tierney was a high profile arrival in 2019 when he completed a Â£25m switch from Celtic. But injuries and then increased competition following last summer's capture of Oleksandr Zinchenko have forced the Scotland international into more of a back-up or rotational role. Noting his lack of regular starts, a number of clubs have already shown interest in the player. 90min reported in March that Newcastle, West Ham and Aston Villa were monitoriing his situation. Brendan Rodgers, now back at Celtic, is also a big admirer, while had been interested prior to their relegation. But even potentially now the fourth choice left-back behind Zinchenko, Jakub Kiwior and Takehiro Tomiyasu, Tierney is willing to fight for regular playing time.  ""It's not really up to me [my future],"" Tierney said to media during Arsenal's pre-season tour.  ""I'm happy, I'm working hard every day and getting minutes. I'm just trying to do as well as I can."" feed When asked if he'd held conversations with Arteta regarding his future, the 26-year-old said: ""No. You can't play every single game, every single season, every single year. I don't expect that and I still made a lot of appearances last year. I was ready every game and working 100 per cent. I think everyone in there would agree with that, that I never give less than that whether I'm playing or not. ""In the games I did play I tried to do my best for the team. I came off the bench a lot last season, whether that was to see games out or help get a goal."" The return of the aforementioned Rodgers to Celtic has raised the possibility of a reunion in Glasgow. Rodgers previously played a huge role in Tierney's development during his first spell at Parkhead and hasn't ruled out the idea of working together again. ""There's been lots of players linked with here with me coming back. All I know is Kieran is like myself, we loved our time here,"" he said. ""When I spoke to him down the road in the Premier League, every time we met up all we talked about was Celtic. He's a Celtic man but he's at a fantastic club in Arsenal."""
Al Hilal closing in on Aleksandar Mitrovic agreement with Fulham,"Jul 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/al-hilal-closing-in-on-aleksandar-mitrovic-agreement-with-fulham,"Fulham have already knocked back two bids from Al Hilal for Mitrovic and had hoped to keep hold of the Serbian striker, who agreed personal terms with the Middle Eastern outfit weeks ago and is keen to make the move. Having seen an offer of Â£30m turned down, Al Hilal are now understood to have lodged a bid worth Â£50m which, as it stands, would represent a record for the Saudi Pro League. Discussions are ongoing between the two clubs and an agreement is close to being reached. Fulham have been preparing for the departure of Mitrovic and have already struck an agreement to sign Wolves' Raul Jimenez in his place. feed Fulham have already managed to fend off Saudi Arabian interest in manager Marco Silva, who has rejected an approach from Al Ahli and voiced his desire to keep hold of Mitrovic after the pre-season friendly against Brentford. ""Of course, if Mitrovic is my player I would like him to train, to be involved in all the moments with the team,"" Silva said. ""You know that, that I would like to have him participating in all the moments with the team."" With Mitrovic closing in on an exit, Fulham are also battling to keep hold of midfielder Joao Palhinha, who has been the subject of significant interest from West Ham. The Hammers, blessed with the Â£105m they received from selling Declan Rice to Arsenal, have seen two bids knocked back for Palhinha, the latest of which was worth Â£50m. Fulham want closer to Â£60m to offload the midfield enforcer. Elsewhere, Fulham have held talks with Chelsea over signing wantaway winger Callum Hudson-Odoi, who also has interest from Lazio."
Fulham & Lazio battling for Chelsea's Callum Hudson-Odoi,"Jul 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/fulham-lazio-battling-callum-hudson-odoi-chelsea,"Hudson-Odoi was left out of Chelsea's pre-season squad to continue negotiations over a move away from his boyhood club, with everyone involved ready to part ways with summer. The winger has attracted interest from across the globe but sources have confirmed to 90min that Lazio and Fulham have both ramped up conversations with Hudson-Odoi to try and get a deal done. Lazio attempted to steal an early march on proceedings by reaching out to the player at a time when Fulham's transfer plans were in limbo due to uncertainty surrounding manager Marco Silva, whose decision to reject Saudi Arabian side Al Ahli has now allowed the Cottagers to focus on new signings. The Serie A side are led by former Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri, who is keen on a reunion with Hudson-Odoi and can offer the 22-year-old the chance to play in the Champions League. feed Fulham, however, hope that the chance to remain in London will help them convince Hudson-Odoi to make the short trip from Stamford Bridge to Craven Cottage. With Silva now confirmed in place, Fulham have accelerated talks with Hudson-Odoi, who has managed 126 appearances for Chelsea since first making his debut during the 2017/18 campaign, and are pushing to get a deal done. Hudson-Odoi's entourage have also been spoken to by Crystal Palace but the Eagles have not advanced their interest at this point. Talks with Palace are completely separate to any negotiations over Frenchman Michael Olise, who has been earmarked for a return to Stamford Bridge this summer."

Tottenham owner makes decision on Harry Kane's future,"Jul 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-owner-makes-decision-harry-kane-future,"Levy, who is employed by Lewis's ENIC Group to run Spurs, has been playing hardball with Kane in that he has not been willing to entertain any interest in his captain. However, Bahamas-based Lewis has made it clear to Levy that allowing Kane to leave on a free transfer in 12 months is not something he wants to see and has warned his chairman that the striker must be sold this summer if he does not agree to a contract extension. Kane's current deal is due to expire at the end of the coming campaign and, thus far, he has rebuffed Spurs' advances to sign a new deal, although in recent weeks Levy has made fresh approaches to his camp and made it clear he would be willing to make him the highest paid player in the Premier League. While Levy remains hopeful that Kane will be persuaded to sign a new deal, with new coach Ange Postecoglou key to those efforts, there is the option of selling him this summer and Bayern Munich are pushing hard to land the England star. Bayern, who have had two bids rejected already this summer, are determined to land Kane and believe that he does want to make the move to Munich this summer. 90min understands a third offer is set to come in. feed As it stands, Levy has refused to give a price to Bayern, despite them pushing hard and even holding face-to-face talks with him earlier this month, but German sources believe their next offer, which is set to be a club record deal worth around â¬100m (Â£86m), will bring the Tottenham supremo to the table. Concrete interest from elsewhere has yet to emerge this summer, with long-term suitors Manchester United, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid all looking at other targets at this point. Despite Lewis' demand to Levy that he sell Kane if no new deal is on the horizon, the final decision ultimately rests with the striker himself and sources close to the Englishman have been keen to highlight their position. Kane is now in a position in which he holds complete control of his future as he is able to agree a pre-contract in just six months and there is nothing Spurs can do to prevent that, but as Lewis has pointed out to Levy, they do not want that scenario to be played out."
"Chelsea, Man City and Arsenal eye Crystal Palace star Michael Olise","Jul 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-man-city-and-arsenal-eye-crystal-palace-star-michael-olise,"The France Under-21 international signed for Palace back in July 2021, signing from Reading for Â£8.37m, and has quickly become one of the most talked about young players in the Premier League.  In his second full season with Crystal Palace, Olise became the youngest player to ever bag three assists in a single Premier League game - achieving the feat in a thumping 5-1 win over Leeds United - and also became the first Palace player to ever record over 10 assists in a single season in the top flight.  Olise's creativity has caught the eye of some of the top clubs in the Premier League, with sources confirming to 90min that Chelsea, Arsenal and treble-winners Man City have all expressed an interest in the player.  feed The Citizens have been in the market for a new right-sided midfielder during the current transfer window thanks to Riyad Mahrez's impending move to the Saudi Pro League. Along with Olise, City are also eyeing a potential bid for Olympique Lyonnais starlet Bradley Barcola.  Arsenal have also been in the market for a wide player this summer, with the likes of Ferran Torres making their shortlist along with Olise.  As things stand however, 90min can confirm that Chelsea are the most confident of getting a deal done for the talented attacking midfielder. That is in large part thanks to the fact that the club already have a relationship with the Olise family as Michael's younger brother, Richard Olise, is currently on the books at Stamford Bridge.  What may make a deal easier to strike between Palace and Chelsea is the release clause attached to Olise's current contract. The 21-year-old deal at Selhurst Park, which expires in 2026, is widely thought to have a Â£35m release clause in it.  Outside of the Premier League, 90min understands that Paris Saint-Germain also retain an interest in Olise. "
Fulham reject Â£50m West Ham offer for Joao Palhinha,"Jul 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/fulham-reject-50m-west-ham-offer-for-joao-palhinha,"The Hammers are in desperate need of quality midfield reinforcements this summer after selling their captain Declan Rice to Arsenal. Rice left the club earlier this month for a British record fee of Â£105m, leaving West Ham with a gaping hole in their midfield but with a huge transfer kitty to help fill it.  West Ham have targeted Fulham's Palhinha as a perfect replacement for Rice thanks to his stunning 2022/23 campaign. In his maiden Premier League season, the midfielder completed nearly 40 more tackles and interceptions in the division as he guided the Cottagers to 10th place in their first year back in the top flight.  90min understands that Fulham rejected an initial approach regarding the 28-year-old's availability last week, and they have now seen a follow up approach and bid of Â£50m also be rejected by the London club.  feed Sources have confirmed that Marco Silva's side are holding out for Â£60m in order to sell Palhinha, but the Hammers are unlikely to go higher than the Â£50m they have offered.  Alternatives option that West Ham have considered are Youssouf Fofana from Monaco, Manchester City's Kalvin Phillips, Everton's towering midfielder Amadou Onana and a potential loan deal with an option to buy for Denis Zakaria - who spent last season on loan at Chelsea from Juventus.  Without additions, David Moyes will be left with just Tomas Soucek and Flynn Downes as options deep in his Hammers midfield. "

Brighton are prepared to admit defeat in their Colwill pursuit in favour of going after former Rangers defender Calvin Bassey, 23, who joined Ajax last summer. The bigger threat to Chelsea appears to be Liverpool, who 90min understands are confident despite the 'not for sale' stance at Stamford Bridge. feed Â Pochettino was bullish about Colwill's situation after the youngster played against Brighton. ""We don't need to make a statement about anything. He's our player and he's going to continue with us,"" the Argentine said.

But Al Ahli have returned with a two-year offer worth around Â£40m and that is now being considered.

Villa are understood to have parted with over Â£50m to sign Diaby, who becomes the Villans' new record signing. feed Diaby becomes Villa's third signing of the summer, following midfielder Youri Tielemans and centre-back Pau Torres in making the move to the West Midlands. It has been an expensive summer for Villa, who have relied on the experience of new director of football Monchi to help them land some high-profile targets and continue their push for European football next season. Diaby, naturally a right winger, enjoyed the most prolific season of his career last year. In 48 appearances across all competitions, the Frenchman racked up 14 goals and 11 assists, putting him back on the cusp of breaking into his national team. There will be a reunion at Villa Park for Diaby with fellow winger Leon Bailey, who left Leverkusen two years ago."
Kylian Mbappe: French players' union threatens legal action against PSG over pre-season snub,"Jul 22, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/kylian-mbappe-french-players-union-threatens-legal-action-psg-over-pre-season-snub,"Having already confirmed his decision not to trigger his contract extension beyond next summer, Mbappe has been warned by PSG that he will be sold immediately if he does not agree to a new deal. To ramp up the pressure on Mbappe, PSG decided to leave the 24-year-old out of their pre-season squad, insisting to the French forward that his only options are to agree to leave or, preferably, sign an extension. PSG's tactics have been blasted by the UNFP, who accused the Ligue 1 side of breaking French law by intentionally forcing Mbappe to accept poorer working conditions. ""These players - all of them - must enjoy the same working conditions as the rest of the professional workforce,"" the union said. feed ""The UNFP feels it would be useful to remind managers that putting pressure on an employee - via the deterioration of their working conditions, for example - to force them to leave or accept what the employer wants constitutes moral harassment, which French law firmly condemns. ""So, yes, the UNFP reserves the right to take civil and criminal action against any club that behaves in this way."" Mbappe's situation has attracted the interest of Saudi Arabian officials but 90min understands the Frenchman has his heart set on a move to long-term suitors Real Madrid. Real Madrid sources have denied claims that an agreement has already been reached with Mbappe over a free transfer in 2024 although Los Blancos are planning to lure him over to the Santiago Bernabeu within the next 12 months. PSG's asking price could prevent Real Madrid from making a bid this summer, with the Spanish side prepared to wait until January to make contact over a free transfer instead."
Roberto De Zerbi pokes fun at Chelsea with fresh Moises Caicedo comments,"Jul 22, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/roberto-de-zerbi-pokes-fun-chelsea-moises-caicedo-comments,"Chelsea have seen a Â£70m bid for the Ecuador international rejected, with Brighton holding out for at least Â£100m or the inclusion of centre-back Levi Colwill as part of a swap deal - something De Zerbi was happy to float publicly on Friday. Further stressing his desire to keep hold of Caicedo, De Zerbi took the opportunity to remind Chelsea that their disastrous campaign last year has left them without European football next season, unlike the Seagulls. ""It's a clear situation at the moment. [Caicedo] stays with us until my owner changes his mind,"" De Zerbi told Ben Jacobs. ""I don't know what can happen in the future, but if Moises leaves we have to find the right player because itâs difficult to replace a player as good as Moises. We have to substitute him with a great player because this year we play in the Europa League unlike Chelsea."" feed De Zerbi was again asked about the potential of a reunion with Colwill, who Chelsea are adamant is not for sale. ""I don't speak with Colwill. We haven't spoken for a month,"" the Brighton manager claimed.  ""With Moises I spoke with him once but not about the transfer market. I can say my opinion, but it's not my job. I'm happy to meet [Levi] but not discuss anything else."" Finally, De Zerbi suggested that Caicedo's desire to leave may not be as strong as reports have suggested. ""You have to speak with Tony [Bloom, Brighton owner] not with me [to see] if he wants to leave,"" the boss said. ""He extended his contract in February and now we are in July, so after five months I don't know if he can change his idea."" "

PSG looking to sell Kylian Mbappe this summer,"Jul 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-looking-to-sell-kylian-mbappe-this-summer,"Mbappe informed PSG earlier this summer that he would not extend his deal with the club beyond 2024.

Sources have now told 90min that Mbappe, who returned to pre-season training under new boss Luis Enrique recently, has been told to stay home by PSG ahead of their tour of Japan.

Los Blancos may consider making a move for Mbappe this summer if this tally is lowered to a figure in the â¬150m range, but it is more likely that they wait until January to finalise terms on a pre-contract agreement with the forward.

Tottenham maintain refusal to set Harry Kane price tag,"Jul 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-maintain-refusal-harry-kane-price-tag,"Kane is the subject of intense transfer interest from Bayern Munich, who have already seen two bids knocked back by Spurs this summer. 90min previously reported that Kane's representatives have begun to put feelers out around Europe that he could be available with his contract up in 2024. However, 90min understands that Tottenham remain confident that he can be persuaded to stay in the long-term and have not been told by Kane's camp that this option is off the table. Reports from both England and Germany have suggested that Spurs may be tempted to move on from their all-time record scorer if a bid in excess of Â£100m were to arrive, particularly if the payment structure was favourable to them. However, sources have told 90min that chairman Daniel Levy and the Tottenham hierarchy are still not entertaining the thought of putting a price tag on Kane. New head coach Ange Postecoglou met Kane for the first time shortly before the first-team squad jetted off for their tour of Australia and Asia, with the 57-year-old maintaining that one single conversation would not decide his future. 90min understands that Spurs are hopeful a positive relationship between the two will prove a major factor in deciding the striker's future. feed Postecoglou has admitted, though, that he is 'not relaxed' about the transfer saga and hope it can be resolved quickly one way or another. ""Fair to say I am not relaxed about it! It's not something you go: 'Ah, well, you know if it does or doesn't happen!' I mean it's a very important part of this football club, not just the team, but the football club,"" Postecoglou said.

""So, you've got to deal with it, and I think, for everyone concerned, we don't want to be doing it for too long. I don't think that is good for anyone. I don't think it is good for Harry, I don't think it is good for the club, because as laser focused as we want to be, you end up sort of repeating yourself along the way. ""But the flip side of that is I don't want to put a deadline on it, because that adds even more pressure. You want these things to happen for the right reasons. The reality of it is he's still a contracted player at our football club, so thatâs the way I see him. ""It's not like his contract is ending on the 12th [of August] and he's got to make a decision, he's got another year. So from that part, I am not relaxed but I am not putting pressure on him or anyone else at the football club, saying 'well we need to do this'.

"Man Utd transfer notebook: Bailly & Alex Telles close to Al Nassr, PSG progress on Ramos","Jul 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-transfer-notebook-bailly-alex-telles-al-nassr-psg-ramos-21-7-23,"Bailly has been told he can leave United by manager Erik ten Hag and has not featured in the club's plans for the duration of the Dutchman's tenure - spending last season out on loan with Marseille. A clause to make the Marseille deal permanent was not triggered last season, so Bailly is back in United's hands and still under contract. He last signed a new deal in 2019. The Ivorian, who has struggled with injuries for a large chunk of his career, has not been included in United's pre-season plans however, is not on the club's tour of the United States, and has been told by the club to find a permanent move away. His camp are currently in discussions with Al Nassr over a move to Saudi Arabia. There is interest in the player from other clubs but United want the player to agree a permanent move away, and they are prepared to sign off a low cost deal themselves to get the player off their books. Telles is in the same boat as Bailly in terms of being told he's free to leave United, and was excused from rejoining the club at the start of pre-season in order to secure a move. Telles was also sent on loan to Sevilla last season. 90min reported earlier this week that a deal was close for Telles to join Al Nassr for a fee in the region of Â£4m. It's understood that Telles was initially keen on a move back to Brazil with Flamengo before interest from Al Nassr emerged, though predictably the transfer to Saudi Arabia provided a far more lucrative option for Telles and United themselves. However, Forest have been made aware of the availability of another former loanee in recent days - in the shape of Keylor Navas. Navas spent the second half of last season on loan at the City Ground from Paris Saint-Germain, and is free to leave the club this summer with Gianluigi Donnarumma firmly established at the club's first choice. Navas was expecting more offers at this stage than he has received and his representatives are understood to have reached back out to Forest to offer up the prospect, with Steve Cooper's side now pondering their next move. Spanish goalkeepers David Soria, of Getafe, and Brighton's Robert Sanchez are other alternatives for Forest. Ramos was one of the players on United's long list of striker targets for the summer, though they have sharpened their focus on a deal for Atalanta's Rasmus Hojlund. As 90min reported this week, personal terms have been agreed in principle with the Danish striker and United are trying to thrash out agreeable terms with Atalanta in the region of â¬60m (Â£52m). PSG are looking for a new striker themselves and have held interest in Hojlund, but the 20-year-old wants the move to Old Trafford. The French champions have also looked at Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic, but are currently in talks over Ramos instead. Ramos made the headlines for Portugal at the 2022 World Cup, scoring a hat-trick against Switzerland. Benfica are looking for in the region of at least â¬80m (Â£69m) to sell the player, and are interested in signing Santiago Gimenez from Dutch champions Feyenoord as a replacement. Benfica have already signed Fredrik Aursnes and Orkun KÃ¶kÃ§Ã¼ from Feyenoord over consecutive summers."
Man Utd agree Â£15m deal to sell youngster to Nottingham Forest,"Jul 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-agree-15m-deal-sell-youngster-nottingham-forest,"A deal was agreed between the two Premier League clubs on Friday, with the 21-year-old set to undergo a medical with Forest over the weekend. Forest are also working on a transfer for United goalkeeper Dean Henderson, who spent last season on loan at the City Ground. United are working on the sales of a number of fringe players to fund their desired transfer business for the summer, having spent a large chunk of their existing budget on the arrivals of Mason Mount from Chelsea, and Inter goalkeeper Andre Onana. feed Onana's arrival at United was confirmed on Thursday, and he has flown to the United States to join up with the club on their pre-season tour. Elanga himself is present in New York but is expected to say his goodbyes and leave the club in the coming days. Elanga was the subject of interest from a number of clubs and it's understood he has turned down the options of moving to Everton, who are proceeding with a deal for Arnaut Danjuma instead, and other clubs such as West Ham United. Initially joining United as a youngster in 2014, Elanga made his debut for the club in May 2021, and had a prolonged spell of matches in the team under former interim coach Ralf Rangnick. Current boss Erik ten Hag has however preferred the use of the likes of Antony, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho in wide positions since his appointment over a year ago. Elanga only managed 418 Premier League minutes for United last season."
Man City continue negotiations with RB Leipzig over frustrated Josko Gvardiol,"Jul 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-city-continue-negotiations-rb-leipzig-frustrated-josko-gvardiol,"Gvardiol is City's top defensive target this summer and the European champions are happy to make the 21-year-old the most expensive centre-back in history by agreeing to a deal worth â¬100m, but nothing has been sealed. Sources close to the negotiations have confirmed to 90min that reports of an agreement between the two clubs are premature, with City and Leipzig still firmly locked in talks over the structure of any payments. Sporting director Max Eberl has even hinted that Leipzig would be prepared to walk away from the table if their demands are not met. ""The fact is Manchester City would like to have him, but currently we are very far apart,"" Eberl told Sky Germany. ""There is no agreement. Not even close. ""[Dominik] Szoboszlai's transfer [to Liverpool] secured us financially, we don't need money. We prefer Josko to stay."" feed Conversations between the two clubs are ongoing and Leipzig's refusal to accept City's current proposal is understood to have left Gvardiol and his representatives feeling frustrated. Leipzig are keen to receive as much money as possible for the Croatian and the fact that he is under contract until 2027 has only strengthened the German side's resilience in negotiations. Manager Marco Rose has also played down suggestions of an agreement and imminent medical for Gvardiol. ""Josko is one of our players and as far as I know he will remain one of our players,"" Rose argued. ""I don't know anything about a medical check, nothing about a first and nothing about a second. I think if it was, I would know as head coach!"""
Harry Maguire's potential destinations as Man Utd plan summer exit,"Jul 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/harry-maguire-potential-destinations-man-utd-summer-exit,"Arriving with all the pressure that comes with an Â£80m price tag, the England international arguably faced a losing battle from the moment he signed from Leicester. However, things weren't always as bleak at Old Trafford for Maguire, who was recently stripped of the Red Devils captaincy and replaced as permanent skipper by Bruno Fernandes. There were times he showed he can be a very good defender at Man Utd, particularly in the early stages of his time there. Maguire has now been told by Erik ten Hag he is free to leave United, with the Dutch manager even encouraging the centre back to pursue an exit having fallen down the pecking order dramatically in 2022/23. He is simply not as good as Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez and United may still add another defender during the transfer window. There are some potential options for Maguire this summer should he look to force a move, so here are some linked teams. Chelsea fans may squint at this prospect, but there is logic behind it.The recent anterior cruciate injury suffered by Wesley Fofana means Chelsea are light at the back and 90min has reported on the contact made with Man Utd about the England defender's situation.The Frenchman will be out of action for the majority of the 2023/24 season as his rotten luck with injuries continues, so there is a clear need to enter the market. The injury also means Levi Colwill is likely to stay put.It is favourable for United to sell him outright but they would entertain the idea of a loan and that would certainly suit Chelsea. It is unlikely Mauricio Pochettino would have enquired for Maguire if Fofana had not got injured, so a loan seems much more appealing. Another genuine link has come from West Ham. The Hammers have a genuine war chest to invest with following the exit of Declan Rice to Arsenal and some of that cash could be stumped up for Maguire, even though Irons boss David Moyes stayed coy when asked about reports of his side's interest.There is a lot that makes sense about this transfer, particularly from Maguire's perspective. He would still be very visible to England manager Gareth Southgate by remaining in the Premier League and would get a lot more game time than if he stayed at Old Trafford.Europa League football is also on offer at London Stadium after the success in the Europa Conference League. Tottenham have had a bit of a nightmare when it comes to centre backs in recent memory. The likes of Cristian Romero, Eric Dier, Davinson Sanchez and Clement Lenglet all left a lot to be desired during the 2022/23 campaign. Spurs' eighth-placed finish was their lowest since 2008/09, also becoming the first team in 15 years to both score and concede more than 60 goals in a single Premier League season. A new signing at the back is a pressing priority, with Edmond Tapsoba and Mickey van de Ven among their top targets.While Spurs may have loftier ambitions in the Premier League than West Ham, their interest in Maguire is previously documented with new manager Ange Postecoglou giving his approval to sign a new centre-back. Another case of replacing an outgoing player, Leonardo Bonucci appears to have been totally frozen out of the Juventus project ahead of next season which means Massimiliano Allegri will need a new defender. Maguire could fit in well in Allegri's favoured back three system at Juventus, with little expected in terms of playing out from the back.Danilo and Gleison Bremer are already central options in Turin and Federico Gatti is expected to have a greater role, but there is scope for serious minutes if Maguire could engineer a move to Juventus. feed"
Barcelona's agreement to sign new right-back confirmed by sporting director,"Jul 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-agreement-sign-right-back-confirmed-sporting-director,"Both Barcelona manager Xavi and president Joan Laporta have confirmed a new right-back is high on the club's wish list this summer after Hector Bellerin's short-lived return to Camp Nou failed to meet expectations. A whole host of senior names have been linked with the position, including Real Valladolid's Ivan Fresneda and Bayern Munich duo Joshua Kimmich and Benjamin Pavard, and the search for first-team reinforcements continues. At youth level, however, Barcelona have landed themselves one of Spain's most highly rated full-backs in 20-year-old Trilli, who is set to join up with Rafa Marquez's BarÃ§a Atletic side. ""We are writing all the documentation. His signing for BarÃ§a is imminent,"" Soriano told Sport. ""In fact, he is already allowed not to train with us because of how advanced everything is."" feed Trilli has been a regular for the third-tier side and has also represented Spain up to Under-19 level. He will initially help to reinforce a BarÃ§a Atletic side who have already lost a handful of big names this summer, including Victor Barbera and Ilias Akhomach. The door to Xavi's first team will obviously remain open, however, although the Blaugrana remain keen to find somebody capable of offering some immediate help. Sergino Dest, who has returned from his underwhelming loan with AC Milan, has voiced his desire to become Xavi's preferred right-back this summer, but a new signing is still expected through the door. Valladolid starlet Fresneda, who is actually two years younger than Trilli, is seen as a likely candidate, but the 18-year-old also has interest from the likes of Arsenal and Bournemouth."

Having since made his international debut for Brazil, Santos has officially qualified for a work permit and is free to represent Chelsea in the Premier League next season. Blues fans got a first glimpse of Santos in action during the 5-0 victory over Wrexham in pre-season, with the teenager impressing in Mauricio Pochettino's first unofficial game for the club. Pochettino is keen to take a closer look at a number of his young midfielders before making a final decision on the make-up of his senior squad for next season, with Santos' permit now giving the 19-year-old more options for the coming campaign. feed Alongside Santos, Pochettino is also looking at 20-year-old Cesare Casadei and 19-year-old Carney Chukwuemeka, the latter of whom recently stressed his desire to remain at Stamford Bridge next season. ""He's [Pochettino] come in and said that he sees the talent that he wants to develop and to help develop me,"" Chukwuemeka said. ""Whether that's in a month or six months, but I want to stay. ""I want to prove to everyone what I can do and help the club. So, at the end of the day we'll sit down, come together and decide what's best for me."" Chelsea also remain in negotiations with Brighton over midfielder Moises Caicedo but there remains a gulf in valuation of the Ecuador international, who has been hit with an asking price of over Â£100m by the Seagulls."
Man Utd hold talks with Fiorentina star over potential summer transfer,"Jul 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-hold-talks-fiorentina-potential-summer-transfer,"United have already brought in Mason Mount from Chelsea but are still in the market for a more defensive-minded midfielder as they prepare to listen to offers for both Fred and Scott McTominay. Amrabat, who shone at the World Cup with Morocco, is among the names on United's wish list and sources have confirmed to 90min that the Red Devils have spoken with Amrabat's representatives to figure out the terms of any potential deal. The 26-year-old, who is in the final year of his contract with Fiorentina, has been given permission to explore a move away and has been valued at â¬30m (Â£25.9m) by the Italian side. Atletico Madrid have also held talks over a move for Amrabat, while Liverpool and West Ham made early enquiries but have not yet advanced their interest. feed United have made it clear that they would need to offload a handful of players before formally pursuing a deal for Amrabat. McTominay has attracted interest from West Ham and Fred is wanted in both England and Saudi Arabia, while Eric Bailly, Alex Telles, Donny van de Beek and Anthony Elanga are among those expected to leave. In the meantime, Amrabat is due to return to Fiorentina training on Monday but the Morocco international is keen to see his future resolved before then. Fiorentina general manager Joe Barone recently admitted to Sky Italy: ""Sofi is very close to me, he speaks English and I hear from him almost every day. No official offers have arrived for him, I told him to arrive focused on Fiorentina, he must have the head to play in the Viola.""

West Ham near Carlos Borges deal; Elye Wahi of interest as Al Ettifaq eye Michail Antonio,"Jul 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-carlos-borges-elye-wahi-interest-al-ettifaq-michail-antonio,"The 19-year-old has attracted interest from a number of clubs after scoring goals at a prolific rate for City's Under-21 side - his 21 strikes helped them win the Premier League 2 title - and is in advanced talks over a move to London Stadium. The deal is expected to contain a buy-back clause for City, who regularly ensure they have the opportunity to re-sign some of their best academy talent, but would represent a significant piece of business for West Ham boss David Moyes. The Scot desperately needs to add more depth to West Ham's squad, with a place in the Europa League sealed after last season's sensational win over Fiorentina in the Conference League final, and Borges would be expected to challenge Said Benrahma for a first team place. Declan Rice has departed for Arsenal, in a British record move that could eventually be worth Â£105m to West Ham, and there's an appetite from West Ham to reinvest the initial chunk of money received for him into at least one central midfield recruit. Joao Palhinha, Edson Alvarez, Youssouf Fofana, Scott McTominay and Kalvin Phillips are among a handful of players interesting Moyes and new technical director Tim Steidten, who was appointed at the start of July to oversee recruitment this summer. 90min understands that West Ham are also eyeing a move for in-demand Montpellier striker Elye Wahi, as they anticipate a bid coming in for Michail Antonio from Saudi Pro League side Al Ettifaq, who are managed by Steven Gerrard. feed The 33-year-old has spent the last eight seasons with West Ham, scoring a club-record 61 Premier League goals, but is entering the final year of his contract and would be available for transfer should the club receive a suitable offer. Wahi is a prolific young striker who has enjoyed two breakout years at Montpellier. He scored 19 Ligue 1 goals last season as the club comfortably saw off the threat of relegation, and has held talks with Chelsea over a potential move this summer. However, the Blues are likely to loan Wahi to Strasbourg, the newest member of the BlueCo ownership group, if a deal were to go through, and 90min understands that's a switch the player isn't necessarily keen to make. Arsenal and Borussia Dortmund have also watched the 20-year-old while Eintracht Frankfurt see him as the perfect replacement for Randak Kolo Muani, who has been linked with a host of big clubs. Bournemouth, Crystal Palace and Wolves have also shown interest, while Lazio and Union Berlin are admirers in Italy and Germany respectively. West Ham have also held talks with Wolves over a deal for veteran full-back Aaron Cresswell. The 33-year-old has been in the capital since 2014, but wasn't a guaranteed starter for Moyes last season and could find his game time marginalised further should the club persist with the 3-5-2 formation they have operated with in the early stages of pre-season."
Sadio Mane agrees personal terms with Al Nassr in surprising U-turn,"Jul 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/sadio-mane-agrees-personal-terms-al-nassr-surprising-u-turn,"The former Liverpool star has been one of the more high-profile players linked with a move to the Middle East this transfer window. Mane is coming off the back of a rather underwhelming debut season with Bayern, scoring 12 goals in 38 games across all competitions and rose to infamy when he got into a physical altercation with teammate Leroy Sane following a Champions League loss. 90min reported in May that Bayern would field offers for Mane, though he initially refused to discuss a move to Saudi Arabia. Steven Gerrard sought to ramp up Saudi Pro League interest in Mane after taking over at Al Ettifaq, but 90min understands he has now quickly reached an agreement in principle on personal terms with Cristiano Ronaldo's Al Nassr. feed The move comes as a major U-turn, with Mane stressing that he would not consider a move to Saudi Arabia even as recently as a fortnight ago. Bayern believe they will not be able to recoup the Â£35m they paid to sign Mane from Liverpool but will look to bring in a sum as close to that as possible. The Bundesliga champions believe that this deal could advance quickly and Mane could complete a move to Al Nassr in the near future. Meanwhile, Bayern remain interested in signing Harry Kane from Tottenham Hotspur, though sources have told 90min that Spurs are still refusing to even put a price tag on their star striker."

Unai Emery's side will pay a fee in excess of Â£43m for the 24-year-old, which will make him the club's most expensive signing in their history, and the deal reflects their ambition to challenge the Premier League's 'big six' and become regular fixtures in European competition. Villa's new president of football operations, Monchi, has been heavily involved in the deal and has been pushing to bring Diaby to the West Midlands, with the Spaniard now set to land his man."

Mbappe informed Paris Saint-Germain earlier this summer that he does not intend to extend his contract beyond 2024, and 90min understands they have told him he will not be allowed to leave for free next year, meaning a move could be completed before the window shuts. Meanwhile, Kane's representatives have informed Real Madrid of his desire to leave Tottenham before the expiry of his own contract next year.

Fulham set Aleksandar Mitrovic valuation in attempt to stave off Saudi Arabia interest,"Jul 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/fulham-aleksandar-mitrovic-valuation-attempt-stave-off-saudi-arabia-interest,"The Cottagers have rejected two offers from Saudi Pro League outfit Al Hilal, with the second coming in at around Â£30m. Fulham rejected both approaches out of hand, despite Mitrovic making it clear to them that he wants the chance to explore the opportunity of a move to Saudi Arabia. The west London outfit insist they do not want to let him go, and to even consider a sale, sources have told 90min that Fulham value Mitrovic at more than Â£60m. The Serbia international scored 14 Premier League goals last season, having bagged a record breaking 43 in the Championship the year before. Mitrovic also has three years left on his current deal, which has led them to this figure in excess of Â£60m. As it stands, Al Hilal are ready to return with another offer, but it is not expected to be anywhere near the figure Fulham would consider. Mitrovic, although unhappy, has travelled with the first-team squad for their pre-season tour. feed It has been reported elsewhere that Mitrovic has told his camp he does not want to play for the club again, but it remains to be seen if that will be the case. As well as standing firm over Mitrovic, Fulham are also maintaining this stance with Joao Palhinha, who has been the subject of a bid from West Ham United and is linked with Liverpool. West Ham came in with an offer of under Â£50m, which was immediately rejected. 90min understands that Fulham again would want in excess of Â£60m for the Portugal international before they would entertain letting him leave. Fulham feel Palhinha was one of the Premier League's top performing midfielders last season following his arrival from Sporting. They have little need or desire to sell for less than his perceived worth."
The Brazil youngsters who could make big transfers next,"Jul 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/brazil-youngsters-who-could-make-big-transfers,"It's certainly not just Sao Paulo where the best Brazilian talent hails from, though. The South American country has developed some of the most incredible footballers the world has ever seen and there is little sign that trend is going to stop. Every top club in Europe has scouts dedicated to spotting the best talent in Brazil. Vinicius Junior is the poster boy right now but there are so many who went before him and more who will come after. The next two are set to be Endrick and Vitor Roque, who will join Real Madrid and Barcelona respectively in the summer of 2024. Here are five players still in Brazil who could find themselves heading to Europe in big deals in the near future. The speed with which European teams snap up Brazilian talent these days makes it very hard to know who will go next, but Victor Hugo's time in Brazil will surely soon be over.The 19-year-old is a central midfielder who has already made 60 appearances for Flamengo's first team. He has grabbed five goals in that time, earning links to Real Madrid, Barcelona and Newcastle.Expect his name to feature in the headlines in the next few months. Sticking with Flamengo, there is very rarely just one talented young player in their squad at any given moment. 19-year-old right winger Matheus Franca has already played 54 times for Flamengo and scored nine times.Chelsea have been touted as his most likely destination and he has earned comparisons to Vinicius Junior given he occupies the same position.He is rated at around Â£21m and would increase the contingent of young Brazilians at Stamford Bridge with Angelo Gabriel recently signing from Santos. manual Marcos Leonardo is a 20-year-old striker who has developed at Santos and could soon be in line for his big move to Europe. You can tell there's hype because there are plenty of YouTube compilations of him.Leonardo already has an incredible amount of experience for his age, scoring 44 times alongside 11 assists in 146 appearances for Santos.Lazio have seemed the most interested club in Europe, but it is not yet clear where he may end up. At just 17 years old, Luis Guilherme is one of the younger stars in the Brazilian Serie A. The attacking midfielder has only played 13 times for Palmeiras' first team but it often doesn't take long for a Brazilian attacker to be noticed.Real Madrid and Manchester City, two sides that are quickest to act when it comes to young Brazilians, have been linked. There have been some superb left-backs out of Brazil over the years and Patryck Lanza could become one of them if he gets the right move. While not a player necessarily expected to change the world, the 20-year-old could soon be due a move.Coming from Sao Paulo, he automatically has a certain level of pedigree. Patryck seems to be very popular among those that play Football Manager and FIFA, so expect to see him pop up in Europe in the near future."

City, though, are not the only admirers for the 20-year-old as Paris Saint-Germain and RB Leipzig have also made enquiries about Barcola's potential availability this summer. Indeed, PSG are pushing hard to strike a deal and have already spoken with his representative Jorge Mendes. The forward has, however, recently admitted that he is keen to stay at OL beyond the current transfer window, saying: ""I need a season to confirm [my progress].

I donât know how the transfer window will go, but I donât see why I would leave. I need to have a good full season, where Iâm a starter from the off."" Lyon coach Laurent Blanc added his opinion that he does not think Barcola or Cherki, strongly linked with Chelsea too, should be moving this summer.  ""I may be a little selfish but Cherki didn't have many games as a starter before the second half of the season,"" he said. ""Cherki like Barcola, being called upon by a big club is one thing, but winning is another. I advise them to stay another year in Lyon."""

It is a similar amount to what was spent on both Bruno Guimaraes and Joelinton, with only Anthony Gordon, Sandro Tonali, Alexander Isak costing significantly more.

Jordan Henderson not involved in Liverpool friendly as Al Ettifaq move nears,"Jul 19, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jordan-henderson-not-involved-liverpool-friendly-al-ettifaq-move-nears,"Interest from Saudi Arabian side Al Ettifaq, who are currently managed by Reds legend Steven Gerrard, was registered before Liverpool set off for their pre-season tour of Germany and Henderson made it clear he would be willing to make the move. Despite the ongoing transfer talks, Jurgen Klopp opted to name Henderson in his squad for this summer's preparations, but the decision was made to keep the 33-year-old away from Wednesday's matchday group as talks behind the scenes ramped up. Al Ettifaq have been in talks with Liverpool over a fee, with the Reds begrudgingly prepared to listen to offers after Henderson voiced a desire to seal the move. As such, those negotiations are understood to be nearing a positive conclusion. Henderson has agreed to a three-year contract in Saudi Arabia and appears to be inching closer to a reunion with Gerrard. feed Henderson may not be the only Liverpool midfielder heading to Saudi Arabia this summer as Fabinho is nearing his own move to the Middle East. Fabinho was not included in the pre-season squad and instead remained behind to negotiate the finishing touches on a shock move to Saudi champions Al Ittihad, who have already signed Karim Benzema and N'Golo Kante this summer. The Brazilian's exit is close to being confirmed, with just the details of Al Ittihad's Â£40m payment left to be arranged."
Thomas Partey joins Arsenal pre-season squad with Gunners not pushing for sale,"Jul 19, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/thomas-partey-joins-arsenal-pre-season-squad-with-gunners-not-pushing-for-sale,"Partey was granted permission to explore a move away from the club earlier this summer and was not included in Arsenal's initial pre-season squad. Clubs from Saudi Arabia registered interest in Partey and were prepared to make offers, but the Ghana international made it clear his preference was to remain in Europe. Despite a handful of clubs reaching out, no European suitors were prepared to meet Arsenal's asking price and now sources have confirmed to 90min that Partey is looking to integrate himself back into Arteta's squad. A summer transfer remains a possibility but would require a drastic shift, with no European clubs currently prepared to match the finances on offer from Saudi Arabia. feed Manager Mikel Arteta is happy to keep Partey in his squad going forward and has welcomed the 30-year-old back into the fold. Also re-joining the Arsenal squad is 22-year-old midfielder Emile Smith Rowe, who was granted extra time off after helping fire England to glory at the European Under-21 Championship this summer. Neither player is expected to play any part in the upcoming friendly against the MLS All-Stars and may even be kept out of the meeting with Manchester United that follows on July 22 as they seek to build their fitness.

Riyad Mahrez: Al Ahli agree fee for Man City winger,"Jul 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/riyad-mahrez-al-ahli-agree-fee-man-city-winger,"A Â£45m-a-year contract has been offered to Mahrez, whose interest was piqued earlier this summer, and the Algeria international spoke with Pep Guardiola recently to confirm his desire to leave the club and head to the Middle East. Guardiola, while reluctant to lose Mahrez, has a policy of never blocking an exit for an unhappy player and the manager made it clear to City's decision-makers that they should listen to offers from Al Ahli. A fee of around Â£30m has now been agreed between the two clubs, with Mahrez due to fly to Saudi Arabia for a medical ahead of putting pen to paper on a contract. Should all go to plan, Mahrez will become Al Ahli's third blockbuster signing of the summer. The Saudi side signed Roberto Firmino on a free transfer after his Liverpool contract expired and later struck a deal to sign goalkeeper Edouard Mendy from Chelsea. feed City are now looking for a replacement for Mahrez and had been among the suitors of Brazilian international Malcom, who is also heading out to Saudi Arabia to join Al Hilal. There has also been a renewed effort from City to keep unsettled midfielder Bernardo Silva. The Portugal international, like Mahrez, has asked to leave the club this summer, and while City have begrudgingly put an asking price of around Â£75m on his head, they do not want to lose the 28-year-old. Barcelona are keen to lure Silva over to Camp Nou, but Paris Saint-Germain are all known admirers of the midfielder. Silva also has his own interest from Saudi Arabia."

Sources confirmed to 90min in June that the striker had requested to leave Juventus, and that Allegri has given his blessing for the club to move him on. Speaking in his first press conference since being appointed, Giuntoli has hinted that the club are indeed willing to part ways with Vlahovic, saying: âWe have taken information from many clubs, but we are relying on Chiesa, Vlahovic, Chiesa and Milik. However, this doesnât mean Vlahovic and Chiesa will surely stay in Turin beyond the summer.  âItâs not a secret that we must balance the books. âOf course, if there are irrefutable offers, we must think about it.

All three clubs are maintaining contact with Vlahovic's representatives, though he is not the only transfer target on the club's radars. Bayern have also been weighing up moves for Harry Kane - two bids have already been rejected by Tottenham and a meeting held with Daniel Levy over a potential sale - and Randal Kolo Muani, while PSG have also taken a keen interest in Kane amid uncertainty over Kylian Mbappe's future. Chelsea are also in dire need of a new centre forward having moved Kai Havertz on to London rivals Arsenal this summer. Romelu Lukaku is also expected to bring his Stamford Bridge career to a permanent end, leaving Nicolas Jackson, a Â£35m arrival from Villarreal, and Armando Broja as their only natural options - Christopher Nkunku can play there but may play in the wide areas after joining from RB Leipzig."
Tottenham grant Davinson Sanchez permission to hold Strasbourg & Spartak Moscow talks,"Jul 19, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-grant-davinson-sanchez-permission-strasbourg-spartak-moscow-talks,"The centre-back is one of a number of players that Spurs are looking to shift before the end of the window, with 90min revealing back in June that Sanchez could be sold. Sanchez is currently with Tottenham's first team on their tour of Australia and Asia, with club captain Hugo Lloris the only senior player left behind to try and seal a move away. But 90min understands the Colombia international is edging closer to the exit door as Spurs have now granted him permission to talk to interested clubs. French side Strasbourg - who were recently purchased by Chelsea owner Todd Boehly - and Russian outfit Spartak Moscow will enter negotiations with Sanchez, while he also has suitors from Germany. feed Sanchez joined Tottenham from Ajax in 2017 for Â£42.5m, which at the time was a club-record fee. He emerged as one of the Premier League's best young defenders in his debut season but has failed to kick on. He was booed off by Tottenham supporters following a poor display in their 3-2 defeat at home to Bournemouth back in April. Nevertheless, Sanchez has made 205 appearances for Spurs and was part of the squad that reached their first-ever Champions League final. Meanwhile, 90min understands that Tottenham intend to loan out 18-year-old defender Ashley Phillips once he completes his Â£3m move from Blackburn Rovers. Spurs are set to beat Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United and Newcastle United to his signature.

Malcom made it clear to Zenit that he was keen to move on and his form had attracted interest from a number of clubs, including Paris Saint-Germain, Arsenal and Manchester City. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Malcom was a name being considered by City should they lose Riyad Mahrez to the Saudi Pro League this summer. Bernardo Silva is also wanted by clubs in the Middle East but would prefer a move to Barcelona. feed But Malcom is now ready to leave Europe and seal a deal to Saudi Arabia, with Al Hilal the club brokering terms. They are ready to pay around â¬40m for Malcom - the same amount which Zenit first paid to buy him from Barcelona back in 2019. Malcom is set to double his wages his Saudi Arabia and earn close to Â£350,000-a-week - a figure which would not have been attainable for him in the Premier League or back in Ligue 1.

Chelsea agree deal to sell Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to Marseille,"Jul 19, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-agree-deal-sell-pierre-emerick-aubameyang-marseille,"Initial talks between the two clubs earlier this week saw Chelsea request a small fee in exchange for Aubameyang's services, with the Blues also determined to offload the entirety of the striker's sizeable wages. Marseille were not prepared to pay a fee for the 34-year-old, however, forcing Chelsea into making a decision on Aubameyang's future. Chelsea had hoped that Aubameyang would agree to a move to Saudi Arabia, where a transfer fee and full wage packet were on offer, but the 34-year-old rejected the proposal as he has always wanted to remain in Europe. After making it clear that he would be prepared to see out the final year of his contract at Chelsea if he was not allowed to join Marseille this summer, Aubameyang has now been granted a free transfer. feed Aware that they were never likely to recoup a significant fee for Aubameyang, Chelsea have prioritised offloading the striker's entire wage packet which, over the course of the remaining 12 months of his contract, would exceed the sort of transfer fees on offer in Europe. The agreement represents another significant departure for Chelsea, whose mass squad clear-out is nearing its completion. Romelu Lukaku, Hakim Ziyech and Callum Hudson-Odoi were all omitted from Mauricio Pochettino's pre-season squad to allow them to continue talks over summer sales. Chelsea have already sold Kai Havertz, Mason Mount, Mateo Kovacic, Kalidou Koulibaly, Christian Pulisic, Edouard Mendy, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Ethan Ampadu, as well as agreeing to the free departures of Cesar Azpilicueta, Baba Rahman, Tiemoue Bakayoko and now Aubameyang."

Ampadu went on to make 12 senior appearances for Chelsea but has now departed for Leeds on a permanent transfer for a fee of around Â£7m. ""We would like to thank Ethan for his efforts throughout his time at Chelsea. We wish him all the best for the next stage of his career,"" a club statement read. Ampadu's exit now leaves Kepa, who moved to Stamford Bridge, as Chelsea's longest-serving senior player. feed Indeed, Kepa is just one of three players in the current Chelsea squad who appeared for the club before 2020, alongside academy graduates Callum Hudson-Odoi and Reece James. Hudson-Odoi is set to leave this summer as well after being left out of Chelsea's pre-season squad. The winger has been training with the Under-21s and is understood to have attracted interest from across Europe as well as Major League Soccer and in Saudi Arabia. One of the challenges for new manager Mauricio Pochettino is naming a new captain following Kepa's exit. The mass departure of senior players leaves Kepa, Ben Chilwell, Thiago Silva and Raheem Sterling as likely candidates. ""First of all we need to see the squad and I need to know and feel the players and the commitment, the character, the personality, both positives and not so positives.

Tottenham have been locked in talks for weeks with Bundesliga duo Tapsoba and Van de Ven. The former is believed to be their top target, but Spurs are hoping to bring Leverkusen's asking price down from â¬50m. Negotiations for Van de Ven, who would instead cost â¬40m from Wolfsburg, are slightly more advanced and the Dutchman is keen on joining Tottenham. Sources have told 90min that Spurs do not expect this centre-back saga to go on for much longer, just as Postecoglou had hoped for.

Newcastle confirmed on Tuesday that Saint-Maximin was not involved in their trip to Rangers and Eddie Howe revealed after their 2-1 win at Ibrox that the winger is in talks over a transfer. ""He's in early discussions over a potential move away. That's why he wasn't here,"" Howe said. ""It's doubtful he'll join us on the tour of America. I don't think Maxi necessarily wants to leave, but he may feel it's the right time for him to move. It's difficult for me to speak for him, but he hasn't asked to leave. There's been no issue between him and any of us coaches. We all love him. ""If he does leave, we'd lose him with a very heavy heart. He's someone we love working with, he's a difference-maker, we've really had a strong working relationship, and it'll be sad if he leaves."" feed Newcastle, who so far this summer have only signed AC Milan midfielder Sandro Tonali, are having to contend with Financial Fair Play issues. Sources from around the Premier League have told 90min that the North East club are under more scrutiny from relevant authorities than other sides due to PIF's ownership and so are having to ensure they don't make any errors. Newcastle ideally want to bring in another three or four new faces this window, but they have been struggling to offload a number of their squad players who are taking up a big chunk of the wage budget. This means other players, like Saint-Maximin, need to be sold to fund other deals - in this case, their move for Leicester City's Barnes. ""Maxi is the player that's generating the interest, FFP is a new dynamic which really came to the fore after my first window here when we knew it would impact us,"" Howe added. ""Player trading is a key part of it - you can't hit it, if you don't trade. We're forced to trade a player this window. If the deal didn't go through, I'd be delighted. It would obviously impact our ability to bring any more players in, and then we potentially might have to sell another player. That's the way that Financial Fair Play has hit us."" Newcastle made a move for Barnes at the start of this month and talks are now progressing. They are looking to finalise a fee of around Â£35m with Leicester and are hopeful that they will seal his signature. West Ham United had been in talks with Barnes and Leicester, but have been unable to come to agreement and now Newcastle are confident they can win the race. Barnes is a player that Howe has wanted for some time, as previously revealed by 90min."

Chelsea eye Harry Maguire transfer after Wesley Fofana injury,"Jul 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-eye-harry-maguire-transfer-after-wesley-fofana-injury,"With less than a month before the new Premier League season gets underway, Mauricio Pochettino's side have suffered a hammer blow with the news that French centre-back Fofana has undergone 'reconstructive surgery' on his ACL. Fofana is likely to miss the majority of the 2023/24 season as a result and, having already let Kalidou Koulibaly and Cesar Azpilicueta leave the club this summer, the Blues are now quickly assessing defensive options available in the current transfer window.  Sources have told 90min that one of their options is former Manchester United captain Maguire, and Chelsea have made enquiries about the defender's situation at Old Trafford.  The Blues' scouting department have cited Maguire as one of the best options on the market.  feed 90min revealed on Monday that Erik ten Hag has communicated to Maguire that the club are keen to sell him this summer, with the England international recently being stripped of the captain's armband by the Red Devils manager.  Maguire has featured sporadically since Ten Hag took charge last summer, making just eight starts in the Premier League during the 2022/23 season. This lack of game time has, expectedly, cast doubts over the defender's long-term future. The 30-year-old has been considering his options with potential interest from West Ham, Newcastle and Serie A giants Inter and Juventus also on his radar, but a potential move to Stamford Bridge could be his most appealing option this summer.  90min understands that while Manchester United would prefer to sell Maguire outright, they would also consider letting him go out on loan to Stamford Bridge too as Chelsea have the capacity to cover the player's wages in full - something other clubs would be unlikely to be able to offer.

Man Utd close to selling defender to Saudi club Al Nassr,"Jul 19, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-close-selling-defender-al-nassr,"The Brazilian, who arrived from Porto in 2020, spent last season out on loan with Sevilla after being told by United manager Erik ten Hag that he did not feature in his long-term plans. United have been looking for a buyer since Telles' loan expired in Spain at the end of last season, with Ten Hag firm in his decision that Telles was free to leave. Al Nassr have progressed with talks in recent hours and it's believed a deal is advanced, with the 30-year-old now set to join up with former United teammate Cristiano Ronaldo. Telles was interested in a return to Brazil, with Flamengo showing interest at one stage, but Al Nassr appear to have won the race having made a better offer. United were hoping to recoup in the region of â¬10m for a player not in their plans, but the deal is believed to be worth around â¬6m. feed Al Nassr have so far this summer signed Marcelo Brozovic from Inter and are closing in on a deal for Seko Fofana, the Lens midfielder who had interest from a number of clubs in Europe. Telles is set to join them in the Saudi Pro League, and becomes the latest big name to move to the league as a whole. Ruben Neves, Kalidou Koulibaly, Edouard Mendy, N'Golo Kante, Roberto Firmino, Sergei Milinkovic-Savic and Karim Benzema have all flocked to the league following Ronaldo's arrival last year, with Al Nassr, Al Ittihad, Al Ahli and Al Hilal all taken over by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund last month. PIF also own Newcastle United. For United, they are working on player sales of unwanted squad members before using whatever funds are raised to reinvest into the squad. Andre Onana is close to joining from Inter and his deal should be made official this week, while Atalanta's Rasmus Hojlund is on their wanted list. To move for Hojlund and to strengthen in other areas, such as central midfield and central defence, transfer funds will need to be raised. Dean Henderson, Eric Bailly, Harry Maguire, Brandon Williams, Fred, Donny van de Beek, Scott McTominay, Anthony Elanga and Anthony Martial are all available for transfer at the right price before the transfer window closes."

Mateo Kovacic has come in through the Etihad Stadium arrivals door, joining from Premier League rivals Chelsea, and is not expected to be the only Croatian to turn up in Manchester this summer. 90min previously revealed that talks were continuing between the two clubs, albeit slowly, and they remain in constant communication. Leipzig are seeking to make Gvardiol the most expensive defender in history, asking City for in excess of â¬100m before a deal can be completed. City are prepared to do that but the clubs are still ironing out the exact structure of the deal and when certain payments will be made. The 21-year-old has agreed personal terms with the Premier League champions and is awaiting the all-clear to travel for a medical. feed The Portugal international is a player City really want to keep hold of, though they have committed to selling Silva if they receive an offer that matches their valuation of around Â£75m.  The 28-year-old has so far resisted a lucrative approach from the Saudi Pro League and remains reluctant to head to the Middle East, while Paris Saint-Germain remain interested. But 90min understands that Barcelona are still exploring ways to cobble together an acceptable package amid their financial struggles and are in talks with Silva's agent, Jorge Mendes. Franck Kessie could be sold this transfer window, but Barca may need to sell another key name in order to raise enough funds and enable them to launch a bid for Silva. The German champions are waiting to hear City's definitive stance before lodging an official bid, and talks will be held between Walker and the Champions League holders this week. He could be even sign a new contract at the club, ending any hope that former club Sheffield United may still have of luring him to Bramall Lane. The Algerian winger was left hurt at being overlooked for both the FA Cup and Champions League finals at the end of last season, and he has the chance to join Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli on a contract worth Â£45m-a-year. Mahrez is due to meet with Pep Guardiola to discuss his future, with a move to Saudi Arabia only likely to happen if the Spaniard gives his blessing to the move. "

Despite already spending big, speaking to Sky Sports ahead of Arsenal's clash with MLS All-Stars at Audi Field in Washington D.C. on Thursday, manager Arteta hinted that the club may not be done yet.

Leon Goretzka makes transfer decision amid Man Utd & Liverpool links,"Jul 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/leon-goretzka-makes-transfer-decision-amid-man-utd-liverpool-links,"Though often seen as a lynchpin of their midfield, Goretzka has failed to start more than 23 games in a Bundesliga season for Bayern since his move from Schalke in 2018 and he was used sparingly by Thomas Tuchel towards the end of their most recent campaign. The Bavarians endured a particularly unimpressive 2022/23 season in which they secured an 11th-straight title on the final day due to a collapse from rivals Borussia Dortmund. Bayern have been looking to bolster their squad with high-profile additions this transfer window, with Kim Min-jae's â¬50m move from Napoli expected to be confirmed shortly and talks ongoing with Tottenham over a deal for Harry Kane, though Spurs have shown little sign of softening their stance that he will stay. feed Goretzka has been one current player tipped to leave Bayern to make way for a fresh wave of stars, but 90min understands he has no desire to leave the Allianz Arena. Bayern had informed Goretzka that he could be sold and his representatives made this known to clubs across Europe, but the midfielder's stance over a move has meant that they are unlikely to receive any forthcoming offers. Liverpool and Manchester United have been linked with Goretzka, and though sources have confirmed to 90min that both have monitored him in the past, they will not advance their interests due to his intentions to stay at Bayern. Reports in Germany this week have touted West Ham with an interest, but like Liverpool and Man Utd will not follow through with an offer while the midfielder is determined to remain in with Bayern.

During his single season in France, the striker netted 21 goals in 37 league outings - a tally bettered by only Kylian Mbappe, Alexandre Lacazette and Jonathan David.  Having rejected the opportunity to sign a new contract at the Gunners upon his return, 90min recently reported that the club have asked the player's representatives to begin talking to interested parties in order to find a buyer.

A huge stumbling block that clubs have found with any potential move is Arsenal's asking price. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Mikel Arteta's side are keen to get Â£50m for the 22-year-old, but the player's agents are hoping they can whittle the asking price down to around Â£40m.

City had hoped to persuade Gundogan to sign a new one-year contract with the option of a further 12 months, but he opted to take on the challenge of joining Barcelona, who wrestled back the La Liga title from Real Madrid last season. Gundogan was unveiled as a Barcelona player on Monday afternoon, where he provided insight into how a conversation with Xavi convinced him that now was the time to move. ""The first moment we talked to each other, I just felt it was right to come here, join the club and have the opportunity to prove myself at a different club and a different country,"" Gundogan said. ""I was close to coming here two times earlier but it was not meant to be. Now it is the time. ""Xavi made his ideas of how the team wants to play very clear.

Pep Guardiola had been the driving force behind City's desire to keep Gundogan, after making the German club captain after the departure of Fernandinho in 2022. And their close relationship is why Gundogan made sure that his manager was the first person to be informed of his decision to move on. ""For me, it was important that he was the first to know,"" Gundogan revealed.

Gnonto has been generating plenty of interest from Serie A, though it's a bid from Everton, believed to be worth around Â£15m, that has been turned down. A move is not out of the question for Gnonto, who may push to leave Elland Road with a place in Roberto Mancini's Italy squad for Euro 2024 potentially at stake. 21-year-old Amad spent last season on loan at Sunderland, scoring 13 goals in 37 Championship appearances to fire the Black Cats into the mix for promotion. Amad and Sunderland ultimately came up short, but his form in red and white has attracted the attention of new Leicester boss Enzo Maresca. He's looking for additional ammunition at King Power Stadium after losing James Maddison to Tottenham, while Harvey Barnes is also expected to return to the Premier League. As for Casedei, he's gone on Chelsea's pre-season tour after spending the second half of the 2022/23 season on loan at Reading, but is expected to depart for more experience. The 20-year-old is a defensive-minded midfielder who arrived at Stamford Bridge from Inter on a six-year contract. The Cherries surprised many onlookers by comfortably staving off relegation last season, only to then replace Gary O'Neil as manager with Rayo Vallecano boss Andoni Iraola. Hamed Traore and Justin Kluivert have already joined Bournemouth on permanent deals and there's hope a deal can be struck for emerging midfielder Scott. Wolves also like the 19-year-old, who is valued at around Â£25m. Kerkez is another prominent teenager to have caught the eye at AZ Alkmaar and is now primed to join Bournemouth ahead of Lazio, despite their return to Champions League competition. The 25-year-old has already been the subject of a rejected bid from the Cottagers, which could allow Brighton to step in if they're able to agree a fee with Fiorentina. The 22-year-old has spent the last two seasons on loan in Serie A - at Venezia and Spezia respectively - having already spent time at Sheffield United and RB Leipzig. A permanent Â£7m move is now in the offing, ending a Chelsea career that has offered up just one Premier League appearance."

Jurrien Timber reveals why Arsenal signed him,"Jul 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jurrien-timber-reveals-why-arsenal-signed-him,"Arsenal announced the Â£40m signing of Timber from Ajax at the end of last week, ending the Dutchman's near decade-long association with de Godenzonen at both youth and senior level.

Speaking to the club's official website about why Arsenal decided to sign him, Timber pointed to the similar tactics he enjoyed at Ajax as key to making the move. He said: ""I can see a lot of similarities, especially in the way Arsenal and Ajax want to play. Of course, this is a bigger league and everything is bigger here, I can see that immediately. This is the way they teach you in the youth already, and I'm happy I got to learn that at Ajax. feed ""I think also that's the reason they bought me and they want me, because they know I can play this style. And now it's for me to show everyone and also in the Premier League that I can do the same things."" Arteta also spoke to the club's channels after the move was finalised, hailing Timber's versatility as a reason Arsenal signed the Dutch international: ""We're really excited that Jurrien has joined us. He is a versatile young defender, who will fit into our system and provide our squad with so much added quality. ""Jurrien is a young player, but has already achieved so much. He has experienced what it's like to go to a major international tournament on more than one occasion, as well as the trophies he has won with Ajax.

Balogun had previously spent time away from Arsenal on loan at Middlesbrough, where he wasn't as successful in terms of goals, but now returns to the club as a full international after recently making his debut for the United States - he's off the goalscoring mark too after netting in the Nations League final win over Canada earlier in the summer. 90min previously revealed that Arsenal had instructed Balogun's representatives to step up the search for a new club, after his camp again rejected the opportunity to negotiate a new contract, and he has stated publicly that he has no intention of being loaned out again.

Youssouf Fofana on extensive West Ham target list as initial Joao Palhinha bid fails,"Jul 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/youssouf-fofana-west-ham-target-joao-palhinha-bid-fails,"The Hammers officially bid farewell to captain Declan Rice on Saturday, with Arsenal completing a British-record Â£105m move for the 24-year-old after weeks of intense speculation. Rice's departure leaves Tomas Soucek and Flynn Downes as David Moyes' only real defensive-minded midfield options - the latter played just 762 minutes of Premier League football last season, starting just seven times - while Lucas Paqueta and Pablo Fornals are two other options who can play centrally but thrive in the final third. West Ham have been preparing for Rice's exit for some time, knowing their former captain needed to be sold this summer in order to extract maximum value, and 90min recently revealed that Juventus midfielder Denis Zakaria is one player West Ham are interested in taking to London Stadium on loan with a potential option to buy. The Swiss international remains a concrete target for West Ham,  who appointed Tim Steidten as their new technical director at the beginning of July, but the club have an extensive number of players on their transfer shortlist - some who are players long admired by manager David Moyes, and others brought to the table by Steidten. Sources have confirmed to 90min that an initial approach for Fulham midfielder Joao Palhinha has been rejected - a player West Ham first showed interest in prior to Steidten's arrival - and it remains to be seen whether or not a follow-up approach will be made. Fulham are understood to value 28-year-old Palhinha at Â£80m, which would represent a significant profit on the Â£17.5m they paid Sporting CP for the Portuguese international less than a year ago. That figure is considered to be too high by West Ham, though there's a feeling that a deal is there to be done should the Hammers decide to stump a package worth Â£60m. Youssouf Fofana of Monaco is also emerging as a player of significant interest to West Ham. The 24-year-old, who made his international debut for France last year and played in six of Les Bleus' seven games at the 2022 World Cup, has significant experience of playing in the Europa League and early stages of the Champions League, and could represent far better value for money should West Ham look to exploit Steidten's knowledge of the European market. feed There's also a strong interest in Manchester United's Scott McTominay and Southampton's James Ward-Prowse, who are both players that Moyes has been a fan of for a number of years. The former is a bit-part player under Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford, while the latter endured relegation from the Premier League last season and could be available for a reduced fee. West Ham are also still progressing a move for Ajax's Edson Alvarez, who 90min recently revealed will not be joining Borussia Dortmund as planned. The Mexican international is valued at around Â£40m by the Eredivisie giants, and was previously linked with moves to Man Utd and Chelsea. Kalvin Phillips remains in the frame too, despite his apparent willingness to stay and fight for his place at Manchester City. The 27-year-old started just two Premier League games for the champions last season, and may be tempted by the offer of regular football at West Ham as he bids to be a part of Gareth Southgate's England squad for Euro 2024. Tyler Adams has also been offered to West Ham following Leeds' relegation, but there's no suggestion at this stage that the American international will be making his way to the capital."
Atalanta coach admits deadline on Man Utd's Rasmus Hojlund talks is unlikely,"Jul 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/atalanta-coach-admits-deadline-man-utd-rasmus-hojlund-talks-unlikely,"Manchester United are in the market for a new 'number nine' this summer and are making more progress with Hojlund, who offers long-term potential in the position, than much more expensive readymade players of interest like Harry Kane or Victor Osimhen. Hojlund has played fewer than 100 senior games in his career. On the surface, his nine goals in Serie A last season doesn't automatically suggest the kind of transfer fee being talked about. But it's worth noting that he was a teenager for more than half the campaign and that he was sharing minutes with more senior forwards that limited him to only 20 league starts. He also has six in six for Denmark. As 90min previously reported, United's first two offers for Hojlund have been rejected by Atalanta, who are holding out for up to â¬80m (Â£69m). Old Trafford officials are not willing to be held to ransom in the negotiations and arenât willing to go much higher than â¬60m (Â£51.5m). Hojlund wants to make the move and has openly stated in the past that he is a United fan. Now, 90min understands that talks between United and Atalanta over Hojlund are continuing, although at this stage the crucial breakthrough regarding an agreement is not very close. feed Clubs will often try and fix their own arbitrary deadlines during transfer negotiations, usually to get deals completed sooner rather than later to allow them to go back into the market â United have experienced in the past when talking to Borussia Dortmund about Jadon Sancho. But Gasperini has admitted Atalanta resorting to such tactics is pretty pointless. The transfer window for Premier League clubs to buy is open until 1 September, which potentially leaves a question over Hojlundâs future after the Serie A season begins on 20 August if a sale has not been agreed prior to that. Indeed when Atalanta signed the player themselves from Sturm Graz last summer, it was in the finals days of the transfer window after the season had begun. ""Even if we fix a date, 15 August, the transfer market isn't over,"" Gasperini said, via Italy24. ""If an offer [that is too good to refuse] arrives, the club, the player, decides later,"" he added. ""Deadline? I would put 31 July, but realistically there is no possibility, even HÃ¸jlund was like this last year. Everything is random."""
Chelsea lay out Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang demands as Marseille hold talks,"Jul 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-lay-out-pierre-emerick-aubameyang-demands-marseille-talks,"A Â£12m signing from Barcelona last summer, Aubameyang managed 21 appearances for the Blues in his first season at Stamford Bridge but saw himself frozen out of the squad by both Graham Potter and Frank Lampard. Both Chelsea and Aubameyang are keen to part ways this summer and the Gabon international was among the first players to be offered to Saudi Arabia, where an offer for Aubameyang, who will not travel with the Blues for pre-season, still remains on the table. 90min understands that the latest side to express an interest in the 34-year-old is Ligue 1 side Marseille, who have been informed that they must pay a fee and agree to take over Aubameyang's entire wage package. Such a proposal could be difficult for Marseille to meet but the French side hope their ability to offer Champions League football to Aubameyang could help them sweeten a deal. feed Clubs in Saudi Arabia are prepared to meet the demands of both Chelsea and Aubameyang but the striker is hesitant to accept a move to the Middle East in the hope that a top European side could offer him a deal. Former employers Barcelona are known admirers of Aubameyang but have far greater priorities for the summer window, particularly after the â¬60m deal to sign Athletico Paranaense striker Vitor Roque was agreed. Aubameyang was even in the Barcelona dressing room to celebrate their Clasico victory over Real Madrid in March as a signal of his desire to return to the club, but a move back to Camp Nou appears unlikely. The striker's representatives continue to explore their options and will seek to close a deal while Mauricio Pochettino and the rest of the Chelsea first team are in the United States for their pre-season tour. Romelu Lukaku is also due back at Cobham after Chelsea's departure and, like Aubameyang, is up for sale this summer."

Speaking to EFE, legendary Barca defender Pique gave his thoughts on the signing, hailing the player's ability on the ball and his character. ""I coincided with him in the Spanish national team on some occasions, and he is a great player who has been in La Liga for years. He has played for both Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao, two great clubs in Spain, and he has a lot of experience,"" Pique explained. feed ""He handles the ball very well, he has a great foot and a lot of character. ""With him, the centre-back position is going to be even more competitive because Ronald Araujo is there, Christensen is there, and Jules Kounde can also play there. The team already showed last season that defensively they can compete at a high level, and we hope it continues that way."" Martinez is one of three signings that La Blaugrana have made so far this summer, with Ilkay Gundogan also signing as a free agent following the expiration of his contract at Manchester City and the club recently confirming Brazilian prodigy Vitor Roque - who will not arrive until 2024.

Barcelona target misses training to undergo medical ahead of summer transfer,"Jul 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-target-misses-training-medical-transfer-oriol-romeu,"Barcelona want a new midfielder to replace departed captain Sergio Busquets and have set their sights on Romeu, a former La Masia gem, to fill the void. Talks between the two Catalan sides have been ongoing for weeks and numerous reports in Spain suggest an agreement has now been reached, with Barcelona expected to pay around â¬5m plus add-ons for the 31-year-old. To sweeten the deal, Barcelona are also expected to send young midfielder Pablo Torre on loan to Girona. Gerard Romero states that Romeu has been excused from training and has travelled to Barcelona's training ground to undergo a medical and put pen to paper on a contract. feed Should all go according to plan, Romeu is expected to become Barcelona's third signing of the summer, following Ilkay Gundogan and Inigo Martinez in sealing moves to Camp Nou. Romeu left Barcelona for Chelsea in 2011 having shone for the B team and managed two senior appearances, both of which came during the 2010/11 season under Pep Guardiola. His only La Liga appearance came as a substitute against Deportivo La Coruna towards the end of the campaign, with Romeu initially named on the bench alongside current Blaugrana boss Xavi, who went unused. Barcelona president Joan Laporta has confirmed there are plans to sign a second midfielder alongside Romeu, and a new right-back is also high on Xavi's wish list."
Romelu Lukaku: Roc Nation president speaks out on collapse of Inter transfer,"Jul 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/romelu-lukaku-roc-nation-president-collapse-inter-transfer,"After months of pushing to sign Lukaku, Inter abandoned their pursuit of the 30-year-old over the weekend after learning that he had spoken with Juventus about a possible transfer - despite Lukaku himself insisting Inter were his only option. The chaotic situation led to reports in Italy suggesting Roc Nation were so furious with Lukaku's conduct that they could tear up his contract with the agency. However, Roc Nation president Michael Yormark now appears to have shot such speculation down. ""Fake news and irresponsible reporting must stop,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""Focus on facts and the truth."" feed The collapse of his move to Inter saw fans with long memories dig out Lukaku's previous quotes on a possible move to Juventus from back in 2021. ""If Juventus or AC Milan will call me in the future? Never, never,"" the striker said previously. ""Again, never. It's never going to happen. ""Juventus wanted me before Inter, but when [Antonio] Conte joined Inter it was my priority to join them. In Italy, there's only Inter for me."" It's for that reason that Inter have been left so frustrated with Lukaku, who is now expected to report back for pre-season training with Chelsea this week. The Blues jet off to the United States for their pre-season tour on Monday plan to do so without Lukaku, with manager Mauricio Pochettino happy to move on from the Belgian and leave the recruitment chiefs to find a solution. Juventus remain keen on a deal if they can offload Dusan Vlahovic, while an offer from Saudi Arabia remains on the table."
Erik ten Hag informs Harry Maguire he can leave Manchester United,"Jul 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/erik-ten-hag-harry-maguire-leave-manchester-united,"Maguire, the now former United captain, confirmed on Sunday in a social media post that he had been stripped of the armband in a conversation with the manager, who outlined his reasons why in a meeting between the two. But it has been learned that there was more to the meeting than Maguire had publicly let on - with his departure not only green-lit, but encouraged. Bruno Fernandes is expected to succeed Maguire as captain but there has been no official confirmation as yet. Ten Hag transitioned Maguire out of his first choice United eleven over the course of last season and Raphael Varane, Lisandro Martinez, Victor Lindelof and even Luke Shaw have been established higher up in the pecking order of United centre backs in recent months. Maguire retained the armband when on the pitch throughout last season though saw minutes hard to come by. United have put Maguire up for sale for the right price throughout the summer, but Maguire has been keen to stay and fight for his place in the squad. The latest conversation between Maguire and Ten Hag, it has been learned, is a move from the club to guide the 30-year-old through the exit door - in hope it will change Maguire's stance of wanting to stay. The England international has interest from a number of clubs in Italy, as well as West Ham and Newcastle United, though his world record transfer fee for a defender and large earnings make the player difficult to offload.  United are aware that a loan deal is more likely because of the wage packet and any transfer away is likely to mean United will need to subsidise a part of the figure until the end of his contract in 2025. feed 90min revealed in April that Maguire's camp were working on exit routes from Old Trafford for the player and that remains the case, though Premier League rivals are pushing for good value deals as it stands - safe in the knowledge that United are looking to offload. Ten Hag is set to feature Maguire in match day squads and offer a rotational role if United can't offload the player and he is to stay, but United are looking to raise funds in order to reinvest and see Maguire as a primary candidate to leave due to his diminished status. Maguire's unwillingness to depart has already impacted United's pursuit of Kim Min-jae, the Napoli centre back who is set to join German champions Bayern Munich instead, but United are keen to press on with as much of their proposed squad overhaul as they can manage throughout this window. Ten Hag used last season to learn the players he wants to take forward with him and Maguire is one of several first team squad players who is up for sale. If they do manage to successfully offload Maguire, United may enter the market for a new centre back, but as it stands and with Maguire present, they have enough cover in the position. Next on the agenda is a new striker and defensive-minded midfielder. The club have already signed Mason Mount and Inter's Andre Onana is set to complete his United move before they fly to the United States this week."
Ange Postecoglou reveals 'good chat' with Harry Kane over Tottenham future,"Jul 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ange-postecoglou-reveals-good-chat-harry-kane-tottenham-future,"Kane has entered the final year of his contract and is of serious interest to Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich, who have already seen two bids rejected for England's all-time top goalscorer.

Postecoglou, who met Kane for the first time last week, was asked about the talisman's future during a press conference at Spurs' training camp in Perth, and the new boss revealed the details of the talks. ""I had a good chat with Harry,"" Postecoglou began. ""It was nothing earth-shattering as people are seeking. Just a good chat, introduced myself, and we spoke mainly about the club, where it's at and where he thinks can improve. feed ""It's not a specific vision for one person, it's about the group and we're perfectly aligned on that - we want to see a successful team this year. ""There are a lot of people who know Harry better than me, but he's not going to get phased by anything. He's here and while he's here, he's totally committed to what we're doing, and that's the way I've seen things. ""The discussion wasn't really about [the future], it was more about the collective and what we're doing. Harry's the same as all the other players, it's not something I ask when they walk through the door, asking have you got a ticket or not. ""It's about working hard as a group as we go along, some will be on for the whole journey, others won't, but a lot of that gets decided along the way. It's not something I'm demanding from people right at the outset. ""We've got nearly a month until the season starts, the transfer window's still open, so we'll see what transpires."""

Man Utd reach â¬55m agreement with Inter to sign Andre Onana,"Jul 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-reach-agreement-inter-sign-andre-onana,"The Cameroon international has been established as United's first choice goalkeeping target and long-term successor to David de Gea, who saw his contract expire and left the club earlier this month. United have been in discussions with Inter over recent days to come to a deal over the transfer of the 27-year-old. Inter had been holding out for â¬60m and had knocked back two offers from United for Onana, but a deal has now been reached after further talks. It's understood United have committed to paying â¬55m inclusive of add-ons to secure Onana's services. The add-ons themselves are worth â¬4m of that fee. United have already agreed personal terms with Onana, who has previously worked with United manager Erik ten Hag at Ajax, and Onana will undergo a medical before signing what is understood to be a five-year contract with an option for a further year. feed Onana is set to earn a base salary of around Â£120,000-a-week, with bonuses and appearance fees taking it to within the region of Â£150,000. It is a substantial decrease for a United number one goalkeeper in comparison to De Gea's wages - with the Spaniard earning in the region of Â£375,000 a week across his last contract. The deal is structured in a similar manner to those of Lisandro Martinez and Antony, who both arrived last summer, and is set to increase to closer to Â£200,000 a week as the deal progresses. United have been conscious to reduce the wages they are offering even to first team players in recent transfer windows, with existing contracts for Harry Maguire and Aaron Wan-Bissaka so substantial United have found it difficult to move the players on. Onana has been established as United's top priority in goal in recent weeks, after the club pivoted away from extending the contract of De Gea due to a drop off in performances in the final months of last season. Ten Hag has been behind the decision and wants to see United improve their ability to distribute from the goalkeeper - a key quality in Onana's game. United are also in the market for a second goalkeeper to become Onana's understudy. The deal for Onana being reached unlocks the door for Dean Henderson to move to Nottingham Forest in a deal which could be worth around Â£20m. Tom Heaton is also attracting interest from the likes of Everton and Luton Town."

With both youngsters set to join El Clasico rivals in the same year, there's been much discussion around who will have a bigger impact at their respective new clubs. Speaking to SPORT, Vitor Roque's agent expressed his confidence that his client is better than Endrick, saying:  âIf you ask me who has made a better hiring Barca or Madrid, itâs very clear. I have already said it in other interviews and I reiterate it again. In my opinion, Vitor is better than Endrick. âAlways in my life I try to be impartial, but I see Vitor Roque playing wearing the number nine for Brazil, for everything he does in every game with Athletico.â feed The agent also insisted that Roque was calm about his future transfer to Barcelona, saying: âVitor is very calm, he will not have any anxiety.

Fears that Newcastle could dip into that market of players in the future have been raised and Howe revealed such loan deals could happen. He said: ""That depends on if it is the right thing for Newcastle. We'll always act with our best interests first. ""I don't think the fees have been excessive necessarily - maybe the wages have, which is making it attractive to players."" feed Newcastle still have work to do this window.

Mikel Arteta explains why Arsenal agreed Granit Xhaka exit,"Jul 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/mikel-arteta-explains-why-arsenal-agreed-granit-xhaka-exit,"The Switzerland international enjoyed arguably his best Gunners season in 2022/23, having previously endured a love-hate relationship with the club's fans. Xhaka contributed seven goals and seven assists in the Premier League last term as they finished second and sealed a return to the Champions League, but Xhaka backed away from contract talks in May in a major hint that his north London career was coming to an end. The 30-year-old revealed he was won over by Bayer Leverkusen's long-term project under manager Xabi Alonso and sporting director Simon Rolfes after signing for the German side. Arteta has now backed up that account. Speaking after Arsenal's first pre-season friendly of the summer - a 1-1 draw with Nurnberg - Arteta said: ""There are three parts to this. He had a clear desire that it was the right time and that it was a big, big opportunity for him personally to move there. ""We had that conversation and at the end we all agreed that it was the right thing to move forward."" feed Xhaka joins a Leverkusen side that rallied during April and May to finish sixth and qualify for the Europa League, having been as low as 12th at the start of 2023. The former Borussia Monchengladbach star won two FA Cups with Arsenal during his seven-season stay at the Emirates, scoring 23 goals in 297 appearances.

A statement from PSV, who came second in the 2022/23 Eredivisie, reads: ""Xavi Simons immediately leaves the training camp to complete the transfer with Paris Saint Germain.Â The twenty-year-old attacker came to PSV last year and became an important player in Ruud van Nistelrooy's team."" feed Simons netted 19 league goals last season alongside eight assists and made his debut for the Dutch national team in 2022, featuring once at the World Cup during a knockout stage victory over the United States.

The 32-year-old has been away on holiday following international duty with Germany at the start of June and touched down in Barcelona on Saturday night ready to start his new chapter. Despite growing up in Germany, Gundogan considers himself a fan of the club because of how he was drawn as a teenager to the great Barcelona teams led by Frank Rijkaard and Pep Guardiola. ""I remember when I was a child and I sawÂ RijkaardÂ andÂ Pep's BarÃ§a.

Why do Chelsea want Rayan Cherki?,"Jul 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/why-do-chelsea-want-rayan-cherki,"The Lyon academy has produced special talent over the years and have a strong contingent coming through at the moment. Les Gones have often supplied the France Under-21 team with exciting youngsters on the rise. Cherki is one of them, so why exactly are Chelsea and so many of Europe's elite enchanted by him? 19-year-old winger Cherki has been involved in Lyon's first team since the 2019/20 season, flitting between the senior side and the reserves early on. However, he now has three heavily involved seasons in the first team under his belt, meaning he has mental and physical experience beyond his years. His versatility is another reason why Mauricio Pochettino wants to sign the Frenchman. Cherki has made the majority of his appearances in the number ten role but he has also played plenty of games on the left and right wings.   Cherki got five goals and six assists across Ligue 1 and the Coupe de France in 2022/23, which isn't incredible but there is genuine belief those numbers can grow as he develops further. Rather than focusing on just goals and assists, his various attacking metrics suggest he will get better. As shown by Sofascore, Cherki completed 81% of his passes in Ligue 1 last season, won an impressive 2.3 take-ons and 3.7 duels per appearance. He also created 14 big chances for his teammates. Cherki was only 16 when he broke into the Lyon team but coach Laurent Blanc spoke in 2022 about how he has had attitude problems in the past. ""He's a boy who has a lot of talent, everyone is practically unanimous on that,""Â Blanc saidÂ in 2022. ""He has a lot of talent, but it is necessary to use it well and use it for the good of the team. That was not always the case with Rayan and that led to some heated discussions with him. ""Rayan has been able to put his talent to good use. Afterwards, he must do even better. With him, you can be very demanding, because he has great potential. And while it's all well and good to say, 'I want to play, I want to play', you have to be able to keep it up and play well one match after another."" feed Chelsea are moving forward quite rapidly in their attempts to sign Rayan Cherki, partly prompted by Christian Pulisic's sale to AC Milan for â¬20m. That move frees up funds for a transfer fee, wages and some more space in the squad. 90min understands the Blues have reached out to Lyon to discuss a deal for Cherki this summer. Pulisic had been subject to previous interest from the French side but rejected their approach. A â¬50m price tag has been slapped on the France Under-21 international, though Chelsea are hopeful of striking a deal closer to â¬35m. Lyon are prepared to lose a number of first team players this summer due to financial problems and the healthy contact between the two clubs may work in Chelsea's favour. The west London side purchased full back Malo Gusto from Lyon in January for â¬30m and Cherki is understood to be keen to reunite with his former club teammate."
Two Man Utd players stay away from training amid uncertain futures,"Jul 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/two-man-utd-players-stay-away-from-training-amid-uncertain-futures,"Pre-season preparations for Erik ten Hagâs squad were already underway. But it was a primarily young team that the Dutchman put out against Leeds for last weekâs 2-0 friendly win in Oslo. The likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Hannibal Mejbri and Noam Emeran impressed during the game in Norway. France legend Raphael Varane was also there because he has retired from international football, while Lisandro Martinez and Mason Mount didnât get called up by Argentina or England respectively because of injuries they had each been carrying at the end of last season. But there were notable absentees throughout the travelling squad, with no Marcus Rashford, Casemiro, Bruno Fernandes, Alejandro Garnacho, Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof or Christian Eriksen to name a few. feed After just over a month off from the internationals that finished in the second week of June, most have now reported for duty back at Carrington. However, there were still two absentees on Saturday and they were Eric Bailly and Alex Telles. Neither player is believed to have a future at Old Trafford, having been pushed down the pecking order and out of favour. Bailly spent last season on loan at Marseille, where at one point he was slapped with a seven-game suspension for a wildly dangerous tackle, with Telles similarly at Sevilla. Both have a considerable number of players in the queue ahead of them for a regular place. Wednesdayâs friendly against Lyon in Edinburgh will likely still feature a number of young players but should equally provide some minutes for more senior stars. The pre-season tour of the United States that begins against Arsenal in New Jersey three days later will step that up. But it seems unlikely that Baily or Telles, without having reported back to training in the expectation that both will be leaving the club in the near future, will be involved."

Bayern are readying a club-record bid for Kane worth more than â¬80m and head coach Thomas Tuchel revealed on Saturday that they are ready to go 'all in' for the right transfer target. Speaking to the press shortly after Tuchel, Hoeness - who retains a place on Bayern's supervisory board - made candid comments about Kane, Levy and Tottenham. feed ""He [Kane] signalled very clearly that his decision was made. And if it stays that way, we'll get him,"" Hoeness insisted. ""Levy is clever. First we have to get him to name a price. He plays for time, is a great professional. I appreciate him very much. But on the other side [at Bayern] there aren't any people who have been doing this since yesterday. ""He wants to play internationally [in Europe]. Tottenham won't be there next season, unlike our club. He now has another opportunity to come to a top club in Europe. ""What we really like about Kane is that his advisors, that is his father and his brother, are very pleasant. So far they have always stood by what they have promised. And if it stays that way, then that's okay."""
Hugo Lloris exploring options in Europe and Saudi Arabia as Tottenham exit looms,"Jul 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/hugo-lloris-exploring-options-europe-saudi-arabia-tottenham-exit-looms,"The former France international is into the final year of his contract at Spurs and has already made clear his desire to leave. Speaking to Nice Matin last month, Lloris said: ""We are coming to an important moment, for the club or for me. It's the end of an era. I have desires for other things. ""I will ask myself to study what is possible, but I don't forget that I still have one year left on my contract with Tottenham and that, in football, it is always difficult to predict what will happen."" Tottenham announced on Friday that Lloris would not travel with Ange Postecoglou's squad for their pre-season tour of Australia and Asia so that he could finalise a transfer. 90min understands that Lloris has offers on the table from clubs in the Saudi Pro League, but he is also keen to explore options to remain in Europe. feed When previously asked whether he would consider a move to Saudi Arabia, Lloris replied: ""You can't go from a successful World Cup to being an average player in a few months. I had a few hard knocks, I was a little inconsistent in my performance, I got injured twice. I came out of the World Cup pretty dull. The pace had been hellish before that."" Inter, who are expected to sell current starting goalkeeper Andre Onana to Manchester United this window, and hometown club Nice have been linked with a move for Lloris by the French press in recent weeks. Tottenham have already brought in a long-term replacement for Lloris in Italy goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario. They had previously pursued a deal for Brentford's David Raya, but despite agreeing personal terms, were reluctant to meet the Bees' Â£40m asking price. Lloris joined Spurs in 2012 on deadline day from Lyon and was made captain in 2015. He has made 447 appearances for Tottenham."
Lionel Messi signs contract with Inter Miami ,"Jul 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/lionel-messi-signs-contract-with-inter-miami,"The player will occupy a Designated Player slot on the roster.  ""We are overjoyed that the greatest player in the world chose Inter Miami CF and Major League Soccer, and his decision is a testament to the momentum and energy behind our League and our sport in North America,"" said MLS commissioner Don Garber in a statement.  ""We have no doubt that Lionel will show the world that MLS can be a league of choice for the best players in the game. We look forward to seeing his debut for Inter Miami in our Leagues Cup tournament later this month.""  Messi previously announced his intention to play for the Major League Soccer side during a joint-interview with Mundo Deportivo and SPORT, revealing in June: ""Leaving European football, much more after winning the World Cup, was what I needed."" ""I made the decision that I am going to go to Miami. I still haven't closed it 100%. I'm missing some things but we decided to continue the path."" Though FC Barcelona remained confident of re-signing the 35-year-old for much of 2023 - with Messi's father, Jorge, even stating that his son wanted to return to the club at which he scored a record 672 goals in 778 appearances - the club's financial situation drove him to choose the American league. ""I had offers from other European teams but I didn't even evaluate them because my idea was to go to Barcelona,"" Messi continued. ""If the Barcelona thing didn't work out, then leaving European football, much more after winning the World Cup, was what I needed. Finishing my career on this side and living the United States league in a different way, enjoying day to day much more but with the same responsibility of wanting to win and always doing things well, but with more peace of mind."" Now, Messi is expected to make his Inter Miami debut on July 21 during the team's inaugural Leagues Cup match against Cruz Azul at DRV PNK Stadium in Fort Lauderdale Florida.  He will also reunite with former Barcelona players Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets, who will officially join Inter Miami later this week for their first training session.Â The three played together in Spain from 2012 to 2021, winning five La Liga titles, six Copa del Rey and one Champions League.  The players will feature under former Barcelona head coach Gerardo 'Tata' Martino, who replaced Phil Neville as manager on June 28.  The reinforcements will serve Miami well, as they sit in last place of the Eastern Conference table with a mere 18 points in 21 games and a 5W-13L-3D record. The team has a long way to go before reaching an MLS playoffs spot, having to climb to one of the top nine places on the table.Â  But the chance to lift the Leagues Cup and US Open cup remains on the horizon, as the team kicks off the interleague tournament on July 21 and play the USSF competition semi final on August 23.Â Â  manual"
Fabinho set for Al Ittihad medical as Liverpool exit nears,"Jul 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/fabinho-al-ittihad-medical-liverpool-exit-nears,"The midfielder was omitted from the Reds' squad for their pre-season tour of Germany as talks over a summer transfer to the Middle East intensified. 90min reported on Thursday that Liverpool had received a substantial offer from Saudi Pro League champions Al Ittihad for Fabinho. And 90min now understands that the two clubs are now close to agreeing terms over a Â£40m deal and Fabinho has already started saying his goodbyes on Merseyside. The 29-year-old is now due in Saudi Arabia for a medical after being given the Reds' blessing to finalise the move. Al Ittihad managed to topple Cristiano Ronaldo's Al Nassr and win last season's Saudi Pro League, while they have added Karim Benzema and N'Golo Kante to their ranks this window. manual Fabinho is not the only Liverpool midfielder who could be heading to Saudi Arabia this summer, with club captain Jordan Henderson also in talks over such a move. The England midfielder is wanted by Steven Gerrard at Al Ettifaq, who are one of the league's few powerhouses not under control by PIF. 90min understands that while Gerrard is pushing hard to get the deal done and there is a confidence an agreement will be reached, Al Ettifaq are currently reluctant to meet Liverpool's Â£20m asking price. Henderson is yet to give his total agreement to the deal and is still weighing up the offer despite reports claiming he's agreed terms on a Â£700,000-a-week contract."
Thomas Tuchel hints Bayern Munich will go 'all in' for Harry Kane,"Jul 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/thomas-tuchel-hints-bayern-munich-will-go-all-in-harry-kane,"The Bavarians' interest in the England captain dates back to last summer when former boss Julian Nagelsmann revealed his admiration for Kane, but that a deal would be hard for the club to follow through with due to Spurs' likely demands. With Kane now into the final year of his contract, Bayern have firmed up their interest with two bids for him this transfer window, but twice have been knocked back by Tottenham. 90min reported earlier this week that the Bundesliga champions were readying a new club-record bid for Kane worth north of â¬80m, while Spurs chairman Daniel Levy has met with Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen in person. However, there remains no indication that Tottenham will budge and sanction a sale of Kane this summer. feed Speaking at his first press conference of pre-season, Tuchel was inevitably quizzed on Bayern's interest in Kane, and though he refused to talk at length about the 29-year-old, he revealed the club could go 'all in' for the right target.  ""I have a very boring answer: I do not comment on players who are not with us,"" Tuchel began. ""It's well known that we are looking for a number nine. If we find someone that fits in, then we'll go all in. If we don't find anyone, we're happy with our squad. But we need more patience."" Kane has travelled with the Tottenham squad for their tour of Australia and Asia, with Hugo Lloris the only player omitted in order to finalise a move away.

Inter walk away from Romelu Lukaku talks with Chelsea,"Jul 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/inter-walk-away-from-romelu-lukaku-talks-with-chelsea,"The two clubs spent months negotiating in the hope of seeing Lukaku return to Inter on a permanent basis and an agreement was close to being struck before talks completely collapsed on Friday evening. A large part of Inter's willingness to keep negotiating with Chelsea was their belief that Lukaku was only focused on joining them. The Belgian has already rebuffed advances from Saudi Arabia and told Inter that a return to San Siro was the only thing on his mind. However, Inter officials now believe that Lukaku and his entourage have held talks with other clubs, including fierce rivals Juventus, over a possible summer transfer. While such conversations are legal and standard at this stage of negotiations, Inter have been left disappointed by the situation as they believed Lukaku's only interest was returning to the Nerazzurri - a message which sources insist came from the player himself. As a result, Inter have informed Chelsea that they no longer wish to pursue Lukaku and have walked away from talks. feed Chelsea had initially scheduled Lukaku's pre-season return for last week but pushed that date back until Monday in the hope that a deal to sell the striker would have been struck before he even needed to come back. Now, however, Lukaku is expected back at Cobham on Monday, although Chelsea currently have no plans to take the Belgian with them on their pre-season tour of the United States. Instead, Lukaku is exploring all his options. Juventus have discussed a summer deal, while the offers from Saudi Arabia have never been withdrawn despite the Belgian's initial reluctance to listen to the proposals. Sources at Chelsea still believe that Inter could reignite their interest if their relationship with Lukaku can be rebuilt, although that currently looks unlikely."
Chelsea & Crystal Palace chasing Flamengo midfielder Matheus Franca,"Jul 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-crystal-palace-chasing-flamengo-midfielder-matheus-franca,"The 19-year-old is a regular part of the Flamengo squad and already has over 50 appearances for the first team, racking up nine goals for good measure. Both Aston Villa and Newcastle explored January bids for Franca but 90min understands that it is Chelsea and Palace who are in talks with Flamengo over a potential transfer this summer. Palace have identified Franca as a potential replacement for Wilfried Zaha, who is currently a free agent after his contract at Selhurst Park, although the Ivorian could still end up signing an extension. The Eagles could move for Franca even if they can re-sign Zaha. As for Chelsea, Franca is yet another talent who has been identified in the ramped-up scouting of South America, which has already seen Andrey Santos and Kendry Paez seal moves to Stamford Bridge. Santos winger Angelo Gabriel is expected to follow suit. feed Franca inked a new contract back in February and remains under contract until the end of 2027, giving Flamengo plenty of security when it comes to negotiations. Chelsea are keen to bolster in attack this summer and are also interested in another 19-year-old, Lyon's Rayan Cherki. As well as chasing new signings, Chelsea continue to discuss a number of potential sales and are hopeful of parting ways with Romelu Lukaku, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Hakim Ziyech before the new season gets underway. Lukaku and Aubameyang have seen their pre-season return dates pushed back to Monday as Chelsea hope to have found buyers by then, while Hudson-Odoi is training with the Under-21s as he explores his own move away."

Despite productive talks at the beginning of June, Arsenal initially angered West Ham with their low-ball bidding. The Hammers stood firm on their demands of a nine-figure sum to be paid largely up front, with Arsenal eventually agreeing to a British-record Â£105m fee. manual Rice prioritised a move to Mikel Arteta's side over other suitors such as Manchester City, who ultimately were not prepared to match the Gunners' final offer, as well as Chelsea and Bayern Munich. And the 24-year-old has now completed his switch across London to the Emirates Stadium. Rice leaves West Ham as one of only three men to have lifted a trophy as the captain of West Ham, following in the footsteps of club legends Bobby Moore and Billy Bonds. He played a starring role in their Europa Conference League triumph at the end of the 2022/23 season, beating Fiorentina in a memorable final in Prague."
Fulham reject second bid from Saudi Arabia for Aleksandar Mitrovic,"Jul 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/fulham-reject-second-bid-from-saudi-arabia-for-aleksandar-mitrovic,"The Serbia international solidified his place as one of the Premier League's leading forwards last season, scoring 14 goals in 24 games following the Whites' promotion back to the top flight and finishing above rivals Chelsea in the table. Mitrovic has become a cult figure at Fulham during his six seasons in west London, but his future is uncertain amid interest from Saudi Arabia. 90min reported earlier this week that he and manager Marco Silva are being targeted by the Saudi Pro League, with Fulham already rejecting a Â£25m offer from Al Hilal for Mitrovic. feed Sources have now confirmed to 90min that Al Hilal returned with a new bid of nearly Â£30m, but this was again quickly knocked back by Fulham. Mitrovic is believed to be open to a move to Saudi Arabia and would like to at least have the chance to explore such a transfer, but Fulham are standing firm and at this stage do not have any plans to sell him. Al Hilal recently completed the signing of Mitrovic's compatriot and close friend Sergej Milinikovic-Savic from Lazio. They have also brought in Ruben Neves from Wolves and Kalidou Koulibaly from Chelsea. Meanwhile, 90min understands Fulham are looking to beat a number of Europe's top sides to the signature of 21-year-old Brazil midfielder Andre Trindade."
Manchester City expecting formal offer from Bayern Munich for Kyle Walker,"Jul 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/manchester-city-expecting-formal-offer-bayern-munich-kyle-walker,"The 33-year-old's future at the Etihad Stadium has come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks, stemming from Pep Guardiola's decision to omit Walker from his Champions League final starting lineup - a move that is understood to have hurt the former Tottenham fullback. 90min revealed in June that Walker, who is into the final 12 months of his City contract, had held initial discussions with Bayern over a move to the Bundesliga, with the Bavarians expecting to part ways with Benjamin Pavard this summer having already turned down the opportunity to make Joao Cancelo's loan from City a permanent deal. City are not expecting to welcome Cancelo back into the fold, despite his positional versatility, and have instead moved to offer Walker a new contract, in the hope that he will commit his future to the club in preference to seeking a new challenge. But 90min understands that City have been informed of Walker's desire to pursue a move to Bayern, with whom he has now agreed terms in principle. feed The seven-time Premier League winners are expecting Bayern to formalise their interest with a bid, though it's unclear at this stage how much Thomas Tuchel's side are prepared to offer. Much could depend on the future of Pavard, who may actually be in the frame to replace Walker in Manchester given his ability to play in central defence as well as at right-back. Bayern's move may also hinge on how much money they are willing to commit to a potential deal for Tottenham striker Harry Kane. Two bids for the England captain have already been rejected by Spurs chairman Daniel Levy, though dialogue has continued between the two clubs as the 2020 Champions League winners look to pull off a seemingly impossible transfer. As for City, they have long committed to selling players who no longer want to be at the club - indicating they will sell Walker to Bayern for the right price - and his departure may open up the opportunity for Rico Lewis, who was rewarded with a new long-term contract earlier this year, to play more first-team football. Their stance may be challenged, however, should Bernardo Silva, long linked with Barcelona and PSG, continue to seek a new challenge, while Riyad Mahrez, who was left out of City's side for both the FA Cup and Champions League final, is being courted by the Saudi Pro League and may find an offer impossible to turn down."
Arsenal confirm Jurrien Timber signing from Ajax,"Jul 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-confirm-jurrien-timber-signing-from-ajax,"Timber, who won two Eredivisie titles in Amsterdam, has signed a long-term deal and becomes the Gunners' second incoming transfer of the summer after Kai Havertz swapped Stamford Bridge for the Emirates in late June. Speaking to Arsenal's club channels on Timber's signing, Mikel Arteta said: ""We're really excited that Jurrien has joined us. He is a versatile young defender, who will fit into our system and provide our squad with so much added quality. ""Jurrien is a young player, but has already achieved so much. He has experienced what it's like to go to a major international tournament on more than one occasion, as well as the trophies he has won with Ajax. We look forward to welcoming and integrating Jurrien into the squad."" feed The Dutchman was absent for Ajax's first outdoor training session of the summer as his Â£40m move to Arsenal approached completion. Personal terms had already been agreed before Arsenal thrashed out a fee with Ajax. Timber predominantly played at centre-back during the 2022/23 season but has also played out wide on the right. His strong passing ability and eagerness to dribble could mirror Oleksandr Zinchenko's role on the left should manager Mikel Arteta continue with the central partnership of William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhaes. The 22-year-old spent time in Feyenoord's youth set-up before joining Ajax in 2014. He signed his first professional contract in 2018 and played for the development Jong side before making his Eredivisie debut in 2020. Ajax were then managed by current Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag and Timber was previously a target for the Red Devils last year. United continued their interest earlier this summer before Arsenal and Liverpool joined them in watching the defender. Arsenal submitted an opening bid of â¬35m which was rejected by the Dutch club, who set the asking price at â¬60m. Confidence grew in north London over a successful transfer and Ajax soon lowered their desired sum to â¬50m. â¬42m will be paid up front with an extra â¬5m in add-ons. The Gunners are still looking to wrap up the final details of their move for West Ham and England midfielder Declan Rice. Arteta's side managed to swat away competition from Manchester City to agree a Â£105m deal with the Hammers while the future of Thomas Partey remains uncertain. Granit Xhaka's exit for Bayer Leverkusen was confirmed on Thursday."
Erik ten Hag reveals Man Utd's plan for Amad Diallo,"Jul 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/erik-ten-hag-man-utd-plan-amad-diallo,"The 21-year-old, a Â£37m signing from Atalanta in 2021, enjoyed an impressive loan spell in the Championship with Sunderland last season, bagging 14 goals and four assists in all competitions for the Black Cats. Now back at United, Amad started the pre-season opener against Leeds and enjoyed an impressive 45-minute showing before widespread changes were made at half-time. After the game, Ten Hag said it was too early to draw conclusions on Amad but did admit some of the squad's youngsters had caught his eye. ""You donât make conclusions after one week,"" the Dutchman said of Amad, who has attracted plenty of loan interest from elsewhere. ""Some of the young players impressed me, but I donât want to single someone out. We are just in the first week, and I expected these levels and these performances. feed ""I will tell them during our sessions what I expect from them. How we judge the levels, the performance on Wednesday, what they have to work on. But after one week I never make conclusions."" Among those likely to have caught the eye is 18-year-old academy midfielder Kobbie Mainoo, who managed three senior appearances under Ten Hag last season and has been tipped to play a greater role in the first team next season. ""Itâs the first game and I think we have seen some good things,"" Ten Hag reflected to MUTV. ""Weâve already trained over the last year, so we have a good foundation. You can see that in the game. But yeah, also some young lads came in and they fit in. We are now one week [into] training. We presented the rules and the principles.

Man Utd & Barcelona fined by UEFA over financial breaches,"Jul 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-barcelona-fined-uefa-financial-breaches,"The European governing body drew up a lengthy list of clubs whose financial dealings between 2019 and 2022 would be monitored amid concerns over potential breaches of rules, with both United and Barcelona under observation. With all financial reports now submitted, UEFA have studied the numbers and ruled that the two clubs fell marginally short of requirements and have issued minor fines. United reported 'minor break-even deficits' and have been handed a â¬300,000 fine - three times as high as the other two clubs in the same situation, Konyaspor and APOEL FC of Turkey and Cyprus respectively. As for Barcelona, their fine of â¬500,000 stems from the misreporting of 'profits on disposal of intangible assets (other than player transfers) which are not a relevant income under the regulations'. feed A further nine clubs were monitored during the 2022/23 season after being set financial targets by UEFA, with French side Lille meeting the criteria and being removed from the watch list as a result. AC Milan, Monaco, Roma, Besiktas, Inter, Marseille and PSG all reached their targets for the 2022 financial year but will remain under observation to ensure compliance in 2023.

Callum Hudson-Odoi given permission to explore Chelsea exit,"Jul 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/callum-hudson-odoi-permission-chelsea-exit,"The 22-year-old recently returned from a frustrating loan spell with Bayer Leverkusen which yielded just seven Bundesliga starts and has now entered the final 12 months of his contract with Chelsea. Following talks between the two parties, Hudson-Odoi is now exploring a move away from his boyhood club and sources have confirmed to 90min that contact has been made with teams from all across the globe. In England, Hudson-Odoi is understood to have attracted interest from Everton, Fulham and Nottingham Forest, but the opportunity to move to mainland Europe with clubs from France, Germany and Italy is also on the table. There is even interest in Hudson-Odoi from Saudi Arabia and Major League Soccer, and all options are being explored as it stands. feed Chelsea are currently looking for a permanent transfer but would be open to a loan with a mandatory purchase clause next summer - an option which would require a 12-month extension of Hudson-Odoi's current contract. Hudson-Odoi has managed 126 appearances for Chelsea since his debut in the 2017/18 season but struggled to hold down a permanent starting place and saw his momentum derailed by injury. An Achilles injury in April 2019 brought his progress under Maurizio Sarri to an abrupt end and a similar problem followed three years later, meaning his last Chelsea appearance came in March 2022 in an FA Cup victory over Luton Town. Chelsea are looking to rejuvenate their attacking lineup this summer and have voiced an interest in Lyon's Rayan Cherki."
Man Utd reject Galatasaray bid for Fred,"Jul 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-reject-galatasaray-bid-fred,"Fred has fallen down the pecking order at Old Trafford and is understood to be considering his options, with United prepared to cash in on the 30-year-old Brazilian for the right price. United are seeking over Â£20m to part ways with Fred and 90min understands an opening proposal from Galatasaray has been rejected after falling short of that valuation. There remains plenty of interest in Fred's services but United's asking price could prove problematic. Fulham have targeted the midfielder but have made it clear that they do not share United's value of Fred. The Cottagers also have other targets in mind, including another Brazilian, 21-year-old Andre Trindade of Fluminense. feed Nottingham Forest have made contact with Fred's representatives but have not advanced their interest at this point. Roma have also reached out. The most concrete interest in Fred's services currently comes from Saudi Arabia but the midfielder is not believed to have made a decision on whether to leave United or not this summer. Fred managed 56 appearances in all competitions last season - only Bruno Fernandes and David de Gea featured in more games - but only 23 of those came as a starter. The summer arrival of Mason Mount from Chelsea has only added to the competition for minutes in Erik ten Hag's midfield, forcing Fred to consider his options."
Liverpool considering move for long-term Chelsea target Moises Caicedo,"Jul 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-considering-move-chelsea-target-moises-caicedo,"The Reds entered this summer with a view to rebuilding in midfield and have already spent Â£95m on Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai from Brighton and RB Leipzig respectively. There had already been plans to sign a third midfielder, with Southampton's Romeo Lavia admired at Anfield, but Liverpool could soon find themselves needing further reinforcements as both Fabinho and Jordan Henderson are considering moves to Saudi Arabia. Steven Gerrard's Al Ettifaq are pushing to sign Henderson, while Fabinho has significant interest from Saudi champions Al Ittihad, who are managed by former Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo. Thiago Alcantara is also a target in the Middle East.

Harry Kane: Tottenham chief Daniel Levy meets with Bayern Munich ,"Jul 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/harry-kane-tottenham-chief-daniel-levy-meets-bayern-munich,"Bayern Munich CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen travelled to London on Thursday to have a face-to-face meeting with Levy as they continue their pursuit of Spurs captain Kane. Bayern have seen two bids rejected out-of-hand but Tottenham and their stance remains that Kane is not for sale. Tottenham sources insist that the meeting was not just about Kane, but the England striker's future was discussed. It is understood that Levy gave no price to Dreesen and offered no suggestion or encouragement that he would accept any bids.  feed Despite Levy's stance, Bayern are still expected to make a third offer which would represent a club record bid, as the Bavarian giants are convinced that Kane wants to move to the Allianz Arena. Levy accepts and understands why Kane would be tempted by other clubs, but 90min understands that he has made it clear to his captain's camp that they would make him one of the highest paid players in Europe if he signed a new deal and also laid out a map for him once his playing career comes to a close. Kane, for his part, has confirmed to the club that he is going on their Asia-Pacific pre-season tour, while his representatives continue talks with various parties.  Kane returned to training this week and met new Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou for the first time and club sources believe the initial meetings were hugely positive."
The wages Jordan Henderson is set to earn at Al Ettifaq in Saudi Pro League,"Jul 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/wages-jordan-henderson-al-ettifaq-saudi-pro-league,"That is what has happened with players like Karim Benzema, Cristiano Ronaldo and N'Golo Kante. It could soon be what happens to Jordan Henderson, which would arguably be the biggest coup of them all in the sense that he is the captain of one of the biggest clubs in the world, and he is not out of contract and hasn't been linked with a move away up until this point.  The man behind the rumours is likely Steven Gerrard, who is the new coach of Al Ettifaq, the team that wants to stuff Henderson's mouth with gold to put his Premier League career behind him.  manual The phrase 'life-changing'  has been thrown around a lot this summer as a way of rationalising why players are deciding to move to Saudi Arabia. Whilst the money on offer is life-changing, it takes extremely rich individuals to an even higher level of richness. The phrase 'life-changing' has to be contextualised. That aside, Al Ettifaq are willing to give Henderson four times more money than he currently earns at Liverpool. At the moment, Henderson gets paid around Â£190,000 per week to be the captain of Liverpool, a club that he has been playing for since joining from Sunderland in 2011. If he makes the move to Saudi Arabia, he is set to be paid Â£700,000 per week...or Â£100,000 per day. 90min understands that Henderson hasn't ruled out trading Merseyside for the middle east and Liverpool will not stand in his way if that is to be his decision. Many fans have been very quick to criticise the midfielder for even entertaining the move. This is because Henderson strongly aligned himself with the Rainbow Laces campaign in 2021 and was quoted in a matchday programme saying: ""I do believe when you see something that is clearly wrong and makes another human being feel excluded you should stand shoulder-to-shoulder with them. ""You also have a responsibility to educate yourself better around the challenges they experience. Thatâs where my own position on homophobia in football is rooted. Before Iâm a footballer, Iâm a parent, a husband, a son, a brother and a friend to the people in my life who matter so much to me. The idea that any of them would feel excluded from playing or attending a football match, simply for being and identifying as who they are, blows my mind. ""The idea theyâd have to hide from it to be accepted? But thatâs exactly how too many members of the LGBT+ community feel. We know this because they tell us. So we should listen, support them and work to make it better."" Homosexuality remains illegal in Saudi Arabia and many are disappointed that, having shown such support on multiple occasions to the LGBTQ+ community, Henderson would willingly personally profit to such an enormous extent from a Saudi Arabian club. LGBTQ+ fan group Kop Outs tweeted a statement in response to the news that Henderson may play in Saudi Arabia, which said: ""Kop Outs have valued the allyship shown by Jordan Henderson. ""We are appalled and concerned that anyone might consider working for a #sportswashing operation for a regime where women & LGBT+ people are oppressed & that regularly tops the world death sentence table? ""We hope that Jordan Henderson proves to be a man of his word and stays true to the values of our club, which so far he has been an absolute embodiment of."""
Fulham hoping to sign Brazil midfielder offered to European giants,"Jul 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/fulham-hoping-sign-brazil-midfielder-offered-barcelona-liverpool-arsenal,"The Fluminense midfielder was a target for Fulham in January. They could not get a deal over the line then, but their interest in the 21-year-old has remained. Fulham were close to a deal at just under Â£20m during the winter transfer window, but any agreement now may have to be nearer the Â£25m mark. Since the Cottagers' initial interest, Andre has made his full international debut and a number of clubs are taking a keen interest in his future. feed 90min understands that the likes of Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and West Ham have all been spoken to by the player's representatives in recent months. But it is Fulham who are making a firm push and are confident of finalising a deal. Fulham, who are also in for Brazilian defender Igor from Fiorentina, are yet to make a breakthrough in the transfer market this summer, but they have already lost out to Tottenham over Israeli winger Manor Solomon. They could yet see Willian move on as the veteran Brazilian has turned down the opening offer of a new contract and is now weighing up options elsewhere, despite an improved offer on the table.  The club are also battling to fend off Saudi Arabian interest in both their manager manager Marco Silva and star striker Aleksandar Mitrovic."
Defensive midfielders Liverpool could sign to replace Jordan Henderson or Fabinho,"Jul 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/defensive-midfielders-liverpool-could-sign-replace-jordan-henderson-fabinho,"""Fabinho, Henderson, Thiago, Milner, Keita, Curtis Jones, Harvey Elliott, Fabio Carvalho, Oxlade-Chamberlain,"" the manager rattled off. ""Now you tell me what kind of player are we missing?"" Well, Klopp has lost plenty of those players in just 12 months. James Milner, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain were allowed to leave at the end of their contracts and Carvalho will spend next season on loan at RB Leipzig. Thiago Alcantara fended off interest from Saudi Arabia but Jordan Henderson and Fabinho may not be as strong willed. Liverpool's skipper is considering an offer to reunite with former teammate Steven Gerrard at Al Ettifaq while Pro League champions Al-Ittihad are keen on adding Fabinho to a side which includes Karim Benzema, N'Golo Kante and Jota (not Diogo). Klopp has already bolstered Liverpool's offensive central options with the acquisitions of Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai this summer. But the base of midfield will need to be stiffened up if one or both of Henderson and Fabinho chase the Saudi silver. Here are some alternatives which Klopp may want to mull over. Liverpool are one of at least six clubs that harbour a burning desire to prevent Southampton's Lavia from slipping into the Championship. A tenacious attitude off the ball and an eye for a defence-splitting pass are some of the attributes that make him so sought after. However, the 19-year-old is understandably raw. Liverpool already have a promising teenager capable of fulfilling Fabinho's duties at the base of midfield in the form of Stefan Bajcetic and are reticent to meet Southampton's lofty Â£45m asking price for Lavia. Thuram insisted that he was 'happy' at Nice in June but that was before the club took the surprising decision to turn down the chance to make Didier Digard permanent manager. Thuram forged a strong bond with the interim boss who 'helped me a lot in difficult times in my young career'. The burgeoning midfielder described Digard as 'someone I can never thank enough'. Klopp inspires similar loyalty from many of his players and will be itching to bring Thuram's blend of dexterity and industry to Merseyside. While he may not offer the natural defensive rigidity of Fabinho, Thuram brings the drive that had begun to fade from Henderson's game last season. Nottingham Forest have been nowhere near as active as last summer's splurge but the Tricky Trees have identified PSV's Sangare as a potential recruit. Liverpool haven't directly vied with Forest for many transfers since the early 1980s but they would also benefit from the acquisition of the towering midfielder. Boasting a yawning wingspan of limbs that can gobble up the ball and send it firing towards the opposition net at a frightening velocity, PSV were understandably thrilled when Sangare signed a five-year deal last summer.  However, the departure of manager Ruud van Nistelrooy has knocked the club sideways, with Sangare thought to be one of the fiercest critics of the move. This unease could offer Liverpool an opening to pounce. While watching the 2022 Champions League final, Tchouameni began fervently messaging his representatives. Liverpool and Real Madrid, the two finalists in Paris last year, had been in the race for the Frenchman's signature but Tchouameni had decided; he wanted to join the Champions League winners. Without quite setting the world alight, Tchouameni enjoyed a decent debut campaign in the Spanish capital, aided by his rapid grasp of the language. However, through little fault of his own, Tchouameni could be on his way out of Madrid after Los Blancos added Jude Bellingham to their bulging roster. Liverpool were also heavily linked with Bellingham this summer but could end up getting former flirt Tchouameni - it would certainly be a case of better late than never. Already an established starter for Borussia Monchengladbach, Kone has been keen to stress his development. ""I could be labelled an 'up-and-coming player',"" the France under-21 international explained, ""...but I wouldn't say I'm a 'young player', as I've already picked up quite a few things."" Those qualities include a beguiling ability to weave forward with the ball and win back possession. No Bundesliga midfielder was fouled more often than the wriggling menace who finished the season as Gladbach's leader for tackles, blocks and recoveries."
Christian Pulisic officially leaves Chelsea for AC Milan ,"Jul 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/christian-pulisic-officially-leaves-chelsea-ac-milan,"The 24-year-old departs the Premier League after four years, where he managed 145 appearances across all competitions and a UEFA Champions League title in 2021.

""Iâm very happy to be here. Iâm excited. Iâm excited to start with this historic club,"" Pulisic said before signing.

Aston Villa rebuffed with opening offer for Moussa Diaby,"Jul 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/aston-villa-rebuffed-opening-offer-moussa-diaby,"Villa are in the market for wingers and have already seen moves for Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams and Barcelona pair Ferran Torres and Ansu Fati fail to materialise. They also came close to landing Marcos Asensio, before the Spaniard chose to join Paris Saint Germain after leaving Real Madrid. However, Villa are working hard on options - which also include Nottingham Forest's Brennan Johnson - and have turned their attention to Diaby, who has long been a target for Premier League clubs. Newcastle have been long-term suitors and held talks last summer, while Arsenal have also been monitoring his situation for a number of months. But Villa made the first move and have lodged an opening offer worth â¬35m (Â£30m) plus add-ons. 90min understands that Leverkusen wasted little time in rejecting the bid though. The Bundesliga club have made it clear they want around â¬60m (Â£51m) for Diaby, although sources have told 90min that they expect an offer worth over â¬50m (Â£43m) could be enough to land the 24-year-old, who is under contact at the BayArena until 2025. Talks have already taken place with Diaby's camp and the belief is that he would be happy to move to Villa Park, where Unai Emery, along with new president of footballing operations Monchi, is plotting an assault on the Premier League top four after a blistering end to last season. feed Having already landed Belgian midfielder Youri Tielemans and Spanish defender Pau Torres, Villa have now turned their attention to the attacking third of the pitch and it is believed they could bring in two new forwards - they now hope one of those is Diaby. It is understood that talks have continued, despite Leverkusen rejecting the first offer. The Germans remain hopeful that Diaby will opt to stay put and continue his development under Xabi Alonso. In that respect, the winger has admitted he has enjoyed life under the boss so far. ""When he got here, the first thing he did was to change the mentality within the squad. He asked us to forget about what happened before he got there, and told us to play as if we were starting a new season,"" Diaby explained. ""He brought his experience to the club; he uses what he has been through as a player to help us improve on a daily basis. He's done really well so far, so long may it continue. We're very happy that he's our head coach."""
Chelsea open talks with Lyon over Rayan Cherki,"Jul 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-open-talks-lyon-rayan-cherki,"The Blues are rejuvenating their attacking line this summer. Both Mason Mount and Kai Havertz have already left, while Christian Pulisic's move to AC Milan is imminent and there are further plans to part ways with Hakim Ziyech, Romelu Lukaku, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Callum Hudson-Odoi. Nicolas Jackson and Christopher Nkunku have arrived at Stamford Bridge but another creative forward is desired and sources have confirmed to 90min that Cherki has emerged as a player of real interest. Chelsea officials have followed Cherki for a while now and have been hugely impressed by the 19-year-old, and the Blues have reached out to Lyon to discuss a possible summer move. Lyon, who are prepared to offload a handful of big names as they battle financial problems, have put a price tag of â¬50m (Â£43m) on Cherki's head. Such a fee is thought to be too high for Chelsea, who believe a deal can be struck for closer to the â¬35m (Â£30m) mark.  feed The two clubs have already had plenty of contact in 2023.

Cherki, whose contract has two years left to run, is understood to be keen to reunite with Gusto at Stamford Bridge. Elsewhere, 90min understands that Chelsea chiefs have held talks over another French star, Montpellier striker Elye Wahi, while Egyptian winger Ibrahim Adel has also emerged as a potential signing. Both players could be targets for the Blues' new sister side, Strasbourg.

Everton in talks over deal for Man Utd winger,"Jul 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/everton-talks-deal-man-utd-winger-anthony-elanga,"Elanga turned 21 in April and has been a permanent member of the first-team squad at Old Trafford since 2021. He has made 55 senior appearances to date, including 26 this past season. But the former Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year only started five times in the Premier League and not at all in 2023, coinciding with the emergence of Alejandro Garnacho. He also failed to find the net and registered just two assists, always difficult with limited minutes off the bench. With competition for wide places ahead of 2023/24 coming from the increasingly important Garnacho, as well as Marcus Rashford and Â£160m duo Jadon Sancho and Antony, Elanga may find opportunities increasingly hard to come by. Erik ten Hag also has Facundo Pellistri at his disposal, while Noam Emeran pushed himself into contention with a goal and assist in pre-season this week. 90min understands that Everton are eyeing a permanent transfer for Elanga, although budgetary constraints could see their approach take the form of an initial loan with obligation to buy. The Toffees have signed only one player this summer and that is 38-year-old free agent Ashley Young. feed But Everton are not the only club keeping tabs on Elanga. Nottingham Forest have held talks of their own, with Fulham and Crystal Palace also watching the situation. Prior interest had come from the Championship, which has been a happy development league for fellow United youngsters Amad Diallo, Hannibal Mejbri and Alvaro Fernandez within the last 12 months â all three started and impressed in the Leeds friendly in Norway this week. Middlesbrough, Coventry, Stoke and Birmingham, the latter where Hannibal was based and with whom United have also previously done business over Tahith Chong, have shown interest. Galatasaray, crowned Turkish champions last season for the first time in four years, have had Elanga on their radar from a little further afield.

Oriol Romeu: Girona president confirms meeting with Barcelona,"Jul 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/oriol-romeu-girona-president-confirms-meeting-barcelona,"Barcelona want two new midfielders this summer following the departure of the influential Sergio Busquets and former La Masia starlet Romeu has been identified as a serious target. The 31-year-old has a release clause of under â¬10m written into the Girona contract he signed last summer, making him a feasible target for Barcelona. Barcelona president Joan Laporta recently angered Girona fans by claiming to L'Esportiu: ""If we sign a player from Girona, BarÃ§a is helping Girona. Any purchase operation we do with Girona, or loaning them players, I think we're helping Girona. I see it that way."" In response, Girona's Guardiola urged Laporta to rethink his approach if they truly want to 'help'. ""If BarÃ§a wants to do us a favour, they don't sign Oriol from us,"" Guardiola told the media. ""It's a reality. We're planning the season with him here, so they're not doing us any favours. feed ""17-18 days ago we spoke with Mateu [Alemany, Barcelona sporting director] to find out what the situation was and two days ago we arranged to see each other soon. ""We have said from the first day that we are planning the season with him in it, he is very important for us. Our position is clear, there is no issue at the moment. We will see how we move, Oriol has a contract with us, we plan everything with him and from the outset we do not consider anything else than Oriol is still here."" The relationship between the two Catalan sides has soured since Girona's return to La Liga, which was marked by a video from the Gironistes showing a young child choosing their shirt over a Barcelona kit. Last summer also saw Barcelona prove tricky to work with as Girona tried to sign Ez Abde, Mika Marmol and Alex Collado. Former Girona president Francesc Rebled, a current socio at Barcelona, recalled to El Confidencial how Barcelona refused to help his club between 2013 and 2015. ""My personal opinion is that BarÃ§a has no interest in helping the rest of the Catalan clubs and, at that time, they had a policy of not giving us footballers,"" he explained.  ""We needed players because our economic situation was bad and only Espanyol in Catalonia helped us. We spoke with Joan Collet, the Espanyol president at the time, and he loaned us players at a good price. With BarÃ§a it was impossible and, what's worse, they gave up players to other teams in our league instead of us.

Bitello has emerged as an Arsenal target through sporting director Edu, who has used his contacts in his homeland to target him and line up a prospective deal. Sources have told 90min that it is a similar situation to that which saw them sign Gabriel Martinelli from Ituano in 2019 - a player who is under the radar in Brazil, but one who their scouts believe could make an impact in the Premier League. feed It is believed Gremio are prepared to accept a deal worth Â£8.5m including potential profit from any future sale. Talks are ongoing but sources believe a deal could be struck this week.

Sadio Mane targeted by Steven Gerrard's Al Ettifaq,"Jul 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/sadio-mane-targeted-by-steven-gerrard-al-ettifaq,"Mane, an Anfield icon in his own right, swapped Merseyside for Bavaria last summer following an incredibly successful six-year spell with the Reds.

Why do top clubs want to sign Levi Colwill?,"Jul 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/why-top-clubs-want-sign-levi-colwill-chelsea-liverpool-brighton,"By winning the tournament with the Three Lions and impressing thoroughly along the way, the Blues will now have to fend off interest from other top clubs for the centre-back. The 20-year-old spent last season on loan at Brighton and made such a positive impression at the Amex that the Seagulls are desperate to bring him to the south coast permanently. Liverpool have since also joined the race for Colwill. They are ready to make an offer of their own and are confident they will be successful. New Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino is set to hold talks with the phenom when he returns from international duty. However, Colwill is yet to be persuaded his long-term future is at Stamford Bridge. With what comes next uncertain, why are top clubs interested in signing Colwill? A versatile player capable of playing at centre-back and left-back, Colwill has all the attributes of a top modern defender. His pace, physicality and tactical understanding makes him a highly-desirable asset for any top club interested in playing on the front foot. One of Colwill's key strengths is his technical ability, boasting a great passing range. He ranked in the top 10% of Premier League centre-backs per 90 last season for progressive passing distance, passes into the final third and key passes, making him a perfect candidate for teams wanting to play out from defence. Colwill was often comfortable stepping into midfield from defence for the Seagulls and helping beat the press, a particularly important attribute in the Premier League.  During the U21 Euros, the centre-back also showed his ability when out of possession with his wonderful reading of the game and sensing of danger. His strength and stature stood out, and in the final itself against Spain he was one of the team's star performers. Obviously, any club interested in signing Colwill will be paying for potential with the 20-year-old still far from the finished article. However, he has solid foundations on which to build and could be a key man for club and country for years to come. Club Appearances Passing accuracy Tackles + interceptions Goals + assists Brighton 22 88.2% 23 2 Huddersfield 30 77.8% 88 3 feed Of course, Chelsea are incredibly eager to hold on to Colwill, whose contract runs until 2025 at Stamford Bridge.  Pochettino views the defender as a key player for Chelsea now and in the future and the club do not want to lose yet another top English academy graduate. The Blues' unwillingness to sell has resulted in the club whacking an approximately Â£68m price tag on their starlet, a fee which is likely to put off any prospective bidders.  Brighton have already seen one bid rejected and are expected to up their offer again, although it will almost certainly not be enough to convince Chelsea to sell. The fact that the Seagulls are so keen on Colwill having seen his progress first-hand last season is a good sign for the left-sided centre-back. Liverpool have also entered the race to sign Colwill and are themselves eager to reinforce their defensive line, specifically looking for a young left-footed centre-back capable of covering in a back three. Colwill ticks all the boxes for the Reds but that enormous price tag will likely prove a stumbling block for Jurgen Klopp's side. While the strongest possibility is Colwill continuing at Chelsea, talks with Pochettino may prove crucial in the youngster's decision."
Why would Man Utd want Rasmus Hojlund?,"Jul 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/why-would-man-utd-want-rasmus-hojlund,"Having only signed for Atalanta from Sturm Graz in Austria last summer, Hojlund's rise in Bergamo has been meteoric. Arriving from relative obscurity, the 20-year-old continually wowed in Serie A and now has one of the biggest clubs in world football knocking at his door. That club is Manchester United, whose frantic search for a new striker this summer has seen them barking up many different trees already. Now one of the names at the forefront of the Red Devils' search, the Dane wants to move to Old Trafford, but there is still talking to be done between the clubs. Why are Atalanta slapping such a hefty price tag on Hojlund and why do United want him so badly? Following Cristiano Ronaldo's mid-season exit from Old Trafford last year, Erik ten Hag was left with very few options up top.  Marcus Rashford was in fine goalscoring form but was far more prolific cutting in from the left-hand side, while the emergency loan of Wout Weghorst and the consistent injuries to Anthony Martial leave the Red Devils without a genuine focal point - Jadon Sancho was even used as a 'false nine' as United commended their pre-season schedule against Leeds in Oslo. Ten Hag needs to remedy this issue during the transfer window and Hojlund could be the man he turns to.  The 20-year-old is understandably inexperienced but impressed in the 32 games he played at Atalanta last season in Serie A. He contributed nine goals and four assists, all while having to share minutes with the more senior Luis Muriel and Duvan Zapata. Standing at 6ft2in, Hojlund is a strong physical presence despite his tender age and teams pace with strength to great effect. His tally of six goals in six games with Denmark also highlights his clinical edge, but the most exciting aspect is still largely his potential. The former FC Kobenhavn player has plenty of room to improve and provides Ten Hag with more of a development project than the likes of Dusan Vlahovic and Victor Osimhen. However, the reward could be significantly greater in the long run. Club Appearances Goals Assists Atalanta 34 10 4 Sturm Graz 21 12 4 FC Kobenhavn 32 5 0 Denmark 6 6 0 feed 90min understands that United have been in talks with Atalanta over a deal for Hojlund, but there is still a considerable gulf between what the Red Devils are willing to pay and what La Dea want. United want to pay no more than Â£51m at a push for Hojlund, while Atalanta are wanting Â£60m or more. Hojlund is keen on a move to Old Trafford as he sets his sights on Champions League and Premier League football next season and may have to force his way out of the Stadio Atleti Azzurri d'Italia.  Ideally, United would like to add two number nines this summer - a young prospect with huge potential and a more experienced forward. Hojlund would tick the box of the former, but budgetary concerns mean signing both attackers may not be possible. "
Paris Saint-Germain interested in signing Joao Felix,"Jul 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/paris-saint-germain-interested-in-signing-joao-felix,"Felix began pre-season training back at Atletico Madrid this week, and in a meeting with club officials he confirmed that he is keen to leave the club this summer. 90min understands that Felix is particularly keen on a move to Paris Saint-Germain in order to work with new manager Luis Enrique.  Enrique has just arrived at the Parc des Princes, replacing Christophe Galtier, and sources have confirmed that he has shortlisted Felix as a potential summer signing for the Ligue 1 champions.  As it stands, Atletico Madrid are demanding around â¬90m for the forward's services, having paid more than â¬120m to sign him from Benfica in 2019. 90min understands that PSG would prefer a loan deal, ideally with an option to buy, but Atleti would want an obligation to buy attached.  feed Felix spent the second half of last season on loan at Chelsea - a loan which did not include an obligation to buy - and the club opted not to take up the opportunity to sign the Portuguese forward outright as he did not fit in with new manager Mauricio Pochettino's plans at Stamford Bridge.  Other English clubs have been linked and 90min understands that Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Newcastle United and Aston Villa have all been kept informed about Felix's situation by his representatives, however another loan to the Premier League is unlikely at this stage.  Felix's fellow countryman Bernardo Silva has also been heavily linked with a move to PSG, with 90min reported recently that the club are set to make a new bid for the Man City man now that Enrique has been appointed.

The 10 most expensive Spanish footballers of all time,"Jul 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/10-most-expensive-spanish-footballers-all-time,"Now, this list may come across as a condemnation of the Blues' transfer policy, but we promise you it's not. Chelsea's penchant for erroneously spending big money on Spanish folk is just a by-product of the top ten most expensive Spaniards of all time. Did we mention that Chelsea dominate this list? Clearly the tapas wasn't authentic enough for Mata around Stamford Bridge as he switched Chelsea for Man Utd midway through the 2013/14 campaign.The archetypal #10 was a fully fledged Premier League star and a Champions League winner with the Blues, but he opted for a new challenge which eventually returned silverware after an underwhelming start.Mata, then United's record signing, spent eight years in Manchester and came ever so close to racking up 200 Premier League appearances with the Red Devils. The Valencia maestro was one of numerous big-money signings made by Lazio during Sergio Cragnotti's ownership.Mendieta became the sixth most expensive player ever in 2002 when the arrived in the Eternal City, but his sole season at Lazio proved a disappointment. The Spaniard was outshone by the likes of Pavel Nedved and Juan Sebastian Veron and was loaned out for the next two seasons before joining Middlesbrough in 2004.Now that's a fall from grace. A transfer which came somewhat out of the blue. Ferran was seemingly only at the start of his journey with Manchester City but the Citizens opted to cut his time in the Premier League short when Barcelona came calling and signed the versatile wide man for â¬55m.City made a tidy profit on the Spaniard, who's failed to cement himself as a regular starter in Catalonia. It's not the first time we'll question Chelsea's recruitment on this list.Torres at his very best was a force to be reckoned with, but that headband donning phenom who terrorised defences at the start of his Premier League career was no more by the time the Blues splurged â¬58.5m to sign him from Liverpool.Sapped of pace and often low on confidence, Torres was not the striker Chelsea thought they were signing. Nevertheless, the Spaniard scored 45 times in 175 games for the Blues and produced one of the sport's most iconic moments at Camp Nou during Chelsea's journey to unthinkable Champions League glory in 2012. Costa was nothing short of a menace during his Chelsea pomp and was the club's leading man (Eden Hazard aside) in two Premier League title triumphs.Antonio Conte initially got the very best out of the tempestuous forward during his first season at the helm, but their combustible relationship unsurprisingly culminated in a divorce.A delayed transfer meant Costa eventually returned to Atletico for â¬60m in January 2018. feed The Basque Country tax. City were forced to pay a whopping â¬65m to sign Laporte from Athletic Club in 2018.However, the club's hefty investment proved shrewd as Laporte quickly settled in Manchester and proved a crucial addition to Pep's project.His ball-playing capacity elevated City's build-up and helped them to multiple league titles, although his prominence at the Etihad waned during their treble-winning 2022/23 campaign. Cucurella has come a long way from being Jose Borderlas' Duracell bunny down Getafe's left flank.Brighton proved to be the perfect destination for the spritely Spaniard, who rapidly evolved into a full-back coveted by City and Chelsea. The Blues won the bidding war, paying a eye-watering â¬65.3m to bring him to Stamford Bridge.While Cucurella had impressed on the south coast, almost everybody believed Chelsea had overpaid the odds and those doubts were vindicated as the versatile defender endured a tough debut season. While Conte insisted Morata was a man you'd like your daughter to marry, the Italian wasn't particularly pleased that the Spaniard ended up as his leading man following Diego Costa's exit.Conte was desperate for Romelu Lukaku, but the Blues missed out as United acquired the Belgian.Morata was regarded as a fine alternative nonetheless and his maiden season at the club was pretty impressive. However, the Spaniard's form quickly fell off a cliff and he struggled to regain any sort of confidence once self-doubt started to arise. City were proactive in their search for Fernandinho's successor, acquiring a midfielder more out of the Pep Guardiola mould.The Citizens signed Rodri from Atletico Madrid for â¬70m in 2020 and the Spaniard quickly grew into one of Pep's lynchpins.Rodri has long been regarded as one of the very best in his position and his excellent 2022/23 campaign concluded with the winner in the Champions League final. Remember that pesky Basque Country tax.Chelsea not only made Kepa the most expensive Spaniard ever when they signed him from Athletic Club in 2018, but he also became the most expensive goalkeeper ever. The mammoth fee meant it was always going to be hard for Kepa to live up to expectations and he's endured some really tough spells in west London. For a while it seemed as if his Premier League career was up, but a recent resurgence saw him reclaim his number one status from Edouard Mendy. A decent enough keeper who was never worth the monster sum paid by the Blues.  Rank Player Joined Fee 1. Kepa Arrizabalaga Chelsea â¬80m 2. Rodri Man City â¬70m 3. Alvaro Morata Chelsea â¬66m 4.

Joan Laporta reveals Barcelona's plans for new signing Vitor Roque,"Jul 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/joan-laporta-barcelona-plans-new-signing-vitor-roque,"La Blaugrana confirmed the â¬40m signing of Roque from Athletico Paranaense on Wednesday, fending off interest from the likes of Arsenal, Chelsea and Bayern Munich in order to secure the highly-rated youngster's signature.  The 18-year-old has signed a long-term deal at the club but will remain at Paranaense until 2024, something which was confirmed by president Laporta during an interview with Mundo Deportivo. ""We have this feasibility plan and it is scheduled for January or June unless the foreseen circumstances improve, although they could still occur,"" Laporta said. feed Laporta also revealed what he expectes of Roque, who recently became Brazil's youngest ever player - beating a record previously held by Ronaldo. ""Goals.Â It is a very own style.Â You can't compare it to Ronaldo or Romario, he is a player who gets into the penalty box and can shoot with both feet anywhere inside that area,"" he added. ""I can't say that he is a Romario because he plays differently than a Romario, which was from a cartoon.Â He has a lot of power and although he is very young, he can be compared to Ronaldo, who we had with a spectacular force of nature.Â He is powerful and he is Brazilian."""
Man City players who could leave before the transfer window deadline,"Jul 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-city-players-could-leave-transfer-window-deadline-2023,"However, for the good of competitive football, it might be a blessing if some of City's stars make an exit in the transfer window. Ilkay Gundogan has already left for Barcelona, while a host of Guardiola's other stalwarts have been rumoured with transfers elsewhere. The departures of Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko to Arsenal last summer also proved costly in City's pursuit of the Premier League and Pep will be keen not to give any of his other rivals a leg-up this time around. Here are some of those who could leave the Cityzens this transfer window. One of those who has missed out on the plaudits received by City's treble-winners is Joao Cancelo. The 29-year-old left the Etihad halfway through last season to join Bayern Munich on loan after falling out with Guardiola. Having made 17 Premier League appearances and appeared in every Champions League group stage match for the Sky Blues, Cancelo may regret his decision to depart City in the middle of a historic season in Manchester. Having been met by a chorus of boos by Man City supporters when his Bayern side faced the Sky Blues in the Champions League quarter-final, it appears there is no way back for the once invincible Portuguese defender. While Bayern have had the option to make Cancelo's deal permanent for approximately Â£60m, the Bavarians passed up on the opportunity due to what they consider an excessive fee. However, Die Roten remain a club acutely interested in a deal for the full back but will have to barter to get a transfer over the line. Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta also holds Cancelo in high-regard having worked with him during his time at Man City, but given the positive impact of Jesus and Zinchenko at the Emirates last season, Guardiola may think twice before letting him move to north London. Barcelona are also sniffing around having already captured his former teammate Gundogan, but their financial problems would make a deal difficult to complete. Cancelo is not the only full back Bayern are interested in, with last season's Bundesliga champions also eager to sign Walker. The 33-year-old impressed last season, albeit his minutes were more closely managed, and his pace has been crucial in breaking up opposition counter-attacks with John Stones stepping into midfield. His impressive performance against Vinicius Junior in the Champions League semi-final second leg highlights how capable he remains at the highest level. With his contract set to expire next summer, City are keen to extend his current deal despite the fact that Walker is yet to make a final decision on whether he wants to stay at the Etihad. Bayern have been forthright in their attempts to woo Walker this summer as Thomas Tuchel seeks a replacement for the departing Benjamin Pavard and the England international may be keen on a change of scenery having won almost everything there is to win at City. Similarly to Cancelo, Laporte was once seen as an immovable object in the City starting lineup. His absence was so greatly felt during the 2019/20 season when his injury early in the campaign resulted in a significant drop-off in performances for the Sky Blues, helping Liverpool leapfrog City to the Premier League title. However, Laporte is now something of a luxury option for Guardiola as Nathan Ake's sensational performances have cost the Spain international his starting berth. The potential arrival of another left-sided centre-back in Josko Gvardiol from RB Leipzig could well and truly push Laporte out the exit door. 90min have already reported that, following conversations with Guardiola about a lack of game time, Laporte is now looking for a move away from the Etihad this summer. Barcelona, who are seemingly the first in line for any discontented City player, hold an interest in the 29-year-old while there are unsurprisingly suitors from Saudi Arabia. Having sealed a dream Â£45m move from Leeds United last summer, things quickly turned nightmarish for Phillips at City. The holding midfielder missed a large chunk of the campaign through injury last year and was even criticised by Guardiola for being overweight. As a result, the 27-year-old made just 21 appearances in all competitions, most of which came from the bench, and the curtain may already be closing on his disappointing City career. Guardiola is still undecided about what to do with Phillips but given the significant transfer fee City spent on the midfielder, it may be a rare example of when the club's recruitment team get it wrong. West Ham and Newcastle have been linked with a potential move and it feels as if a transfer may come later in the window. feed One man who Guardiola would be loathed to lose is Bernardo Silva, a man for whom the big occasion is his playground. His sensational performance in Man City's 4-0 victory over Real Madrid last season was one of the highlights of the campaign, scoring twice and giving Eduardo Camavinga nightmares. The 28-year-old is one of Guardiola's key foot soldiers and his loss would be sorely felt by the Sky Blues should he depart. Paris Saint-Germain's new coach Luis Enrique is eager to work with the attacking midfielder, while there has also been significant interest from Saudi Arabia. Unsurprisingly, Barcelona also have a long-standing admiration of Silva with City only willing to accept sizeable offers for the Portugal international. Silva has made 306 appearances over a trophy-laden six-year career at the Etihad. Despite his slightly waning influence on Man City, now normally being reserved for more simplistic fixtures, Mahrez still managed 28 combined goals and assists in 47 games last season. On his day, he remains borderline unplayable. Knowing he is going to cut in on his wand of a left foot and unleash a powerful drive is one thing, stopping it is another thing altogether. His consistency and quality is unquestionable, but this may be the last summer in which the Sky Blues can recoup a significant amount of money for the 32-year-old before his value diminishes. Despite growing lucrative interest from Saudi Arabia, 90min understands  City are still desperate to keep hold of the Algerian winger this summer, especially if Silva departs. Without an obvious replacement for his unique skill set, Mahrez's exit would pose Guardiola a serious headache."
Ruben Loftus-Cheek reveals why he left Chelsea,"Jul 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ruben-loftus-cheek-reveals-why-he-left-chelsea,"The towering midfielder ended his near 20-year association with Chelsea - having joined the youth team in 2004 - at the end of the 2022/23 season following the expiration of his contract at Stamford Bridge. Loftus-Cheek has signed a four-year deal with Milan, with the midfielder seemingly set to replace Sandro Tonali in Stefano Pioli's starting XI after he joined Newcastle United for an Italian record fee earlier this month.  feed Speaking to the press at his unveiling as a Milan player, Loftus-Cheek admitted that decided to leave the Blues due to the lack of playing time in his preferred position in midfield. ""I love the club and the fans but I wasn't feeling content with the amount I was playing and the positions I was playing in,"" he said. ""I felt I had more to give but I wasn't getting the opportunity. I feel good physically and am playing some really good football. It was a good time to move on."" The 27-year-old made 25 appearances for Chelsea during the 2022/23 campaign, with just 11 of those coming as a central midfielder. Loftus-Cheek was more regularly utilised as a right wing-back, playing that position on 14 occasions. "

They have now confirmed Torres as their second signing of the summer, following on from Youri Tielemans' free transfer from Leicester City. feed 90min first reported at the start of June that Torres was of interest to Villa, as well as Manchester City's Aymeric Laporte. Negotiations advanced throughout the following weeks and an agreement was reached on the final day of the month, with the Spain international granted permission to travel for a medical. Torres' move was confirmed on Wednesday after returning from his honeymoon. Villa have further plans to bring in a winger this window, but have failed in their attempts to sign Nico Williams from Athletic Club and are struggling to persuade Ferran Torres to leave Barcelona."
Fulham determined to keep Aleksandar Mitrovic & Marco Silva amid Saudi Arabia interest,"Jul 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/fulham-determined-keep-aleksandar-mitrovic-marco-silva-saudi-arabia-interest,"Mitrovic proved many doubters wrong last season upon his return to the Premier League, finishing the campaign with 14 goals in 24 games. The Serbia international is contracted to Fulham until 2026 and just as is the case with Portugal midfielder Joao Palhinha, the west London outfit are not planning on losing their prized assets. 90min understands an opening offer has arrived from Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal, who tabled an initial bid worth Â£25m. But sources close to Fulham insist Mitorvic is not for sale and the bid was quickly rebuffed. It remains to be seen if Al Hilal will try again, with sources telling 90min the 28-year-old does want to move to Saudi Arabia where he has been offered a three-year deal worth more than Â£20m per season. feed 90min understands that Al Ahli also have an interest in Mitrovic, but Al Hilal are seen as the most likely option given they already have a deal in place to sign his good friend Sergej Milinkovic-Savic. While Fulham are adamant that Mitrovic will not be leaving, they are also continuing to try and persuade manager Marco Silva to reject advances from the Saudi Pro League. Silva has already rebuffed an offer earlier this summer this to move to Saudi Arabia, but 90min can confirm that efforts are still being made to land the Portuguese coach. His current deal expires in 2024 and Fulham are working hard to convince Silva to sign a new deal, but they know they are unable to hand him the kind of money on offer from Saudi Arabia. Al Ahli are believed to be the side eyeing Silva."
The 10 most expensive German footballers of all time,"Jul 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/10-most-expensive-german-footballers-all-time,"While Bayern Munich have tried their utmost to acquire and retain the very best Germany has to offer amid their supreme reign at the Bundesliga summit, the financial might of the English top flight has seen several players escape Die Roten's grasp. Of the ten most expensive German players of all time, six signed for Premier League clubs, while all but two have at some point in their careers strutted their stuff on English shores. Pep Guardiola made Borussia Dortmund sensation Gotze one of his first signings as Bayern boss, with the Spaniard believing the young German could develop into a majestic false nine.Gotze starred in Pep's maiden season and enjoyed a productive year two before a hamstring injury compromised his third campaign at the club. While the canny midfielder's record at Bayern was pretty impressive, he departed after three years with the prevailing feeling of 'what could've been'. PSG were so convinced by young Kehrer that they splashed out â¬37m to prise him away from Schalke, where he burst onto the scene as a teenager.The defender certainly impressed in spells at Parc des Princes as he spent four years in the French capital but his eventual sale to West Ham for â¬12m shows he didn't quite live up to the hype. There was a time when Arsenal weren't so savvy in the transfer market.While â¬41m isn't such a mammoth fee in 2023, it was significant back in 2016 when the Gunners moved for Valencia centre-back Mustafi.The 2014 World Cup winner arrived with a rather lofty reputation but his time in north London was tumultuous. Mustafi was capable of producing stellar performances against the world's best but his frequent brain fades rendered him a liability in Arsenal's backline.Nevertheless, he spent five years at the Emirates and notched over 100 Premier League appearances. Once a highly rated young Germany international, Julian Draxler's peak years have come and gone in sad fashion.Once coveted for years by Europe's elite, the precocious German playmaker's big move in 2015 wasn't overseas. He remained in the Bundesliga and signed for a Wolfsburg side seemingly on the come up after qualifying for the Champions League.Tasked with replacing Kevin De Bruyne, Draxler's 2015/16 season was by no means a disaster but many in the German media believed he failed to fulfil expectations as Wolfsburg slumped to eighth in the Bundesliga. feed Arsenal fans were the envy of the footballing world at the end of the 2013 summer transfer window. The day after Olivier Giroud scored the game's only goal to beat Tottenham in the north London derby, Real Madrid superstar Ozil was announced as a deadline day arrival.The once-in-a-generation playmaker arrived to much fanfare after excelling on the world stage at the 2010 World Cup and thrived under Jose Mourinho in the Spanish capital.Ozil was the most expensive German player ever for a few years before being overtaken. While Sane had blossomed into a frightening prospect for Premier League full backs at Man City, Bayern were undoubtedly taking a bit of a risk by signing the winger for a pretty big fee in 2020.Sane's contract situation and his long-term injury setback meant Bayern snagged him for a bargain given his value pre-injury but it took a while for the former Schalke starlet to find his feet in Bavaria.The destructive Sane that was instrumental in City's majestic 2017/18 and 2018/19 campaigns is yet to manifest consistently for the Rekordmeister. Sane joined City during Guardiola's first summer at the club and it didn't take the German long to establish himself as a protagonist in the Spaniard's project.He burst into life after a quiet debut season (reportedly hampered by a breathing issue) and starred as City became the Premier League's first centurions in 2017/18.The winger forged devastating relationships with Raheem Sterling on the opposite flank and Sergio Aguero up top, with his lightning-quick speed and direct running persistently overwhelming opposing full backs.Sane notched 47 Premier League goal contributions in 17/18 and 18/19. Seemingly destined for Liverpool after yet another marvellous season with RB Leipzig, Chelsea swooped under the Reds' nose to sign Werner ahead of the 2020/21 season.The rapid German forward was an output machine in his homeland but his woeful inefficiency meant his time in west London was a forgettable one.While a loveable figure and a Champions League winner with the Blues, Werner scored just ten Premier League goals in 56 games. New surroundings ð´âªï¸Kai Havertz at Emirates Stadium â¡ï¸ pic.twitter.com/KLTgAn6EhW A move that's raised plenty of eyebrows but you'd be silly to doubt Mikel Arteta given Arsenal's recent record on the recruitment front. While Havertz has done little in the Premier League to suggest he's worth the monster pay packet Arsenal are offering him, Arteta must be confident he can help the Germany international rediscover his potent Bayer Leverkusen touch.Arteta has already hinted Havertz's future in north London lies in midfield as the potential replacement for Granit Xhaka as the Spaniard's left-sided #8.It's a role that should get the best out of the languid space invader. It takes a lot to garner praise from former World Footballer of the Year Lothar Matthaus but Der Panzer was full of praise for blossoming Leverkusen starlet Havertz back in 2019.Matthaus labelled Havertz a future Ballon d'Or winner and later compared him to Zinedine Zidane. While such lofty praise was rational at the time, the player's time at Chelsea rendered Matthaus' projections laughable.Havertz became the most expensive German ever when Chelsea signed him off the back of a stellar Bundesliga career for â¬80m in 2020. And while he'd score the game's only goal in the 2021 Champions League final, Havertz's Chelsea career is looked upon with indifference given his inconsistency and apparent flakiness.

He is open to such a move. As was the case last month though, Man City remain reluctant to let Mahrez leave, with Bernardo Silva's increasingly uncertain future a major factor. The Portugal international has asked to be granted a summer transfer and PSG are keen to make him one of Luis Enrique's first signings. Another player that is on Saudi Arabia's radar is out-of-favour Man City centre-back Aymeric Laporte. 90min previously reported that Laporte was being eyed by Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur, but Man City have not received any major offers from clubs in Europe. With interest from across the continent yet to be firmed up, Man City are ready to sell him to willing buyers from Saudi Arabia, with Al Ahli ready to offer him an exit route.

Liverpool ready to make move for Levi Colwill,"Jul 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-ready-to-make-move-levi-colwill,"Sources have confirmed to 90min that Liverpool are confident they can lure Colwill away from Stamford Bridge, despite Chelsea's insistence that he is not for sale.

Kane's contract expires in 2024 and he has so far resisted signing a fresh deal at Tottenham following their worst Premier League finish in 14 years. 90min reported on Sunday that Bayern followed up on their initial offer for Kane with a second bid of â¬80m - the same amount they spent on club-record signing Lucas Hernandez back in 2019. However, Tottenham stood firm and knocked it back. Sources have confirmed to 90min that this has not deterred Bayern and they are now ready to smash their transfer record in order to bring Kane to the Allianz Arena, with a third bid to be submitted in the coming days. Nevertheless, Tottenham are adamant that they will not even entertain talk of a deal for Kane and they are likely to reject any further advances from Bayern. Spurs' new head coach, Ange Postecoglou, will meet with Kane for the first time on Wednesday when he returns to Hotspur Way for pre-season training. feed 90min understands that Tottenham are hopeful that Kane will buy into Postecoglou's plans for a rebuild and help convince him to extend his stay at the club. Speaking at his introductory press conference on Monday, Postecoglou admitted he is currently unconcerned by talk of Kane leaving the club. ""If I say itâs annoying me, it would be misleading - it doesnât register. I always believe that yo'âre much better trying to understand what a situation is through your own eyes,"" Postecoglou said. ""In my head right now, Harry's on holiday, he's on a sun-bed and playing with his family and having a great time. That's the picture I've got. ""Now, if other things are going on I'm not going to think about it and the reason I don't is because he'll be here in two days' time [Wednesday] and everything I need to know will be sitting right in front of me. ""So in the meantime, I'm not going to lose time or sleep on conjecture because then you're jumping at shadows - how much of it is true, how much of it is not true? ""Nothing's landed on my desk at this moment from anybody at the club to say there's a decision to be made there. Not even close to that, so because of that I'm looking forward to having Harry here on Wednesday.""

Harry is already an important figure in the history of this football club. He's one of the premier players in the world. I want him here and I want to make this club successful. I'm certain he wants that as well. ""It's not going to be a conversation where we come out with some kind of understanding.

Asked why Barcelona accepted defeat, Laporta insisted the La Liga champions are no longer prepared to pay over the odds for any player, having done so to a damaging extent under the previous president, Josep Maria Bartomeu. ""We have to apply common sense and we think that we should move away from this operation due to the magnitude of it,"" Laporta told SPORT. ""We had an agreement with the club for â¬17.5m. We also agreed with the player. Madrid has entered and considered that they had to pay the amounts that they have paid. We then thought that we did not have to continue. There are more players that I think we can get without entering this battle. We thought it would be a mistake on our part. feed ""We could have come to compete [but]... we self-impose criteria that we are not going to transgress."" Laporta later confirmed that Barcelona's stance was designed to ensure they 'do not go back there', referring to the period of financial woes brought about under Bartomeu. Barcelona are in the market for a number of reinforcements this summer and, when asked how they could spend the money initially set aside for Guler, Laporta confirmed that manager Xavi has made his demands perfectly clear. ""As the coach has requested, a right-back and two midfielders are missing,"" he explained. ""I don't think it's going to cost us much. In fact, there are several possibilities, several options. Xavi has told us that he can now compete but we do have to look for a player to occupy the place left by Busi [Sergio Busquets] and to be able to play in a two."""

However, sources have confirmed to 90min that City are delighted with Alvarez's impact and are not entertaining losing him this summer, either permanently or temporarily, while the World Cup winner is also understood to be happy at the club. Alvarez's feelings towards his situation at City were made clear in March, when he signed a new five-year contract, and there remains a mutual desire to continue working together at the Etihad. feed City are braced for the possible departures of both Bernardo Silva and Riyad Mahrez this summer. The former is wanted by both Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain, while the latter is of significant interest in Saudi Arabia. Amid concerns about a potential shake-up of their forward line, City are not prepared to part ways with Alvarez and sources have stressed to 90min that this stance was taken well before interest in Silva and Mahrez emerged. Bayern Munich have been made well aware that there is no chance of signing Alvarez this summer and, with a move for Tottenham's Harry Kane also a non-starter, the German champions have begun searching elsewhere.

Napoli president claims only one club can afford Victor Osimhen,"Jul 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/napoli-president-claims-only-one-club-can-afford-victor-osimhen,"Napoli took a punt on a 21-year-old Osimhen in 2020 after the Nigerian had spent just a single season with Lille and completed only his second full campaign as a first-team player anywhere. But they have been repaid handsomely for their investment, â¬70m rising to â¬80m, seeing Osimhen score 28 goals across his first two seasons and then hit 31 in his third alone. As many as 26 of those goals came in Serie A as Napoli collected a first Scudetto in 33 years last season. But Osimhen's starring role has brought him to the attention of some of Europe's biggest spenders, with Chelsea, Manchester United and Real Madrid all in need of a new 'number nine'. De Laurentiis, known all over world football as a tough negotiator, has been pretty consistent in his message throughout the ongoing transfer saga â the idea that Osimhen is only for sale in the event of a monstrous bid. feed Already this week, the president suggested that Osimhen will be staying put unless a 'more than indecent proposal' arrives at his door. In that scenario, Napoli would have no issue cashing in and searching for their next gem to polish, something they seem to have an outstanding knack for. 90min understands that Napoli value Osimhen at â¬150m and that no club is currently willing to meet that asking price. Publicly, however, De Laurentiis is setting his valuation even higher, and claims that only Paris Saint-Germain have the financial power to get a deal done. Manchester United are known to be operating on a budget with limitations and have already spent big on Mason Mount, with Andre Onana soon also expected to arrive for another big fee. Similarly, Real Madrid have committed up to â¬134m on Jude Bellingham, while Chelsea are watching the pennies more carefully than last season and are selling as many players as they buy. ""The only club that could afford Victor Osimhen is Paris Saint-Germain,"" De Laurentiis told Mediaset in Italy. ""If [PSG president] Nasser Al Khelaifi wants to send in a bid around â¬200mâ¦we wait and we see what happens. I personally think that Victor will stay here."""
Moises Caicedo admits he 'cannot say no' to Chelsea transfer,"Jul 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/moises-caicedo-admits-he-cannot-say-no-to-chelsea-transfer,"Caicedo is the Blues' top target to replenish their midfield following the summer departures of Mason Mount, Mateo Kovacic, N'Golo Kante and Ruben Loftus-Cheek, and the Blues have long been in talks with Brighton over a summer deal. The sticking point has been Brighton's price tag of Â£100m which was drawn from Declan Rice's imminent move to Arsenal. The West Ham midfielder has commanded a fee of Â£105m and Brighton do not believe Caicedo should be much cheaper. Negotiations between the two clubs have proven difficult but Chelsea would seemingly not face the same difficulties in talks with Caicedo, who conceded he would be unable to turn the Blues down this summer. ""It's a big team, that's true,"" he told Maria Jose Flores when asked about Chelsea's interest. ""A very historic team and I can't say no, because it's a very big, historic, beautiful team.  ""The city as well is beautiful. It's got everything beautiful."" feed Brighton have expressed an interest in seeing Chelsea offer centre-back Levi Colwill as part of any bid for Caicedo but the Blues have made it abundantly clear that they are not entertaining such an idea. Colwill shone last season on loan at Brighton and the Seagulls are one of a number of sides to have enquired about his availability this summer, including both Liverpool and Manchester City, but Chelsea's stance has always been the same. Colwill is due to report back for pre-season with Chelsea in the coming days and will speak with manager Mauricio Pochettino about his future at the club, having spoken openly during the summer about his desire to see regular minutes next season. ""Iâve got to play at the end of the day,"" he told reporters after his triumphant European campaign with England Under-21s. Chelsea have a number of midfielders on their radar this summer but are currently focused on Caicedo, although club officials have not yet ruled out a move for a second midfielder as well."
Fred considering Man Utd future amid interest from Fulham & Saudi Pro League,"Jul 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/fred-man-utd-future-interest-fulham-saudi-pro-league,"The Brazilian midfielder joined United in June 2018 but fell out of favour under current manager Erik ten Hag in the final months of last season, starting only two Premier League matches under the Dutchman in the aftermath of the team's 7-0 defeat to Liverpool at Anfield. United's signing of Mason Mount this month has pushed Fred, now 30, further down the pecking order and he is weighing up his options with a regular first team place likely hard to come by in the new campaign. Ten Hag would also ideally like to sign another midfielder before the transfer window closes, with Fiorentina's Sofyan Amrabat of interest. Fred is understood by 90min not to be in United's long-term plans, and the club are willing to let him leave for the right price during this transfer window. United are hopeful they can recoup between Â£20m-Â£25m in any potential sale, and are asking for towards the top end of that price range as it stands. Fulham are interested, but value Fred at under Â£15m - far below United's current valuation. The player was seen speaking to Fulham manager Marco Silva outside Old Trafford following the final league fixture of last season, where the two sides met. Fred has recently changed agents and has other options to leave - with clubs in the Saudi Pro League potential candidates to sign him as they continue to sweep up high-profile players from across Europe. Fred's former United teammate Paul Pogba is of strong interest to Al Ahli and Al Ittihad, where N'Golo Kante and Karim Benzema are among the primary names to have already made the move. Jose Mourinho's Roma are understood to have spoken with Fred's representatives - Mourinho signed Fred at United during his spell as manager - though the 30-year-old has yet to make a decision on where to play next. feed It's understood Fred believes he can still play a part in United's team for the season ahead, and is also considering staying for another year and leaving on a free transfer in 2024, when his contract expires. Conversations with Ten Hag are expected to take place during pre-season and Fred has been named in a travelling squad to Norway for United's first pre-season fixture against Leeds on Wednesday. Fred's long-time midfield partner Scott McTominay is not in United's long-term plans either, though as it stands his options to leave United this summer are dwindling.  Brighton and Newcastle United, once keen on the Scotland international, have cooled their interest, while 90min has learned he does not currently feature high on the list of David Moyes' West Ham - who are set to confirm the Â£105m departure of club captain and midfielder Declan Rice to Arsenal in the coming days. Mourinho's Roma are monitoring the 26-year-old too but are unlikely at best to get anywhere near the price United would be looking for in any permanent sale.

Franck Kessie open to Barcelona exit amid Serie A & Saudi Pro League interest,"Jul 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/franck-kessie-barcelona-exit-serie-a-saudi-pro-league-interest,"The 26-year-old moved to Camp Nou on a four-year deal last summer, arriving from AC Milan following the expiry of his contract. Kessie became one of Milan's most influential players in his final two seasons at the club, scoring 13 Serie A goals in 2020/21 before winning the title in 2021/22, but has struggled to make the same impact in Spain. The Ivorian did score perhaps the most important goal of Barca's season - a title-deciding winner against Real Madrid - but made just seven starts in La Liga as Pedri, Frenkie de Jong and Sergio Busquets made it difficult for him to command a regular first-team place. 90min revealed in December that Kessie had already started to generate interest, but neither he or the club were interested in sanctioning an exit at that time. But with Barcelona still looking to offload players to lighten their inflated wage bill, speculation around Kessie's future has failed to die down. feed Sources have confirmed to 90min that Kessie would now be open to leaving Barca this summer, with interest in his services mounting from former club Milan, neighbourhood rivals Inter and Juventus. Serie A title holders Napoli are also keeping apprised of Kessie's situation, while there's also interest from the Saudi Pro League as well as in the Premier League. Barcelona's preference would be sell to Kessie permanently, rather than allowing him to go out on loan, which may work out favourably for the interested clubs in Saudi Arabia. The league has spent  lavishly on players this summer - PIF-backed Al Ittihad, Al Nassr, Al Alhi and Al Hilal the main landing spots - with Paul Pogba and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic the latest marquee names on the radar. As for Barcelona, they've already released Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba and Samuel Umtiti from their contracts, but president Joan Laporta is also looking to sell other first team players. Winger Ferran Torres is a leading candidate to head for the exit door, but the 23-year-old is determined to stay at the club this summer despite interest from Arsenal, Aston Villa and Newcastle."

But regardless of whether a move materialises or not, Sambi Lokonga insisted his absence from training was purely down to fitness.

Chelsea among Premier League clubs taking interest in Ibrahim Adel,"Jul 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-premier-league-clubs-interest-ibrahim-adel,"The 22-year-old has long been regarded as one of African football's brightest young talents, and backed up that reputation after being named Player of the Tournament at the recent Under-23 Africa Cup of Nations. Adel, who currently plays for Pyramids in his homeland and has been capped four times by Egypt's senior team, was targeted by Belgian giants Anderlecht earlier this year, but a number of Premier League clubs have also been monitoring his progress. Indeed, 90min revealed in September last year that fellow countryman Mohamed Salah had advised Liverpool to keep an eye on Adel's development, though any move to England was off the table at the time because of issues obtaining a work permit. feed However, post-Brexit regulations adopted by the FA this summer means that Adel, or any other player, does not need to meet the former points threshold set by the Governing Body Endorsement criteria. Instead, up to two players - who previously would not have qualified for a work permit - can be signed, and in future years up to four players can arrive in one season depending on how many homegrown players a club has used. Adel's new found eligibility is understood to have piqued the interest of a number of Premier League and Championship clubs, with sources telling 90min that Chelsea and Newcastle are among those to have expressed an interest, alongside Brighton, Brentford, Aston Villa, West Ham, Burnley and Southampton. Chelsea's interest is believed to emanate from BlueCo - the new parent company that will oversee  their multi club structure - and a potential loan deal involving Strasbourg. The Blues have history of signing emerging Egyptian talent having signed Salah from Basel in 2014. 90min understands there's also interest in Adel from France, Spain and Germany, but the Premier League is thought to be the player's preference at this point."
Barcelona at odds with Ferran Torres over summer transfer,"Jul 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-ferran-torres-summer-transfer,"The 23-year-old left Manchester City for a fee just shy of Â£50m in January 2022, but he's struggled to make an impact at Barca in his 18 months at the club. He has scored just 14 goals in 71 appearances all competitions and noticeably fell down Xavi's pecking order last season - evidenced by just 14 La Liga starts during 2022/23. Despite his struggles, Torres has garnered significant interest from the Premier League. 90min revealed in May that Mikel Arteta was keen to take Torres or Barcelona team-mate Raphinha to Arsenal, while Newcastle have also kept a close eye on his situation as they target signing a new wide forward. Unai Emery's Aston Villa have also shown interest in Torres after qualifying for next season's Conference League, but the Spaniard has resisted Villa's interest to date, revealing to local media at the end of June: ""Today, I am at Barca, but football takes many turns. I have the phone on airplane mode, on July 10 [the start of pre-season], I will open it. ""I'm just focused on what's mine, training, taking advantage of the pre-season that I couldn't do last year [due to injury] and from here on, showing that I'm a great footballer. In the next few days you will have news."" feed 90min understands that Torres' stance over a move hasn't changed, despite the club making it clear that he will be behind Raphinha, Ousmane Dembele and Ansu Fati in Xavi's wide forward pecking order, and there's currently no persuading him that moving on is in his best interests. Indeed, the former Valencia academy graduate believes he can earn a place in the side. Barcelona remain in dire financial trouble - which prevented Lionel Messi's fairytale return to the club materialising - and need to raise money this summer through player sales, or simply by clearing players off the wage bill. A loan move for Torres would be sanctioned - something 90min understands would certainly appeal to Aston Villa - but any reasonable offer for the 35-cap Spain international would also be taken. Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba and Samuel Umtiti have already departed Barca on free transfers, though their exits have been partly offset by the arrivals of Ilkay Gundogan and Inigo Martinez, as well as the return of several fringe players from loan spells away."

He was then able to join Fulham on loan due to a ruling by FIFA that allowed foreign players suspend their contracts owing to the ongoing Russian invasion.

Naturally, the Nigeria international is on the transfer radar of other clubs. Chelsea have been firmly targeting Osimhen since February, having already stepped up their scouting presence with regard to the player last autumn. Manchester United are also in the market for a striker, while Real Madrid are additionally linked following the surprise departure of Karim Benzema earlier this summer.

As for Osimhen himself, he recently indicated his willingness to stay at Napoli by saying: ""I am so happy I made the right choice by coming here. And achieving this kind of greatness with the Neapolitans is something that I will wake up and always smile about."""

Tottenham continuing Edmond Tapsoba and Micky van de Ven talks,"Jul 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-edmond-tapsoba-micky-van-de-ven-talks,"The two central defenders have been targeted as Spurs look to put a disappointing 2022/23 campaign firmly in the rear-view mirror - one that saw the club concede 63 goals en route to an eighth place finish in the Premier League, missing out on qualifying for Europe in the process. Spurs, who appointed Ange Postecoglou as their new head coach at the beginning of June, have considered moves for Aymeric Laporte and Max Kilman among others, but have been actively pursuing for Tapsoba and Van de Ven over the past few weeks. 90min previously revealed that Spurs were concerned over rival interest in 24-year-old Tapsoba - Liverpool, Manchester United and Newcastle United among those being kept apprised of his situation - but were progressing talks are learning of his interest in moving to north London. Those talks are still ongoing, with discussions with the player's representatives at an advanced stage, but there's work to do in terms of agreeing a deal with Leverkusen. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Xabi Alonso's side are looking to pocket around â¬50m (Â£42.5m) for Tapsoba - a fee Spurs may ultimately not need to pay if they're able to progress a deal for Van de Ven. feed Wolfsburg value the Dutchman at around â¬40m (Â£34m), though he doesn't yet offer the same level as experience as Tapsoba. Van de Ven does, however, offer Spurs the versatility of being able to play at left-back as well as at centre-back, and he recently represented Netherlands at the Under-21 European Championship. Talks are also at advanced stage with Van de Ven's camp - 90min previously revealed Spurs' confidence of concluding a deal - and discussions are ongoing with Wolfsburg about the proposed fee. It's unclear at this stage whether or not Spurs are prepared to conclude deals for both players, or whether the club are simply putting themselves in a position of strength as pre-season gets underway. Guglielmo Vicario and James Maddison have already arrived at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this summer, while Dejan Kulusevski's loan from Juventus has been turned into a permanent deal."
Sergej Milinkovic-Savic offered huge Saudi Pro League contract,"Jul 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/sergej-milinkovic-savic-offered-huge-saudi-pro-league-contract,"The 28-year-old has been often linked with a move away from Lazio, having spent eight years in the Italian capital establishing himself as one of the finest central midfielders in Serie A. Juventus have been long-term admirers of Milinkovic-Savic, without ever formalising their interest, while Inter also considered him as a potential transfer target before opting for the more reasonably priced Davide Frattesi. Milinkovic-Savic has also been linked with a move to the Premier League on a number of occasions, though 90min understands that links to Arsenal and Newcastle this summer are wide of the mark. Instead, sources have confirmed that Milinkovic-Savic has received an offer from one of the four PIF-backed Saudi Pro League clubs, Al Hilal, which could be worth around Â£20m-a-year - close to 10x times the salary he's currently receiving from Lazio. Talks have been held with the player's representatives over moving to the Middle East, though they are also contacting clubs from around Europe to see if Milinkovic-Savic has any alternative options to consider. manual Lazio for their part have been offered â¬40m to allow Milinkovic-Savic to leave, which sources have told 90min they have verbally agreed to do pending the Serbian's decision. ""I don't think it's a problem of stimuli, if one wants to go to Saudi Arabia the stimulus is only the money,"" Lazio's president, Claudio Lotito, said of Milinkovic-Savic potentially leaving. ""But you have to ask him. I searched until the end to keep him, but if he asks me to leave for his own personal matter, what can I do?  ""We were willing to renew the contract by increasing his salary. I have a good relationship with him, but in the end the player decides what he wants to do in life. Savic phoned me begging me to let him go."" Referencing Al Hilal's bid in particular, he added: ""This offer has not actually arrived and, as long as he is a Lazio player, he will retire. I made a commitment with the boy that if a normal offer were to arrive minimum for Lazio he could go away. The offer is 50 million lower, a little less."" Milinkovic-Savic has been one of the best players in Serie A since joining Lazio from Genk in 2015, scoring 69 goals in 341 appearances en route to winning the Coppa Italia and the Serie A Best Midfielder award in 2019."
Saudi Pro League pushing to make Paul Pogba marquee signing,"Jul 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/saudi-pro-league-paul-pogba-marquee-signing,"The riches of the Middle East have tempted a number of high-profile players into making the switch this summer, including Karim Benzema, N'Golo Kante, Roberto Firmino and Ruben Neves to name just four. More star names are expected to follow in the coming weeks and months, with Saudi Arabia looking to not only improve the quality of their league but also establish a real foothold in the world of football ahead of a bid to host the 2030 FIFA World Cup. Saudi's Public Investment Fund (PIF), who have a controlling interest in Newcastle United, have already poured huge amounts of money into four of the biggest clubs in the country - Al Ittihad, Al Nassr, Al Hilal and Al Ahli - and their intention is to continue attracting the best players in the world. 90min exclusively revealed in early June that Pogba was one of the biggest names on PIF's radar and that remains the case, despite him being limited to just 151 minutes of football for Juventus last season because of a myriad of injury problems.  manual The 30-year-old even visited Saudi Arabia over the weekend, with sources confirming to 90min that talks were held with PIF over a potential move - though he primarily visited because of external business interests and personal reasons. Pogba, as it stands, would prefer to remain at Juventus to prove himself to manager Massimiliano Allegri - the Italian brought him back to Turin for a second spell and has been loyal to Pogba throughout his career - but the club would not stand in his way if he indicated a desire to leave. 90min understands that a switch to the Saudi Pro League is likely in Pogba's future at some point - PIF view him as the best Muslim player in the world and a cornerstone signing - and that if and when he makes the move, his wages would be on a par with the Â£172m Benzema earns per annum at Al Ittihad. That would make Pogba the highest-paid player in the league once image right and add-ons are factored in, while the club he would join would almost certainly be Al Ittihad - making him a team-mate of Benzema and Kante, who also joined the champions from Chelsea earlier this window."
Donny van de Beek's potential destinations ahead of expected Man Utd exit,"Jul 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/donny-van-de-beek-potential-destinations-man-utd-exit,"The former Ajax star was set to earn a new lease of life at Old Trafford following the arrival of Erik ten Hag, his former boss in Amsterdam, last summer. However, injuries and Bruno Fernandes' significance meant Van de Beek embarked on yet another underwhelming campaign for the Red Devils. The Dutchman was limited to 163 minutes in seven Premier League appearances as Ten Hag struggled to find a role for the astute midfielder. With his career at a crossroads, Van de Beek is expected to leave United this summer with the Red Devils keen to oversee a permanent sale. Here are five feasible options for the midfielder as a whole host of clubs take an interest in acquiring the 26-year-old. Sevilla's 2022/23 season ended with their annual Europa League success and they'll want to carry on that momentum into their 2023/24 domestic campaign.The arrival of Jose Luis Mendilibar as manager sparked a pretty drastic upsurge following the instability facilitated by Jorge Sampaoli.Mendilibar settled upon a 4-2-3-1 following his appointment, with Oliver Torres and Papu Gomez operating as the new manager's magic man between the lines. Van de Beek's best football at Ajax came in a #10 role under Ten Hag and Sevilla could purchase the Dutchman as a potential replacement for 35-year-old Gomez. A return to familiar surroundings may be in store for Van de Beek. The crafty midfielder rose to prominence in the Dutch capital operating as Ten Hag's canny space interpreter who always found himself in the right place at the right time. He played a somewhat unsung role amid Ajax's stellar 2018/19 season with others being thrust into the limelight, but he still earned a big move to United off the back of his Ajax majesty.The 26-year-old has failed to acclimatise to life in the Premier League and will undoubtedly be tempted by his former home this summer. Ajax aren't the exceptional outfit of the Ten Hag era, but Van de Beek will feel at ease at the Johan Cruyff Arena. feed He couldn't, could he?There isn't a fiercer rivalry in Dutch football than De Klassieker contested between the country's two most successful sides: Ajax and Feyenoord. Nevertheless, a whole host of players, including Johan Cruyff and Ronald Koeman, have crossed the divide over the years.Could Van de Beek be next?From a stylistic and tactical perspective, a move to Feyenoord would perhaps make more sense than a return to Ajax this summer. The exit of Orkun Kokcu to Benfica means Arne Slot needs a midfielder of Van de Beek's mould. While his best work has often come in a more advanced role, Slot could perhaps evolve VDB into a tireless double-pivot performer as he did with Kokcu. Nice put together one of the most bizarre squads Europe had to offer last season and that's why they should be considered a serious contender for Van de Beek's signature.The French club's transfer policy of signing Premier League outcasts saw Ross Barkley and Nicolas Pepe join the likes of Dante and Aaron Ramsey in the south of France, although this bunch were outshone by the club's impressive youth cohort.There appear to be superior stylistic fits for VDB this summer, but Nice must be considered as a legitimate option. A move may depend on Khephren Thuram's future. Crystal Palace are one of three Premier League clubs keen on signing Van de Beek this summer and certainly a much better fit than either Wolves or Nottingham Forest.Pragmatist Julen Lopetegui hasn't exactly been an appreciator of Van de Beek profiles in the past, while Forest are well-stocked in terms of creative midfielders.Palace, though, could be a fun environment for VDB in the Premier League. Roy Hodgson helped restore the good vibes at Selhurst Park by given his forward-thinking players plenty of freedom. Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze shone down the stretch as a result and Van de Beek would surely benefit from such relaxed but smart coaching."
Chelsea hold talks with Montpellier over exciting young French striker,"Jul 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-talks-montpellier-young-french-striker,"Wahi enjoyed a breakout season in Ligue 1 last year, racking up 19 goals - good enough for seventh in the division's scoring charts - while also chipping in with a further six assists. That form has, unsurprisingly, caught the eyes of a number of teams across Europe and 90min understands representatives of Chelsea's BlueCo ownership group have spoken to Montpellier over a potential deal for Wahi. At this point, it is unclear whether Wahi is seen as a target for Chelsea or the newest club in the BlueCo family, fellow Ligue 1 side Strasbourg, who have just appointed Patrick Vieira as their new manager. Vieira is understood to have been involved in conversations about Wahi since joining. In England, Wahi has also been tracked by Bournemouth, Crystal Palace and Wolves, while Lazio and Union Berlin are known admirers in mainland Europe. feed However, it is Eintracht Frankfurt who are seen as the biggest competitors for Wahi's signature, with the Bundesliga side seeing him as a potential replacement for Randal Kolo Muani if the in-demand forward moves elsewhere. A source close to Wahi has confirmed to 90min that the striker is intrigued by the idea of moving to Frankfurt, where fellow Frenchman Kolo Muani exploded into a â¬100m target for a handful of European giants. Over the weekend, Montpellier president Laurent Nicollin confessed to Midi Libre that 'a German and an English club' are battling for Wahi's signature, ultimately declining to reveal their identities. Chelsea have already bolstered their forward line with the signings of Christopher Nkunku and Nicolas Jackson but are understood to remain in the market for another striker. An enquiry has been made over Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic, in which Romelu Lukaku's name was mentioned, but Chelsea continue to evaluate all their options."
Five strikers Real Madrid could sign instead of Kylian Mbappe,"Jul 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/five-strikers-real-madrid-sign-instead-kylian-mbappe,"The Frenchman's antics this summer have seemingly disillusioned the club where he boasts supreme power, and a move to the Spanish capital is more than a feasible possibility after years of missed opportunities on Real's behalf. However, there are no guarantees that such a mammoth and complex deal will go through heading into 2023/24.  With Karim Benzema venturing off to the emerging Saudi frontier, Real's striker situation is currently a precarious one. They won't be heading into the new season with Joselu leading the line, that's for sure, and Endrick, the Brazilian sensation who'll arrive next summer, is surely too young to be considered Benzema's successor right away.  There's a period of transition up top Real must mitigate, and they're hoping to acquire Mbappe as their next Galactico. However, there are other options for Los Blancos should Mbappe remain in Paris.  Here a five alternatives to Mbappe for the Spanish giants to consider. Fresh off his Capocannoniere crowning season with Napoli, Osimhen has attracted interest from several members of Europe's elite and is considered one of the most valuable forwards on the planet. As a result, Aurelio De Laurentiis will not let his Nigerian hitman depart lightly this summer and the president's stubbornness will likely deter potential suitors. As special as Osimhen is, clubs are unlikely to come close to Napoli's reported asking price of Â£150m.  The Italian club's depth up top could facilitate a sale late in the summer, but it's hard to envisage Real spending that sort of cash for a player not called Kylian.  The 24-year-old would thrive under the bright Bernabeu lights, but a considerable compromise will have to be reached over a fee if Real were to step up their interest. Another name doing the rounds in transfer rumour mills this summer, Kolo Muani has had Manchester United and Bayern Munich on his tail. The French international is expected to leave Eintracht Frankfurt after their disappointing 2022/23 season, but the two aforementioned clubs have moved on to different targets. United are pushing for Atalanta's Rasmus Hojlund, while Bayern are hopeful of prising Harry Kane away from Tottenham. Good luck with that, guys.  Nevertheless, Kolo Muani remains on the market and he could be a wise alternative to Mbappe. He's a flexible frontman who loves to drift out to the channels and battle defenders one-on-one. The young forward may not be an out-and-out number nine, but neither is Mbappe. Alongside Rodrygo and Vinicius Jr, the trio could combine to create an interchangeable machine up top with speed to burn in behind defences. Despite another productive season with Inter, Lautaro hasn't been such a prominent name in the market this summer. The World Cup winner is among the hottest and coldest strikers. He's so hard to defend against when he's on, but his off days are so woeful that many clubs will undoubtedly be deterred.  Consistency has been an issue for Lautaro throughout his senior career, but the striker's maturation has seen him evolve into a regular producer in front of goal. He scored 20+ Serie A goals for the second season running in 2022/23 and played a leading role as the Nerazzurri lifted two domestic trophies before reaching the Champions League final. The Lautaro of three years ago may not have been able to cope with the pressure of leading Real's line, but the new and improved iteration certainly is.  A left-field choice, but Real may have to think outside of the box if they're to find a desirable Mbappe alternative this summer. Success for Alvarez at Manchester City seemed inevitable after the Citizens snapped the River Plate hotshot up for peanuts and he joined the club ahead of the 2022/23 season. Despite playing second fiddle to Erling Haaland, Alvarez scored 17 times in all competitions and played a starring role in Argentina's ascent to World Cup glory. Alvarez has already drawn comparisons to Sergio Aguero, but some might argue the young Argentine has more strings to his bow. While an excellent finisher, Alvarez has the makings of an elite multi-faceted #9 in the mould of Kane.  City will surely demand a monster fee, but it's worth Real testing the waters. There are several avenues Los Blancos could go this summer if they miss out on Mbappe again.  They could go for a stop-gap to oversee the period of transition before the Frenchman's inevitable arrival in 2024 as well as Endrick's, a seasoned star who'll ensure Real are competitive in 2023/24 and beyond, or they could continue their new policy of breeding exciting young talent and back them to shine right away.  Two of our suggested five fall into the second category, while the other three fall into the third, including our fifth alternative: Jonathan David.  The 23-year-old has enjoyed three stellar seasons with Lille and he just enjoyed the most productive campaign of his career to date, scoring 24 goals in 37 Ligue 1 appearances. David has caught the eye of plenty amid his rise in France, and Juventus are said to be in the race for him this summer. His profile is comparable to a couple of the options already mentioned, and if Real aren't too keen on splashing out a massive fee, David could prove to be an astute alternative. manual"
Levi Colwill reveals non-negotiable stance amid Liverpool transfer links,"Jul 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/levi-colwill-non-negotiable-stance-liverpool-transfer,"Colwill was a key member of England's U21's side that beat Spain in the UEFA U21 European Championship final on Sunday, playing the full 90 minutes as Lee Carsley's side edged over the line thanks to goalkeeper James Trafford's sensational penalty save in stoppage-time. The 20-year-old was also one of the breakout stars of the 2022/23 Premier League season, becoming a regular under Roberto De Zerbi during a successful loan spell at Brighton and Hove Albion.  90min recently revealed that despite Brighton's willingness to spend a club record Â£40m to sign Colwill on a permanent deal, Chelsea are unwilling to sanction a move and want to see how he performs under Mauricio Pochettino in pre-season before making a final decision. Liverpool have also been linked to Colwill, amid uncertainty around Joel Matip's long-term future at Anfield, but sources have confirmed to 90min that the Reds are acutely aware that a transfer is almost certainly off the table. feed With Colwill's stock high, there have been suggestions that Gareth Southgate will look to make him a regular fixture in England's senior squad this season. And that's something the defender has admitted is a target of his, though he was quick to conclude that he must be playing regular games in order to make it happen. ""Weâre all pushing and knocking on the door,â Colwill said, in quoted relayed by the Mail. ""Everyone has to pay attention to every player here. I feel like this team we had was more than just individuals. In the past England might have lacked with that. Weâve always had great players but I think this team is so much different. I love this team. ""Iâll speak to my family, speak to everyone I need to and make a decision. Iâve got to play at the end of the day, to hopefully get there and go to the next [senior] camp. ""But if Iâm here, Iâll still be happy. Youâve always got to be happy when youâre picked for any England age group. Itâs an honour."" Colwill recently received his first England senior call-up ahead of the Euro 2024 qualifiers against Malta and North Macedonia, but failed to make an appearance in either game."
Chelsea hold firm on Romelu Lukaku valuation after rejecting Inter bid,"Jul 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-hold-firm-on-romelu-lukaku-valuation-inter-bid,"The two clubs have been locked in negotiations over Lukaku for months, with Chelsea knocking back a handful of offers from Inter as they seek to recover as much money as possible from their initial Â£97.5m investment. Inter's attempts to re-sign Lukaku on loan were quickly blocked by Chelsea, who are only entertaining a permanent departure for the wantaway Belgian. An offer of around Â£30m has recently been rejected by Chelsea, with sources confirming to 90min that the Blues are pushing Inter to raise their bid by another Â£10m. Inter are not blessed with a huge transfer budget and are therefore keen to avoid spending big on Lukaku, although the sale of goalkeeper Andre Onana to Manchester United could offer the Nerazzurri added flexibility in negotiations if it goes through as expected. feed Talks between the two clubs are ongoing and are complicated by the fact that Chelsea still owe money to Inter for their initial purchase of Lukaku in the summer of 2021. While that is not expected to get in the way of an agreement, it does add another layer in discussions. To try and aid the move, Lukaku is prepared to take a significant pay cut. He is focused solely on returning to Inter this summer despite attracting interest from elsewhere. Juventus have enquired about Lukaku after Chelsea voiced an interest in Bianconeri striker Dusan Vlahovic - one of many names on a shortlist of potential Blues targets - but Lukaku is not interested in joining another Serie A side. Lukaku has also snubbed the chance to move to Saudi Arabia, who made a renewed effort to convince the striker to head to the Middle East after initially reaching out earlier this summer. Their offer remains on the table but, as it stands, Lukaku does not want to accept as he waits for Inter to reach an agreement."
Clubs alerted to Daichi Kamada availability as AC Milan stop free transfer,"Jul 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/clubs-alerted-to-daichi-kamada-availability-transfer,"Japan international Kamada has been a free agent since the end of June when his contract with Eintracht Frankfurt expired. The 26-year-old had made a name for himself with the German club since 2017, winning the Europa League in 2021/22 and then reaching the knockout rounds of the Champions League in 2022/23. As a goalscoring midfielder, he found the net 16 times in all competitions last season. Seeking a new challenge, an agreement to join Milan was reached in early June. However, just a few days later the club sacked technical director Paolo Maldini, while Frederic Massara also left his role as sporting director. Chief executive Giorgio Furlani and chief scout Geoffrey Moncada have been overseeing transfers since, with Antonio DâOttavio, former head of youth scouting, said to also be internally promoted to fill the sporting director vacancy. feed That has changed the situation regarding Kamada and the new hierarchy have different ideas. 90min understands the deal was agreed and signed from the playerâs side of things, with Milan pulling out. As a free agent without a club, he now has to look elsewhere. Inter and Napoli, both of whom finished higher than Milan in the final Serie A table last season, have been offered Kamada. Borussia Dortmund, who had shown an interest in the player before, have also been informed of the situation. It is a similar story for Tottenham and Newcastle, each holding an interest previously."
Donny van de Beek exploring options to leave Manchester United,"Jul 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/donny-van-de-beek-exploring-options-manchester-united,"Van de Beek joined United in September 2020 from Ajax, but has never been able to establish a foothold in the club's first team under a number of managers. Van de Beek has been behind Bruno Fernandes in the midfield pecking order and has struggled with a number of debilitating injuries during his spell in England. Under Erik ten Hag, current United manager and Van de Beek's former manager at Ajax, the player's fortunes haven't changed. Van de Beek sustained an injury in January which kept him out for the second half of last season and while he has joined pre-season training in recent days, United have also signed Mason Mount from Chelsea - further reducing Van de Beek's chances of playing time in the new campaign. While Ten Hag has a good relationship with the player, it's understood by 90min that he and the decision-makers at United have green-lit Van de Beek's departure from the club, and the player's camp are exploring a new challenge. feed Van de Beek has a number of clubs in Serie A interested in his services, with Inter, Roma and Milan all making their own enquiries, though it's understood he is not a first choice target for any of the three. In the Premier League, Wolves, Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace are all monitoring the 26-year-old's situation. Europa League holders Sevilla and Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Nice hold interest, as does Brendan Rodgers' Celtic. A return to Ajax has not been ruled out either and Dutch champions Feyenoord would also be open to accomodating the player on the right terms. United would prefer a sale as they try to clear their squad of players who aren't in the long-term plans for the first team, though a loan looks more likely as it stands. Anthony Martial, club captain Harry Maguire, Fred, Dean Henderson, Eric Bailly and Alex Telles are all among a host of players United would like to part ways with before the new season starts; to clear their wage bill and raise funds to reinvest into the first team. United are trying to secure up to two new forwards and another midfielder, while right back and centre back are on the agenda to strengthen. United are likely to follow up the signing of Mount this week with a deal worth over â¬50m expected to be confirmed for Inter's Andre Onana, following David de Gea's departure on a free transfer over the weekend."

Youngster reacts to 'shock' Chelsea transfer,"Jul 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/youngster-reacts-to-shock-chelsea-transfer,"90min reported last week that the Blues had fended off competition from Manchester City, Newcastle United and Tottenham to secure the services of the defender who'd been a regular for Everton's Under-21 side last season.

Bayern Munich submit second Harry Kane bid,"Jul 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-submit-second-harry-kane-bid,"The England captain has only one year remaining on his current deal. Spurs have been confident of keeping Kane for the long-term future and have already rejected interest worth â¬70m from German champions Bayern earlier this summer. Tottenham do not plan to sell their talisman during the window. 90min understands no potential price tag has been decided by the club hierarchy while Bayern and manager Thomas Tuchel push for a deal. Former Chelsea boss Tuchel wants Kane to lead the line and is hopeful of securing a deal over the coming months. However, Spurs remain bullish and are not interested in letting the second top scorer in Premier League history leave. feed The 29-year-old was in brilliant form again in 2022/23, scoring 30 goals as his side finished a lowly eighth. Despite Kane's trophy draught extending by another season, major clubs around Europe expected him to remain at Spurs at the beginning of the summer. Manchester United, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid are all known admirers but fears over an extortionate price tag have stopped most continental giants from making a move. New manager Ange Postecoglou will hope Kane is still at the club when the 2023/24 season kicks off. Spurs have added Dejan Kulusevki to their ranks permanently during the window so far while Guglielmo Vicario and James Maddison have also been brought in."
Fabinho reacts to Liverpool signing Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai,"Jul 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/fabinho-reacts-liverpool-signing-alexis-mac-allister-dominik-szoboszlai,"The Reds' midfield was picked apart at points in the 2022/23 season as Jurgen Klopp's side missed out on Champions League qualification. However, they have moved quickly to sign their top transfer targets early in the window. Mac Allister and Szoboszlai both boast considerable goal threat which few Liverpool midfielders could match last season and Fabinho says the quality of depth will help his side regain their former level. ""We lost, I think, three midfield players that were really important for us in the last maybe five, six years. It's good to bring some good players in that position because we will need [them]. ""In the way we play, the intensity we play, we always need not just three or four but maybe six players in this position [in the squad]. feed ""So yes, it's good to have these two players with us now. We played against them already, so we know how good they are. It's good to have them in the team. ""Sometimes we will lose some very good friends. That's the case with Bobby [Firmino]; he's gone, so I wish him and his family all the best. âWe have to focus on the players that we have now. At the moment, Mac Allister and Szoboszlai have arrived. I didn't see them yet, they have a couple more days of holidays. ""We just hope that they will be ready to be with us. We will help them in the adaptation and hope they will be ready and get the ideas of the team as quick as possible."" World Cup winner Mac Allister has plenty of Premier League experience after breaking into the Seagulls side under Graham Potter, while Szoboszlai faced Liverpool twice in the 2019/20 Champions League group stages."

Endrick reveals Vinicius Junior's influence on Real Madrid transfer decision,"Jul 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/endrick-vinicius-junior-influence-real-madrid-transfer-decision,"The 16-year-old's big money move to Los Blancos was announced in December 2022 but he cannot play for his new club until 2024 due to FIFA regulations. As such, Endrick is currently plying his trade at Brazilian club Palmeiras, where he has scored seven goals so far this season. Speaking about his decision to join Real Madrid over the likes of Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona, the youngster revealed the huge role current Blancos superstar Vinicius played in his decision. He told Marca: ""Vinicius is a friend of mine. I was able to spend the holidays with him, I was able to see him and talk to him. feed ""He told me a lot of things about Real Madrid. He told me I'm going to be fine. It is a very good message knowing that it is the word of a player who is there and also Brazilian. By playing there he becomes an idol for me. ""It can become a mirror for many people. His word gave me even more strength to close it with Real Madrid. Before I went on vacation with him I had already closed it. So I arrived calmer. I talked to him, to the people there and I thank God for that."" While Endrick needed Vinicius to help him choose Real Madrid, he was also keen to insist Los Blancos were always his first choice thanks in large part to the Brazilian legends who have played for the club. ""My name wasn't going to be Endrick, it was going to be Di Stefano, who was a Real Madrid player. So I went to look into it. I also looked at the Brazilians who have played like Ronaldo, Vinicius now, Rodrigo, Eder [Militao]...so as I saw my idols play there, as I saw the history of Real Madrid, I became even more interested. I became interested in the biggest club in Europe. ""Then I saw it as a challenge for me to try to play for Madrid, which was the team I always wanted. Play for Real Madrid. That's why I chose Real Madrid. I always wanted to go there."""

The 10 most expensive Brazil players of all time,"Jul 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/10-most-expensive-brazil-players-all-time,"There is occasionally a premium price to pay for good Brazilian players, though every great team should have at least one Selecao player as they remind us all of why we love football. Some massive transfer fees have been paid for Brazilian players over the years, more commonly when they move from their first European club to an even bigger one, having originally moved from Brazil for a smaller fee. Here are the ten most expensive Brazilian footballers of all time. Richarlison enjoyed the drama that Everton provided year on year but left in 2022 when Tottenham came calling with a Â£60m offer.Spurs ended the Brazilian's debut season in north London in catastrophic fashion with Richarlison's contribution minimal. This was a move viewed by many as somewhat disappointing. Oscar was an impressive and important player for Chelsea and the national team but opted for the riches that Chinese clubs could offer.He moved to Shanghai Port, known as Shanghai SIPG at the time in 2017, for a massive fee. He remains in China, suggesting he must have settled very well. A recent entrant here, Manchester United's deal for Casemiro in 2022 saw him leave Real Madrid after nine frighteningly successful years.He was an immediate hit in the Premier League as he showed why he is one of the best midfielders in the world, although suspensions were an issue later in the season. It was a big fee for a player who was 30 at the time, but he seems to still be at the peak of his powers. Before Sandro Tonali had his move to Newcastle confirmed, this was the biggest fee ever paid for an AC Milan player. Kaka was a star in Serie A but the time came for him to try an even bigger challenge in 2009.He spent four years in Spain before he going back to Milan for a year until he left again in 2014. Certainly the highest player on this list to make minimal impact anywhere since the move, Arthur Melo was involved in an odd transfer to Juventus in 2020. Juventus paid â¬72m for him but the deal was also part of a coordinated swap that saw Miralem Pjanic go the other way. Arthur was not useless at Juventus, but his impact was not what they had hoped it would be. Most recently he was on loan at Liverpool where he made one appearance all season, with injuries beginning to mark his career. An incredibly expensive deal for a goalkeeper which has gone on to look like value for money. Alisson Becker was a superb goalkeeper for AS Roma in Serie A and then he got the move he deserved.It is not easy to turn up at a club like Liverpool as a goalkeeper with that kind of fee on your head, but he has cemented himself as one of, if not the best goalkeeper in the world. Neymar has been the subject of two huge transfer fees and appears twice in the top ten. The first was the massive â¬86m move from Santos to Barcelona in 2014.The eccentric attacker was part of a treble-winning side and formed a deadly partnership with Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi before he made a dramatic exit from Camp Nou. The most recent huge fee to be paid for a Brazilian, Antony joined Manchester United in 2022 like Casemiro but much later in the summer. The â¬100m fee meant there was immense pressure on the new arrival from Ajax.While ridiculed by many, the development of Antony's game through the 2022/23 season was clear and he ended the season with eight goals and three assists. This is a move that did not work out but Philippe Coutinho will still be able to take immense pride in his career regardless. The move from Liverpool to Barcelona in 2018 was a monster and the pressure appeared too much.He did not fit in the system at Barcelona and could not show his best form. He had a loan at Bayern Munich before another at Aston Villa, which has become his new home. Neymar's spell at Barcelona was a success and led to PSG putting a frankly silly â¬222m on the table for his services in 2017. It remains the most expensive transfer ever.He has scored plenty of goals for PSG, but they have not won the Champions League and now his relationship with the fans seems at a point of no return. feed"
PSG confirm signing of Lucas Hernandez from Bayern Munich,"Jul 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-confirm-signing-lucas-hernandez-bayern-munich,"Personal terms were agreed with Lucas back in May around the same time as an agreement was struck to bring Manuel Ugarte to the French capital, but agreeing a deal with Bayern proved slightly more complicated. A fee of around â¬50m was eventually hammered out between the two clubs and Lucas has now sealed his move to PSG, signing a five-year contract until 2028. feed Born in Marseille, Lucas has never played club football in France. He moved to Spain aged four and, after coming through the Atletico Madrid academy, joined Bayern for a fee of â¬80m in 2019. Injuries would prove to be a problem for Lucas in Germany, however. He managed just 107 appearances for the club across his four seasons with Bayern and only played 11 games last year as a result of a various serious fitness issues. Lucas will now have the chance to rebuild his fitness in Paris, while Bayern are set to replace the France international with Kim Min-jae of Napoli. The South Korean's release clause has been triggered and paid, with completion of the â¬50m deal expected imminently."
Rio Ferdinand gives verdict on Man Utd goalkeeper target Andre Onana,"Jul 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/rio-ferdinand-gives-verdict-man-utd-goalkeeper-target-andre-onana,"David de Gea's departure after 12 years was confirmed on Saturday after the Spaniard's contract had expired at the end of last month and no new one was fully signed. The terms on a Â£200,000 per week deal had been agreed and signed on the playerâs side, only for the club to later withdraw it. Although arguably the best goalkeeper in the world between 2014 and 2017, De Gea had become increasingly error prone. There were also concerns about the 32-year-oldâs distribution and his unease in an increasingly modern and progressive playing style under Erik ten Hag. United are on course to make Ten Hag's former Ajax stopper Andre Onana their new number one. Two bids, the latter reaching â¬50m (Â£43m), have been turned down by Inter but there is expected to be a compromise below Interâs â¬60m (Â£51m) demands and 90min understands United are hoping to have a deal finalised in time for Onana to travel to Norway with the squad for the opening game of pre-season against Leeds on 12 July. The next friendly is in Edinburgh a week later. feed Ferdinand, who spent 12 years with United and won six Premier League titles, is supportive of the push for Onana and the skillset the Cameroonian will bring. ""He'll give United more confidence and more ability to play out from the back and I think he suits an Erik ten Hag team,"" the retired defender said on his FIVE YouTube channel. ""He's a real modern-day goalkeeper. You see teams pressing him and he doesn't even panic. He gets the ball in, brings on the press, says 'come on, come to me' and when that player comes to him, he knows there's a [teammate] free somewhere else and he normally finds them. ""I think there will be mistakes and playing that risky way you do have mistakes...that happens, but it's about staying true to your beliefs, finding the right balance and remaining calm throughout those periods."""
Bayern Munich pay full Kim Min-jae release clause to beat Man Utd to transfer,"Jul 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-pay-full-kim-min-jae-release-clause-man-utd-transfer,"Manchester United held talks with Kim over a possible transfer last month, but Bayern have beaten them to the highly-rated South Korea international. Kim quickly emerged as one of Europeâs best central defenders during his sole season with Napoli following an â¬18m transfer from Fenerbahce last summer. Having joined the Turkish giants from Beijing Guoan in China for just â¬3m in 2021, his rise to prominence has been rapid. feed A â¬50m release clause in Kimâs Napoli contract active from 1 July has been much talked about. Having been unsuccessful in offering the 26-year-old a fresh deal that would have meant a substantial pay rise while removing the clause, 90min understands the reigning Serie A champions were then never willing to negotiate a transfer fee with potential suitors and that paying the full amount specified in the contract was the only way to sign him. At one stage it is believed the preference of the playerâs camp was to join United, who are looking to move on Harry Maguire. Newcastle and Paris Saint-Germain were also in touch. But Bayern surged ahead and sources close to Napoli have now confirmed the full release clause has been received. Kim is set to complete the final part of his medical with the German giants and will become the latest Korean to join Bayern after Jeong Woo-yeong and Lee Hyun-ju in recent years."
Granit Xhaka reveals reason for Arsenal exit,"Jul 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/granit-xhaka-reveals-reason-arsenal-exit,"Xhaka agreed a â¬25m move to North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany after a brilliant campaign for the Gunners, helping them to second and qualification for the Champions League. His exit comes with Arsenal close to bringing in Declan Rice for a British record transfer fee as Mikel Arteta reshapes his midfield ahead of the 2023/24 season. There had been claims Xhaka's wife's unhappiness in England played a part in the 30-year-old leaving, but he has rejected that idea. Xhaka told Keystone-SDA: ""There was speculation everywhere that my wife was no longer happy in England. That is not at all true. feed ""The fact is that as a person I am always interested in new challenges. After seven years, the time has come for something completely new.  ""The league is not new, but the club is. During the talks with Simon Rolfes [sporting director] and Xabi Alonso, I felt that the long-term project at Leverkusen was worthwhile and that it was 100% in line with me."" The Switzerland international brought a fluctuating stint with the Gunners that lasted seven years to an end by returning to the Bundesliga with Xabi Alonso's Leverkusen. He won the FA Cup twice and scored 23 goals in 297 appearances for the north London side. Xhaka won over Arsenal fans by becoming an important cog under Mikel Arteta, having previously been an outcast under Unai Emery after storming off the pitch and losing the club captaincy in 2019."

PSG confirm signing of Lee Kang-in from Mallorca,"Jul 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-confirm-signing-lee-kang-in-mallorca,"PSG have been incredibly active this summer and have already announced the arrivals of Milan Skriniar, Marco Asensio and Manuel Ugarte, while Luis Enrique has replaced Christophe Galtier in the dugout. The next new face in Paris is Lee, who has inked a five-year contract in the French capital. ""It's a pleasure to be able to join Paris Saint-Germain, it's one of the biggest clubs in the world, with some of the greatest players in the world,"" said Lee, who will wear the number 19. ""I can't wait to start this new adventure."" PSG are understood to have parted with a fee of â¬22m to get this deal over the line. feed The French giants are not yet finished this summer and are expected to announce the arrival of defender Lucas Hernandez from Bayern Munich in the coming days.  After Lucas' arrival is confirmed, PSG's focus may well turn to departures and there is no issue more pressing than the future of Kylian Mbappe, who could be sold this summer after admitting he does not plan to extend his contract beyond next summer. Mbappe has publicly vowed to remain with PSG next season but club officials have made it clear that he will not be permitted to leave on a free transfer, leaving him two options - a contract extension or a sale. Long-time suitors Real Madrid are waiting for clarity on Mbappe's stance, safe in the knowledge they could sign him for free in 2024."
David de Gea's potential destinations after Man Utd exit,"Jul 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/david-de-gea-potential-destinations-after-man-utd-exit,"The pair were at Atletico Madrid together in the distant days of 2011. However, unlike his former colleague - who was forced into premature retirement due to a heart condition - De Gea is set to carry on playing after announcing his departure from Manchester United at the start of July. ""Now, itâs the right time to undertake a new challenge,"" De Gea wrote in his farewell message, ""to push myself again in new surroundings."" Here's a look at where the hunt for new challenges and surroundings may take De Gea. Andre Onana has been United's chief target as De Gea's replacement throughout the summer. In the wake of the Spaniard's announcement, United are expected to lodge a third bid which comes closer to Inter's Â£51m valuation of Onana.Last season's defeated Champions League finalists could snag Onana's replacement as part of the negotiations. If Inter are willing to consider former Tottenham captain Hugo Lloris, why not take a look at De Gea? After finally ridding themselves of one ageing and increasingly erratic shot-stopper, Tottenham have been linked with signing another.De Gea is four years younger than Lloris and not quite as flawed but would still serve as an experienced option for the incoming Guglielmo Vicario to bounce off. Had it not been for football's unfathomable reliance upon the fax machine, De Gea could have been a Real Madrid player in 2015. The move never materialised but the Madrid-born keeper could return to his roots on a free transfer this summer.It's highly unlikely that Thibaut Courtois would entertain any competition for his berth as the club's undisputed number one, but De Gea would offer more solidity than the current backup option Andriy Lunin. The Italian icon Gianni Rivera once disparagingly referred to the American top flight as ""an elephant graveyard"". The division has done its best to rebrand itself as a hotbed of young talent but this summer has seen another influx of ageing stars flood the league.Inter Miami, with the headline-grabbing acquisitions of Lionel Messi and friends, are the chief culprits and may not have room for De Gea on their roster. However, MLS rivals Atlanta United may be tempted to procure the services of a Premier League champion without having to pay a transfer fee.Brad Guzan spent six years in England's top flight but has begun to show the effects of dulled reflexes of a shot-stopper that turns 39 in September. Guzan's backup Quentin Westberg is 37 himself, perhaps offering De Gea an avenue into MLS. Chelsea have been burned in the recent past after acquiring a Spanish goalkeeper. However, while Kepa Arrizabalaga commanded a world-record fee, De Gea would be available for free.At 32, De Gea should theoretically be at his peak as a goalkeeper. Chelsea were able to cajole a fee of Â£17m from Al Ahli for Edouard Mendy (who is 31) in June, opening up a slot in their goalkeeping reserves which De Gea has been linked with filling. When De Gea lined up against Newcastle at Wembley in February, not only did he steer the Red Devils to victory in the League Cup final but he kept a record-breaking 180th clean sheet in the process - no other player has ever racked up more in United's long history.Newcastle had to draft in the former Liverpool keeper Lorius Karius for the showpiece as injury and suspension conspired against the Magpies, hinting at a lack of depth behind the number one, Nick Pope.If De Gea did move to Tyneside - as is rumoured - his shaky distribution would not be a deal-breaker given the style of play Eddie Howe is fostering. David De Gea is LEAVING Manchester United after 12 years at the club! ð³ð§¤ pic.twitter.com/wFxV0x03ta For any player in search of a pay packet that European clubs are unwilling to cough up, the Saudi Pro League has emerged as an accommodating alternative.Al Hilal used four different goalkeepers last season, with 36-year-old Abdullah Al-Mayouf the most regular custodian. Ruben Neves and Kalidou Koulibaly have already joined the Saudi giants and De Gea could be next.De Gea has even been linked with a reunion with Cristiano Ronaldo at Al Nassr, who could step up their pursuit of the stopper now he is on the hunt for work."
When Man Utd hope to announce Andre Onana deal,"Jul 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/when-man-utd-hope-announce-andre-onana-deal,"United have seen a second bid, worth â¬50m, knocked back for Onana but are confident of reaching a full agreement in the near future. Inter had demanded â¬60m but the two sides are expected to meet in the middle somewhere. Talks between the two clubs have continued and progressed to a point that United are beginning to plan for Onana's imminent arrival. United are understood to be hopeful of reaching a full agreement to sign Onana over the weekend and sources have confirmed to 90min that the plan is to take the 27-year-old to Oslo when their pre-season tour begins on July 12. A friendly against Leeds United is on the cards, seven days before a meeting with Lyon in Edinburgh, Scotland. feed United are in need of a new starting goalkeeper this summer after David de Gea confirmed his departure from the club on Saturday. De Gea had been offered the chance to stay at United with a drastic reduction to his previous Â£375,000-a-week wages but the 32-year-old will now take his talents elsewhere, leaving United needing a new starter for the first time in 12 years. On the books currently are returning loanee Dean Henderson, who is of serious interest to Nottingham Forest, and 37-year-old Tom Heaton. Inter could look to reinvest any money earned from Onana's departure in Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku. The Blues will only listen to permanent offers for the Belgian and talks are ongoing between the two sides."
Manchester City offer Kyle Walker new contract to fend off Bayern Munich interest,"Jul 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/manchester-city-offer-kyle-walker-new-contract-bayern-munich,"Walker has entered the final 12 months of his current deal and has been targeted by Bayern Munich, who are set for a change at right-back as Benjamin Pavard is keen to leave the Allianz Arena. The 33-year-old is yet to make a decision on his future. Being left out of the starting lineup for the Champions League final is understood to have hurt Walker and sparked questions over his continuation in Manchester. City are keen to see Walker make a decision soon and hope that the veteran defender chooses to stay. Sources have told 90min that the treble winners have extended an offer of a new contract to Walker to try and reaffirm their commitment to him. However, if Walker opts to pursue an exit instead, City will not stand in his way and will listen to offers. feed Walker is Bayern's top priority for their right-back spot although the Bundesliga giants have not yet ruled out a renewed offer for fellow City man Joao Cancelo, who spent the last six months on loan in Bavaria. There is also interest in Walker from Saudi Arabia but the former Tottenham man believes a move to the Middle East could harm his chances of starting for England at Euro 2024. Elsewhere, City have agreed terms with Southampton over the sale of 19-year-old midfielder Shea Charles, who is expected to move to St Mary's for around Â£10m. The Northern Ireland international made his senior debut off the bench in City's final Premier League game of the season against Brentford. Southampton have also expressed an interest in signing Premier League 2 player of the year Carlos Borges on loan and City are open to a temporary move for the 19-year-old winger, who also has interest from France, Germany and Portugal."
David de Gea confirms Manchester United exit,"Jul 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/david-de-gea-confirms-manchester-united-exit,"The goalkeeper's previous deal expired this summer and he was offered the chance to re-sign on significantly reduced terms, but De Gea has now confirmed that he will instead walk away from Old Trafford. ""I just wanted to send this farewell message to all Manchester United supporters,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""I would like to express my unwavering gratitude and appreciation for the love from the last 12 years. Weâve achieved a lot since my dear Sir Alex Ferguson brought me to this club. I took incredible pride every time I pulled on this shirt, to lead the team, to represent this institution, the biggest club in the world was an honour only bestowed upon a few lucky footballers. feed ""Itâs been an unforgettable and successful period since I came here. I didnât think from leaving Madrid as a young boy we would achieve what we did together. ""Now, itâs the right time to undertake a new challenge, to push myself again in new surroundings. ""Manchester will always be in my heart, Manchester has shaped me and will never leave me."" De Gea leaves United after 12 years at Old Trafford which yielded 545 appearances in all competitions and eight trophies, including the 2012/13 Premier League title. While United were hopeful of keeping De Gea, club officials have long been searching for a new high-level goalkeeper and are close to striking an agreement for Inter's Andre Onana. "
Why do top clubs want to sign Romeo Lavia?,"Jul 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/why-do-top-clubs-want-to-sign-romeo-lavia,"Southampton's dismal performances resulted in a deserved relegation from the Premier League and they now face the unenviable challenge of navigating the ruthless Championship in an attempt to return to the top tier.  The Saints will likely have a big budget to work with next campaign though, especially when the bidding war for young Lavia commences. The Belgian is wanted by Arsenal and Liverpool chiefly, but is also admired by a host of the world's biggest clubs. Southampton have no chance of holding onto their defensive-midfielder, nor will they particularly want to knowing the size of the transfer fee they can expect for him. An auction for Lavia appears increasingly imminent. But why is Lavia in such high-demand? Let's have a look at his strengths... A traditional number six, Lavia is not one for finding himself too far up the pitch. His greatest attributes are his defensive qualities, snapping into tackles and using his physicality to regain possession.  He averages 2.43 tackles per 90, as well as 1.34 interceptions and 1.9 blocks, highlighting his ability to screen a defence and stop danger at source. Lavia reads the game incredibly well for someone of such a tender age and stood out as Southampton's key performer alongside James Ward-Prowse last season. Having previously spoken of his idolisation of Fernandinho and the honour of getting to work with him, albeit briefly, you can see parallels between the pair.  Lavia also boasts a good passing range if not spectacularly efficient with an 86.2% accuracy in the Premier League last season. He was particularly adept at picking out medium and long passes when compared to his midfield peers.  Club Appearances Pass accuracy Tackles and interceptions Goals and assists Southampton 34 86.2% 93 2 The real question is who wouldn't want to sign Lavia? The answer: nobody.  However, it appears the Premier League's big dogs are the ones battling it out for his signature, with two clubs seemingly at the front of the queue.  feed Given City's buy-back clause, it is unlikely that Southampton would accept Â£40m or less for Lavia this summer. The Saints apparently want in excess of Â£50m for the midfielder and will be eager for as many clubs to show interest as possible to encourage a bidding war. Considering the south coast side only paid a maximum of Â£14m for Lavia, they will make a tidy profit on a player just a year after capturing his signature. For whoever comes in for the Saints' number 45, it will prove a worthwhile signing. "
Why would Man Utd want Andre Onana?,"Jul 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/why-would-man-utd-want-andre-onana,"With David de Gea now technically a free agent and a series of cryptic tweets from the Spaniard suggesting that contract negotiations over a new deal are not progressing, it looks more likely than ever that his 12-year Old Trafford career is coming to an end. Andre Onana is the man the Red Devils have turned to in order to fill De Gea's gloves, with the Inter goalkeeper having enjoyed a stellar season in Serie A and Europe. Despite having only been at San Siro since last summer, the Cameroonian is set to be on the move already. Manchester United have submitted a second bid for Onana, having seen the first one rebuffed, but still remain a distance from Inter's valuation. While there is optimism over the completion of a deal, there is still some way to go before Onana arrives in Manchester. But why are United so desperate to sign the 27-year-old? One of the key reasons why Erik ten Hag is keen to add Onana to his squad is due to the goalkeeper's technical prowess. The stopper is very comfortable with the ball at his feet and is a great distributor - exactly what Ten Hag demands of his man between the sticks. He attempted just over 36 passes per 90 minutes in Serie A last season, while Dea Gea averaged just over 27 in the Premier League, with Onana also boasting a 10.2% better pass accuracy than his Spanish counterpart.  Onana can more efficiently implement Ten Hag's passing philosophy at Old Trafford and would make United more press-resistant due to his ability to bypass the first wave of pressure with a long pass into midfield or the forward line. Last season's Champions League final perfectly exemplified the goalkeeper's technical talents.  First and foremost, however, Onana is there to keep the ball out of the net, something he does very well indeed. He has kept 104 clean sheets in his senior career at Ajax and Inter, averaging a shutout approximately every two-and-a-half games. Last campaign he boasted a 76.4% save percentage, showcasing his sharp reflexes and strong hands.  His 255 appearances at club level highlight his wealth of experience, especially considering he missed nine months of football after failing a drugs test, while his trophy cabinet points to a proven winner. Onana claimed two titles in his first season in Italy - the Coppa Italia and Supercoppa Italiana - and also won six pieces of silverware during his time at Ajax, including three Eredivisie crowns.  Club Appearances Goals conceded Clean sheets Inter 41 36 19 Ajax 214 192 85 feed After initially seeing a Â£38.5m bid rejected for Onana, there seems to be a large discrepancy between what United are offering and Inter's valuation of the player. The Italian side have always maintained that they would like upwards of Â£50m for the 34-cap international. United's second bid was made up of an upfront fee of Â£38.5m with Â£4.3m in potential add-ons and it is believed that Inter are still not content with such an offer. It is acknowledged that a fee of under Â£50m could now be reached with Inter keen to progress the deal quickly, although the structure of such a transfer may prove pivotal. Onana is eager to make the move to the Premier League and United are his priority choice despite links with Chelsea some time back. It appears his wishes will be granted imminently. "
Harry Kane to Chelsea? Mauricio Pochettino responds to transfer rumour,"Jul 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/harry-kane-chelsea-mauricio-pochettino-transfer,"Pochettino has taken over at Spurs' bitter London rivals, tasked with turning things around in west London after a disastrous 2022/23 campaign saw the Blues finish 12th. Heavy, heavy spending went unrewarded as Thomas Tuchel and Graham Potter were both sacked over the course of the season - Chelsea finished the campaign with Frank Lampard in caretaker charge. The summer transfer window has seen Chelsea ship out a number of players from their bloated squad - N'Golo Kante, Kalidou Koulibaly, Kai Havertz, Mateo Kovacic, Edouard Mendy, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Mason Mount and Cesar Azpilicueta have all left and will shortly be followed by Christian Pulisic - and Pochettino is acutely aware that he has a number of things still to address. In his opening press conference, the Argentine was inevitably asked about potential incomings at Chelsea, with Harry Kane among those to be mentioned. But Pochettino remained respectful of his situation at Spurs, distancing himself from the speculation of a potential transfer while communicating his belief at how good the 29-year-old is. ""I don't like to talk about players in another club, but you are talking about one of the greatest, one of the best strikers in the world. Itâs not fair to talk, itâs not fair to say nothing,"" Pochettino said. feed ""People are not stupid, fans are not stupid, they are so clever and they know my relationship with him was always amazing. I saw him when he was young, grow up and achieve all he was achieving and of course, we have a great relationship. At the moment we are thinking in different ways. We are not thinking about that.  ""Of course, working hard to try to provide the squad with good qualities. I donât like to talk about players and more than that players who were close to me."" Kane has just one year remaining on his Tottenham contract and 90min understands that he's reluctant to sign a new deal at this stage. Bayern Munich have courted Kane all summer long, while Manchester United were interested before learning of Spurs chairman Daniel Levy's Â£100m+ asking price. England's captain currently sits on 213 Premier League goals, the second most ever, and trails Alan Shearer's record of 260 by just 47 - something he could achieve in the next two years if he continues scoring at the rate he has done over the past nine seasons."
Barcelona set to confirm Vitor Roque signing despite late interest,"Jul 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-to-confirm-vitor-roque-signing,"The Catalan giants have agreed a deal worth â¬40m for the 18-year-old, who made his senior international debut for Brazil in March, but don't intend for him to arrive at Camp Nou until 2024. There had been suggestions that Athletico were not prepared to wait until next year, instead pushing Barcelona to complete the transfer this summer. 90min understands that remains an option if last season's La Liga winners can generate cash through player sales, but the move will otherwise go through as planned. Arsenal, Tottenham, Chelsea and Bayern Munich all made contact with Athletico, 90min further understands, to ascertain whether a deal was still there to be done, but Roque has long decided that he wants to join Barcelona. Roque has agreed a contract until 2028 and is scheduled to link up with Barcelona in January, which could provide Xavi with some much needed firepower for the second half of next season. feed Barcelona anticipate having cleared space on their wage bill by that point, with a number of players on the chopping block this summer as president Joan Laporta looks to balance the club's delicate financials. ""I hope he will become my teammate at Barcelona. We're talking about a high quality football player. He'd help Barca a lot,"" Brazil international team-mate Raphinha recently said of Roque - ironically the winger could be one of the players ushered out of the door if a suitable bid is received. Raphinha wants to stay at Barcelona for the long-term, as does Ferran Torres, but sources have confirmed to 90min that the club are in no position to turn down offers if they come in. Ansu Fati is in a similar situation while Ousmane Dembele, who is a player Xavi considers to be 'untouchable', may also see his future analysed interest from Paris Saint-Germain. As for Roque, he has already helped Brazil win the South American Under-20s Championship, and was also named in the 2022 Copa Libertadores Team of the Tournament."
Football transfer rumours: Dortmund want Sancho back; Mbappe to Real Madrid agreed,"Jul 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/football-transfer-rumours-dortmund-sancho-mbappe-real-madrid-agreed-8-7-23,manual
Five defensive midfielders Barcelona should be trying to sign this summer,"Jul 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/five-defensive-midfielders-barcelona-should-trying-sign-this-summer,"For the last 15 years, Busquets' metronomic vision and control have been integral to Barcelona's identity. His loss is a huge one which is perhaps only exceeded by Lionel Messi's exit in 2021. Manager Xavi has spoken openly about the importance of signing a new defensive midfielder this summer. Ilkay Gundogan has arrived to bolster further forwards, but at the base of midfield, questions remain. While Frenkie de Jong can take the role, the Dutchman would be wasted in such a position and so Barcelona should be looking to dip their toes into the transfer market, although their woeful financial situation will severely limit their options. With all that in mind, here are five players Barcelona should be looking at. A cheap, plug-and-play option would be 31-year-old Oriol Romeu, whose release clause of under â¬10m immediately makes him an appealing prospect. Romeu spent this past season shining at the base of a Girona midfield that was among La Liga's most exciting, and while he might not be a perfect replacement for Busquets, there's no denying he can do a job at a high level. At 31, he'd be a short-term solution but Barcelona may actually prefer that. After all, finding the right player for this role is crucial and there's no point rushing this decision if the perfect candidate is not currently attainable. As a former La Masia graduate, Romeu already knows the DNA of Barcelona and is one of a limited number of options who wouldn't need time to get up to speed. The World Cup was perhaps the best thing to happen to Sofyan Amrabat as the Morocco star used the global stage to raise his profile tenfold. After impressing in Qatar, Amrabat's performances have continued to attract plenty of praise. He's an excellent passer who loves to sit deep and pull the strings, which is the simplest essence of the Busquets role. With just 12 months left on his contract and a clear stance that he will not be renewing, Amrabat looks likely to be sold this summer and will likely be available on the cheap as a result. Reports have suggested Amrabat is prioritising a move to Barcelona over interest from a number of other suitors, so the Blaugrana may not even need to work hard to get this one over the line. feed As far as replacements for Busquets go, there are few players who look more suited for the role than Real Sociedad's Martin Zubimendi. The 24-year-old is incredibly intelligent and looks exactly like the sort of player Barcelona want to build around, and club officials are well aware of that. They've been looking at Zubimendi for months, but all that research has unearthed a real problem - his release clause. Sociedad do not want to let him go and will therefore direct any suitors to his â¬60m release clause, which is a reasonable figure for someone of Zubimendi's talent but also wildly out of Barcelona's budget. If they can sell enough players to raise the money, or perhaps even offer those players to Sociedad in exchange, this is a deal worth pursuing. Spanish sides are never scared to pluck talents from South America, and that bravery should see them move for Boca's Alan Varela. A composed defender who has already mastered the art of scanning, Varela looks like a future superstar in this role. Barcelona could easily put the finishing touches on his game and turn him into an elite midfielder. He's obviously an enormous risk, having never played outside of Argentina, but Varela's play style is a fascinating one which echoes a lot of what fans have grown to love from Busquets. A number of teams from across Europe have taken notice of Varela's skill set and he may not be on the market for much longer. For a team in Barcelona's perilous financial position, this may be the final chance they have to sign Varela. A centre-back by trade, Hugo Guillamon has been pushed into a defensive midfield role in the past few years, and although his transition hasn't been perfect, the 23-year-old has shown more than enough to convince Barcelona of his worth. Smart in possession and more than happy to help out in defence, Guillamon is an intriguing option who has often been used in defence on the international stage because of the sheer level of competition in defensive midfield.  Guillamon is under contract until 2026 but Valencia's well-known financial struggles mean nearly any player can be picked up on the cheap, so this is a real opportunity for Barcelona to bag themselves a bargain. Xavi would need to afford Guillamon time to adjust to such a high level, but the rewards of doing so could be huge."
Chelsea agree fee with AC Milan over Christian Pulisic,"Jul 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-agree-fee-ac-milan-christian-pulisic,"The American winger had received an approach from Ligue 1 side Lyon but was solely focused on moving to Milan, with Chelsea recently agreeing to drop their asking price to encourage a second bid from the Rossoneri. Sources have now confirmed to 90min that an agreement has been reached over a fee which is understood to sit around the Â£20m mark, including bonuses, to take Pulisic to San Siro this summer. Milan agreed personal terms with Pulisic earlier this month and are now set to close the deal in the coming days. The two clubs have already done business this summer, with Ruben Loftus-Cheek making the move in June, and now Pulisic is set for a reunion with both the midfielder and Chelsea academy graduate Fikayo Tomori. feed A medical has now been scheduled for Pulisic who, if all goes to plan, will see his four-year association with Chelsea come to an end this summer. Pulisic joined Chelsea in January 2019 for a fee of Â£58m, remaining with Borussia Dortmund for the next six months before eventually moving to Stamford Bridge, but the 24-year-old has struggled with both form and fitness during his time in London. He has managed 145 appearances in all competitions, chipping in with 26 goals and 21 assists, but rarely saw an extended run of starts. Pulisic, whose Croatian passport helps Milan meet their non-EU rules, enjoyed an excellent post-lockdown streak in the second half of the prolonged 2019/20 campaign, bagging four goals and four assists in nine outings, and will now hope to bring that form to Milan.

Man Utd hold talks with Atalanta over Mason Greenwood loan deal,"Jul 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-talks-atalanta-mason-greenwood-loan-deal,"Greenwood has been suspended by United since January 30, 2022, after being charged with attempted rape, engaging in controlling and coercive behaviour and assault.  Charges against Greenwood were dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service in February but the player remained suspended by United for the remainder of last season, as the club conducted an internal investigation. The 22-year-old is contracted to United until June 2025 with the club holding an option to extend that contract by a further year. United have been considering how to proceed with the 21-year-old and 90min has learned United have held discussions with Atalanta over potentially sending the player on loan to Serie A, those discussions coming during talks between the two clubs over the potential transfer of primary United striking target Rasmus Hojlund. feed Talks have been held about United's potential purchase of Hojlund with Greenwood sent on loan to Bergamo in part exchange, though it's understood that Atletico Madrid have enquired about Greenwood and Borussia Dortmund have held interest. Greenwood has been pictured training on his own in recent weeks and has not returned to United for the commencement of their pre-season. United have pursued a deal for Hojlund in recent weeks after being deterred in their pursuit of England captain Harry Kane by Tottenham's refusal to sell. 90min reported in recent days that talks were ongoing with Atalanta over the Danish striker, though their asking price of â¬75m-â¬80m was proving prohibitive - with United looking at a deal in the region of a maximum â¬60m. Talks are ongoing and United are optimistic they are able to strike a deal for Hojlund that suits them before the new season begins. Erik ten Hag and United are also closing in on a deal for Inter goalkeeper Andre Onana, after seeing two bids rejected for the player this week. United have already confirmed the signing of Mason Mount from Chelsea."
Arda Guler confirms decision on loan away from Real Madrid,"Jul 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arda-guler-confirms-decision-loan-real-madrid,"Guler has put pen to paper on a six-year contract with Real and has been assigned the clubâs number 24 shirt for the forthcoming season. But having only turned 18 in February and with just 51 senior club games under his belt, there have already been doubts about his playing time. In a similar position after arriving from Brazil aged 18, Vinicius Junior initially started out with Real Madrid Castilla. Martin Odegaard was younger, just 16, when he joined Los Blancos, but also went down the path of playing games for the junior squad. Within a couple of months his debut season starting, Vinicius was getting first-team chances though. In Madrid to undergo his medical and officially sign his contract at the Bernabeu alongside club president Florentino Perez, Guler was also presented to the media. He was bullish about his hopes amid significant competition for places in midfield. ""I won't leave on loan, this is not an option. I want to stay and play for Real Madrid,"" he said. ""I'm ready to compete and I'm going to earn my position, I'm going to give it everything to earn my place at the club. I want to stay and play here. If I get a chance to play I will take it. I'm not contemplating any other possibility. I've been offered to play and that's what I'm going to do."" feed Guler, a central midfielder, represents the future with Real. Toni Kroos and Luka Modric have each signed new contracts since the end of last season, but at 33 and almost 38 respectively, neither living legend will be part of the squad for much longer. Kroos has often hinted about retiring in 2024. Real had already moved this summer to bring down the age of the group, signing Jude Bellingham in a transfer that could surpass â¬130m. Eduardo Camavinga and Aurelien Tchouameni, 20 and 23 respectively, have also both been signed within the last two years. Guler is looking forward to sharing a dressing room with Modric, while he also has a pre-existing relationship with former Real star Mesut Ozil. ""For me,Â ModricÂ is the best midfielder in the world and I'm going to take this opportunity to learn everything from him. I have a lot of respect for him,"" the teenager said. ""[Ozil] told me thatÂ Real MadridÂ is the greatest club in the world. We have a brotherly relationship and he's always spoken highly of the club and given me good advice."""
Moises Caicedo speaks out on Chelsea transfer interest,"Jul 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/moises-caicedo-speaks-chelsea-transfer-interest,"The Blues are preparing an opening bid for Caicedo but face a battle to convince Brighton to lower their asking price. A price tag of Â£100m has been placed on the Ecuador international's head, with Brighton pointing to Declan Rice's imminent Â£105m move to Arsenal for justification. Chelsea are prepared to pay a huge sum for Caicedo but just how high they will go is unclear, and this is a saga which could easily rumble on all summer. Asked about his time in the spotlight, Caicedo admitted he is enjoying it and doing his best to stay grounded. ""It's a very great emotion,"" he told Maria Jose Flores. ""What guy wouldn't want them to be talking about him? feed ""I know how to handle it. I don't get carried away by emotions. I'm enjoying time with my family for now. There is pressure, but I am calm. I am waiting for whatever God decides. He will know what is best for me."" Caicedo also took the opportunity to talk about fellow Independiente del Valle product Kendry Paez, who will join Chelsea in the summer of 2025 when he turns 18. ""Kendry is a star,"" Caicedo admitted. ""Watching him play is a pleasure. ""It's good to see those talents in Ecuador. We know that we have good youth. I am very happy for him, for everything he is doing, for how he is working. May he continue on the right path and go far. He has the talent."""
Five strikers Man Utd should be trying to sign this summer,"Jul 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/five-strikers-man-utd-should-trying-sign-this-summer,"Wout Weghorst was drafted in on an emergency loan deal in January, providing some relief for Ten Hag, but he was never going to be the long-term solution at Old Trafford. Marcus Rashford scored 30 goals in all competitions to paper over some of the cracks, but Anthony Martial's continued struggles with injuries and form mean the time is now for United to source a proper replacement. Harry Kane and Victor Osimhen have at one time or another been United's top target, but their extortionate asking prices - coupled with the Red Devils' need to complete other business - means moves for them are almost certainly off the table. But a move must be made somewhere, leaving United searching for the next best fit. Here's five strikers who could fit the brief... A player being billed as the next big thing is Atalanta and Denmark striker Rasmus Hojlund. 6'3 tall, built powerfully and very adept with the ball at his feet, Hojlund has only been in Italy for one season after Atalanta snatched him from the clutches of Sturm Graz in August.  But in that short space of time, Hojlund has shown incredible promise and tremendous technical ability, leading his manager Gian Piero Gasperini to describe his quality as ""remarkable"". He's also blindingly quick off the mark and a real danger when running in behind defences - often overlooking a simple pass to a team-mate in favour of taking on the opposition. Hojlund likes getting involved in play, dropping deep to link up with midfield, and his aggressive style, coupled with his appetite for pressing, appears to align with what Ten Hag is looking for. The goals are not there yet - the Dane scored just nine in Serie A last season - but it feels like a matter of time before he starts tearing defences apart. Indeed, six goals on the international stage - including a hat-trick against Finland in Copenhagen - indicates Hojlund's time is coming. Dusan Vlahovic is another striker currently plying his trade in Serie A, but things have not turned out as many thought they would when the Serb rocked up at Juventus. The 23-year-old scored 44 goals in 98 games for Fiorentina - form that convinced Juve to part with â¬70m and an expensive four-and-a-half year contract. But amid rumours of a broken down relationship with manager Max Allegri, Vlahovic scored just 14 times during 2022/23 at a rate of one goal every three games. That may not sound overly positive for Manchester United supporters, but Vlahovic undoubtedly still has huge potential. A clinical finisher, he can fashion opportunities for himself with quick feet and thrives off quick interchanges - attributes that would likely help Rashford maintain his levels from last season and draw the best from Bruno Fernandes. It's increasingly likely Vlahovic will be available to move this summer, so United may end up thinking he's too good to overlook. feed Benjamin Sesko is a player Manchester United have been tracking for a number of months, even though he's just rocked up in Germany to join RB Leipzig from sister club Salzburg. The 20-year-old has been tipped to go to the very top of the game - drawing comparisons with Erling Haaland's rapid rise - and his â¬24m move to Leipzig suggests there's confidence from coaches that he may just do that. Sesko stands 6'5 tall, inevitably making him a huge threat in the penalty area. But his physical presence and aerial dominance is supplemented by a tremendous shot on goal, while he's also not afraid to press opposition defences and drop deep to link up play. Prising him away from Leipzig would appear to be impossible, but there was significant talk of United, and others, looking to offer the Bundesliga outfit a rapid profit.  With Cristiano Ronaldo's benching at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar stealing the headlines, Portugal needed some inspiration from elsewhere to turn an overwhelming negatively situation back into a positive. Enter, Goncalo Ramos. A hat-trick against Switzerland later followed, in a domestic season where Ramos really flourished for Benfica. Filling the boots of Darwin Nunez, who had departed for Liverpool, the 22-year-old scored 19 Primeira Liga goals and 27 in all competitions to establish himself as one of Europe's finest young guns. Ramos is a hard worker, physically strong and able to get around the pitch, and also an intelligent footballer who gets into good goalscoring positions. He also appears to have tremendous composure - something you need in spades to cope with the pressure of playing for United. After five seasons at Inter, Lautaro Martinez appears to be nearing the end of his journey at San Siro amid interest from some of Europe's biggest clubs. Chelsea are among those taking a keen interest in the Argentine World Cup winner, no doubt because he's just come off the back of the best goalscoring season of his career. Martinez bagged 28 goals in all competitions for Inter, but it's his ability to play as an advanced forward or in a more withdrawn role that should peak the interest of United. Martinez makes smart runs, in behind and out into the channels, and has tremendous awareness of what's going on around him. The 25-year-old's movements are subtle but also generate space for others to flourish. He previously forged one of world football's most devastating strike duos alongside Romelu Lukaku, but has shown he can play the lead role up front on his own. Martinez feels ready to take on a new challenge, and even though his asking price would be at the higher end of United's budget, his credentials speak for themselves."
PSG confirm Manuel Ugarte signing from Sporting CP,"Jul 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-confirm-manuel-ugarte-signing-sporting-cp,"The 22-year-old is an eight-time Uruguay international and had attracted interest from Premier League side Chelsea before deciding to move to France. PSG wrapped up personal terms with Ugarte in May while the Blues elected to move onto other targets including Moises Caicedo and Romeo Lavia. On his move to the Ligue 1 champions, Ugarte said: ""I'm really happy to take this big step in my career at such a great club. ""I'm going to give my all for Paris Saint-Germain."" Ugarte becomes PSG's third signing in as many days after deals were wrapped up for free agents Marco Asensio and Milan Skriniar. Lionel Messi and Sergio Ramos have departed, while there remains intense speculation over the future of Kylian Mbappe. feed The midfielder will wear the number four shirt in Paris and arrives after two seasons with Sporting where he won the 2021/22 Taca da Liga. Ugarte made 85 appearances for the Portuguese side in total, having previously impressed for Famalicao after breaking through at Fenix in Uruguay. He will be managed by new head coach Luis Enrique in his first club role since leaving Barcelona in 2017. Ugarte was also included in his country's squad for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar but didn't play a competitive minute as Uruguay were knocked out in the group stages."
The 10 most expensive English players of all time,"Jul 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/10-most-expensive-english-players-all-time,"The Premier League's leading clubs as well as an overseas juggernaut in Bayern Munich made their interest in the midfielder well-known, with Arsenal and Man City eventually duelling in a surprisingly entertaining race for Rice's signature. The saga concluded rather swiftly with Arsenal agreeing to smash their record transfer fee to bring Rice to north London and the England international has also become the most expensive British player of all-time. Deep down, Pep Guardiola always knew Stones would evolve into his current imperious iteration when City spent Â£47.5m to sign him from Everton in 2016.Raw but blessed with bags of talent, it hasn't always been plain sailing for Stones in Manchester, but he's now regarded as one of the very best defenders around following another excellent season.His unique hybrid role played a key role in City's treble triumph.  Sterling's Â£47.5m move to Chelsea just misses out on the top ten, but the winger's first major transfer does make the list. The spritely dribbler burst onto the scene under Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool and quickly became regarded as one of the country's brightest talents following an excellent 2013/14 season. He'd spend another year at Anfield before the newly forming monopolisers of the Premier League swooped in 2015.  Arsenal's recruitment has been spot on over the past couple of years and their summer window of 2022 was a watershed period in the club's rise under Mikel Arteta.Brighton defender White was the showpiece signing and it didn't take long for the athletic, technically proficient centre-back to settle in north London. His game was taken to another level in 2022/23 as Arteta successfully converted him into an up and down right-back. Man Utd are synonymous with boasting England's finest talent and the club have continued in their attempts to snag the very best the country's got. However, their hit rate in terms of big-money English signings is pretty poor. While Wan-Bissaka impressed at Crystal Palace, his woes in possession always rendered him a questionable fit for a club of United's stature.The right-back has produced some remarkable defensive performances for the Red Devils, but not enough to justify his Â£50m fee.  Sealed with a handshake ð¤#MUFC United's 2023 summer transfer window kicked off with the Â£60m arrival of Mount from Chelsea. A player that divides opinion, the crafty creator is bound to fit right in at Old Trafford. His supreme athleticism, relentless running out of possession and wily positioning render him a distinct upgrade for Erik ten Hag in midfield. United supporters will hope he doesn't endure a similar fate to the vast majority of the club's priciest arrivals. feed The dullest of transfer sagas that spanned several windows concluded with Sancho joining United for just shy of Â£73m.The Englishman dazzled in the space haven that is the Bundesliga with Borussia Dortmund, but Sancho is yet to marvel in the Premier League. Sure, he perhaps hasn't been given the best conditions to excel, but time is seemingly running out for the creative wide man to shine.  While Maguire had stood out in the top flight with Hull and Leicester, very few regarded the vintage centre-half as a Â£78m defender. Supreme in the air and comfortable enough in possession, Maguire is a good defender who has persistently impressed for the national team. However, his struggles defending in a high line has seen his flaws manifest at Old Trafford with Ten Hag reducing his minutes during his first season at the club. The aura of a superstar. Bellingham has long been destined for stardom and he couldn't have picked a better club to harbour his development than Borussia Dortmund. The midfielder evolved from a boy into a man at BVB, with his majestic work on the field catching the eye of the footballing world. Bellingham's now a fully fledged England international and is poised to develop into Real Madrid's next Galactico after joining for Â£88.5m. The loveable wide man put Aston Villa on his back and steered them to Premier League safety during the 2019/20 season before enjoying another productive campaign in 2020/21.A big move away from Villa Park became inevitable and Man City opted to splash what was then a British record fee to bring Grealish and his bulging calves to the Etihad. After a quiet debut season, Grealish was excellent in year two as City claimed a historic treble.  Grealish's transfer record lasted just two summers. Arsenal's core is tinged with supreme English talent and Mikel Arteta firmly believes Declan Rice could be the transformative signing that could catapult the Gunners to Premier League glory.A hotly-contested race for Rice's signature concluded with Arsenal paying a British record Â£105m to prise the midfielder away from West Ham's grasp.  Rank Player Joined Fee 1. Declan Rice Arsenal Â£105m 2. Jack Grealish Man City Â£100m 3. Jude Bellingham Real Madrid Â£88.5m 4. Harry Maguire Man Utd Â£78m 5. Jadon Sancho Man Utd Â£72.9m 6.

Inter Miami to sign Jordi Alba on a free transfer ,"Jul 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/inter-miami-to-sign-jordi-alba-free-transfer,"The Major League Soccer side began pursuing the Spaniard weeks ago, after Alba confirmed his departure from Barcelona following the expiration of his contract. He leaves La Liga with 459 appearances to his name over the course of 11 years. Heâs the latest bombshell signing for Inter Miami, who have decided to revamp their roster during the leagueâs Secondary Transfer Window. The Herons first announced Lionel Messi on June 7, after the player revealed his commitment to feature for the Eastern Conference team in a televised interview.Â  ""I made the decision that I am going to go to Miami,"" Messi said. ""I still haven't closed it one hundred percent. I'm missing some things but we decided to continue the path."" Inter Miami then confirmed the arrival of Sergio Busquets a couple weeks later, before revealing Gerardo âTataâ Martino as the newest head coach to lead the Barcelona duo. Now, Alba will join his former team-mates in the hunt for the MLS Cup.Â  The three played together in La Liga from 2012 to 2021, winning five league titles, six Copa del Rey trophies and one Champions League trophy. The reinforcements will serve Miami well, as they sit in last place of the Eastern Conference table with a mere 17 points in 20 games and a 5W-13L-2D record. The team is almost mathematically disqualified from reaching the MLS playoffs, unable to climb to one of the top nine places on the table.Â "
Real Madrid transfers: Positions Los Blancos must strengthen before summer deadline,"Jul 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/real-madrid-transfers-positions-strengthen-before-summer-deadline,"One area that needed some attention was midfield, but Jude Bellingham arrived from Borussia Dortmund very early in the window to tick that box.  They have also secured a deal for Turkish youngster Arda Guler who can provide cover in the attack and the midfield if he is not loaned out.  There remain areas that need addressing for Los Blancos as the summer wears on and they will need to start moving fairly swiftly. The good news is a lot of time in the window remains and few clubs can match Real's pulling power. This is the major transfer Real Madrid need to make. They have lost Karim Benzema who has led the line for many years and the current strikers in the squad won't do the job all year long. They signed Joselu who has to be viewed as a depth option, but right now he is the only proper striker around.  The two major central forwards on the market this summer are Harry Kane and Victor Osimhen. Kane seems much closer to Bayern Munich and Manchester United remain an option, while no club is closing in on Osimhem yet and the Serie A champions may be unable to fend Real off if a bid near â¬150m comes in. It's a bit of a surprise Real haven't been more heavily linked with either striker, but something has to change in the coming weeks. Lille's Jonathan David has also been mentioned but, while very highly rated, it's hard to picture Real starting a new season without an elite striker. A loan for Dusan Vlahovic is an option as a stop-gap before Kylian Mbappe's possible arrival next summer. This is not an area Real need massive new signings in, but they do need bodies. Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo are the current first choice wingers but depth is lacking after that. Brahim Diaz is back but more of a central figure, while Federico Valverde and Lucas Vazquez have fill in when necessary. The idea of a move suddenly being made for Mbappe can't be fully ruled out, while Bernardo Silva is open to leaving Manchester City though is being pursued by Paris Saint-Germain. Villarreal's Samuel Chukwueze is another winger that could make sense, but AC Milan are pushing hard to sign the Nigerian who has one year left on his contract. feed The major name that has been mentioned at left back is Alphonso Davies.  This was a problem position for Carlo Ancelotti last season with Ferland Mendy out of action with a long-term injury. He will be back on the scene next season, but more depth and quality would be ideal. Fran Garcia is now back at the club and can play there, but the opportunity to secure a player like Davies would hardly be a bad idea for Real. There has to be a future without Dani Carvajal and that future is arriving quickly. Alvaro Odriozola is expected to leave this summer and while there are players who can provide depth at right back in the squad, fresh quality could be required. There are quite a lot of available right backs out there for a club like Real Madrid, with Kyle Walker a genuine possibility. Reece James may also be open to a move away from Chelsea this summer and the idea of bringing Achraf Hakimi back from PSG is also not being ruled out."
Football transfer rumours: Real Madrid offer Mbappe mega deal; Man Utd maintain Raya interest,"Jul 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/football-transfer-rumours-real-madrid-mbappe-man-utd-raya-7-7-23,manual
Real Madrid's stance on Federico Valverde transfer amid widespread interest,"Jul 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/real-madrid-stance-federico-valverde-transfer-liverpool-chelsea-man-city-bayern-munich,"Valverde is widely regarded as one of Real's most important players following a breakout season, but speculation over his future has ensued given summer arrivals of Jude Bellingham and Arda Guler, and the ongoing possibity of also signing PSG superstar Kylian Mbappe. Yet sources close to Real have insisted to 90min that selling the 24-year-old is not in their plans. They would not entertain a sale any time soon and point to the fact he has a â¬1bn release clause in his current contract that runs until 2027. feed Real's stance on the matter has still not stopped other clubs taking an interest and asking about his availability. 90min understands that Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City have enquired this summer, along with Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain - but none of those informal approaches were received positively and were immediately dismissed. Valverde's representatives have also been contacted by the interested parties, but they have been quick to relay the message straight from the player that he has no desire to move. Valverde's wife has just given birth to their second child and he has no desire to uproot his family out of Madrid. A sources close to the player has also informed 90min that he one day sees himself as a future Real captain and that he could imagine spending the rest of his career with the Spanish giants - that potentially means another decade or more at the Santiago Bernabeu. Valverde has been with Madrid for seven years already after joining them from Penarol and has already amassed more than 200 appearances since making his first-team debut in 2018."
"Liverpool, Arsenal & Chelsea shaping up for transfer battle over Southampton star","Jul 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-arsenal-chelsea-shaping-up-transfer-battle-southampton-romeo-lavia,"90min understands that, as it stands, Southampton firmly believe their valuation in excess of Â£50m is fair price. More importantly, they also think it is an attainable number given the interest that is emerging in the teenage Belgian international.  Leading suitors Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea all have Lavia on their respective lists.  Liverpool have already made in-roads into their midfield overhaul with the signings of Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai, but they want more. They have looked closely at the likes of Nice's Khephren Thuram, Borussia Monchengladbach's Manu Kone and Ryan Gravenberch of Bayern Munich - but Lavia with his existing Premier League experience is now under consideration. Arsenal are set to announce the signing of Declan Rice, but with Granit Xhaka set to leave and the futures of Thomas Partey and Jorginho far from certain, they have plans to further bolster their midfield. Those plans include Lavia and 90min revealed last month they have already held talks. feed Chelsea are going for Moises Caicedo and are preparing to make an opening offer, as 90min has revealed. But they are still looking at other options as their midfield is in need of a boost in numbers following the departures of Mason Mount, Mateo Kovacic, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and N'Golo Kante. Chelsea also have Joe Shields, co-Director of Recruitment and Talent, who was the man who took Lavia to Southampton from Manchester City last summer, prior to taking a job at Stamford Bridge, and he is pushing hard for his new club to make an approach. Aside from Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea, there is further interest in Lavia. 90min understands that his former club Manchester City - who have a buy-back in 2024 - are being kept aware of the situation, along with Manchester United and Newcastle, who could very well open talks too. However, all the clubs interested are believed to be unsure of Southampton's current Â£50m+ valuation of the player - the Saints only paid Â£10m plus another Â£4m in add-ons for Lavia. As it stands it is not believed any club is willing to reach that mark. 90min understands that Lavia and his team have so far not indicated any preference as to where he wants to move, but they are very happy with the extent and calibre of the clubs interested. Lavia wants his future resolving before the start of the season as he isn't keen to play in the Championship."
Inter chief confirms stance on Romelu Lukaku signing and Andre Onana sale,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/inter-romelu-lukaku-signing-andre-onana-sale,"30-year-old Lukaku spent the 2022/23 on loan at Inter, returning to the club where he formed a formidable strike partnership with Lautaro Martinez, and scored 14 goals in all competitions as the Nerazzurri reached the Champions League final. 90min recently revealed that Inter and Chelsea, Lukaku's parent club, were close to agreeing a deal that would send the Belgian back to San Siro once more, with the Blues willing to sanction a loan deal with an obligation to buy. Chelsea had been been to sell Lukaku on a permanent basis this summer, but recognise that Inter's precarious financial situation means only a loan will be possible. Lukaku has publicly stated his desire to return to Milan already, and sporting director Ausilio has now confirmed Inter's intention to return him to the club. âLukaku is one of our important objectives. The whole sporting department wants him at Inter,"" Ausilio said. âBut for now heâs a Chelsea player. The dialogue remains open. They donât want to send the player on loan. They said we must buy him. So we are now evaluating whether there is a possibility to sign him outright. âI donât like talking about priorities. Lukaku knows very well that we want to bring him back here. Letâs see if we can find a solution.â  feed Inter have already rejected one bid from United worth a total of â¬45m, but United have returned with an improved offer in the hope of landing the Cameroonian international. It's believed that Inter are unlikely to accept United's latest offer - they value Onana at closer to â¬60m - but there could be a compromise found in order to ease the Italian giants' financial concerns. Prior to the bid being received, Ausilio revealed that United were yet to present an offer that ""met expectations"" and confirmed there would be no movement until Inter were entirely satisfied. âRight now, Onana is Interâs goalkeeper. Heâs one of the strengths of the team and we would like to continue with strong players,"" he said. âIf opportunities arise, weâll evaluate and listen, but up till now, they havenât arrived or havenât met our expectations. âOnanaâs topic ends here. The pre-season starts on July 13 and he will rejoin the group. If something comes up in the next 15-20 days, we will evaluate it. Right now there are no dates or deadlines or the desire to deprive ourselves of any player.â"
Manchester City pushing to finalise Josko Gvardiol agreement,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/manchester-city-pushing-finalise-josko-gvardiol-agreement,"The 21-year-old has emerged as one of City's primary transfer targets this summer, and talks have been ongoing with Leipzig over a deal that would make the Croatian the most expensive defender of all time. Personal terms are all but agreed with Gvardiol, who has made it clear to Leipzig that he wants to join the champions of Europe. Leipzig have publicly stated that City will need to fork out close to â¬100m (Â£86m) plus add-ons in order to land Gvardiol, and last season's treble winners recognise that they will need to make him the most expensive defender ever, eclipsing the Â£80m fee neighbourhood rivals Manchester United paid Leicester for Harry Maguire in 2019. If and when the deal is finalised, Gvardiol will become City's second most expensive acquisition - Jack Grealish's Â£100m move from Aston Villa being the current club record. feed 90min understands that City feel a deal is close, but it is the overall structure of payments that still needs to be ironed out. Nevertheless, there is an expectation from all parties that a deal will be completed before City travel to Asia for a pre-season tour later this month - their first game is in Tokyo against Yokohama F. Marinos on July 23rd. Leipzig, while standing firm on their valuation, are already sourcing potential replacements for Gvardiol, and sources have confirmed that talks are at advanced stage with Feyenoord over Dutch defender Lutsharel Geertruida. The highly-rated 22-year-old is valued in excess of â¬25m by the Eredivisie champions, who have already turned down two bids from Leipzig. But Geertruida is believed to have accepted the personal terms on offer to him in the Bundesliga and is keen to make the move."
West Ham exploring Denis Zakaria loan deal; Gianluca Scamacca no closer to exit,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-denis-zakaria-loan-gianluca-scamacca,"Rice will undergo a medical with Arsenal on Friday after the Hammers agreed a deal worth Â£105m, a record transfer for a British player, to bring to an end to weeks of speculation. The 24-year-old's exit should give West Ham plenty of wiggle room in the transfer market, with the club fully intending to strengthen their squad after qualifying for next season's Europa League. Talks are advancing between West Ham and Leicester over wide forward Harvey Barnes, although a deal is complicated by strong interest from Newcastle and Aston Villa, while there's also genuine interest in Ajax's Edson Alvarez, who saw a move to Borussia Dortmund break down recently. Joao Palhinha, Kalvin Phillips and Amadou Onana are three other players West Ham have identified as potential Rice replacements, but sources have confirmed to 90min that a loan deal for Zakaria, with an option to buy, is being strongly considered. Zakaria has played just 15 times for Juventus in all competitions after joining from Borussia Monchengladbach in January 2022, and spent last season on loan at Chelsea. He failed to make much of an impact though, appearing in just seven Premier League games before returning to Turin. feed The 24-year-old signed a five-year contract at London Stadium last summer, joining from Sassuolo in a deal worth around Â£35m. But the Italian has struggled to make an impact at West Ham and struggled with injuries in his debut season. Scamacca featured in just 16 Premier League games, scoring three goals, and appeared to struggle with West Ham's counter attacking style of play, which often saw him isolated as David Moyes set his side up to absorb pressure. Beaten Europa League finalists Roma, who are managed by Jose Mourinho, are interested in signing Scamacca after Tammy Abraham suffered a nasty ACL tear in the Italian's final Serie A game of 2022/23, initially on loan. But 90min understands that West Ham remain reluctant to sanction an exit for Scamacca, despite his willingness to return to Italy, and will stand their ground until they identify potential replacements. AC Milan and Atalanta are also interested in Scamacca, who earned his move to West Ham after scoring 16 goals for Sassuolo in an impressive 2021/22 season."
Bayer Leverkusen confirm signing of Granit Xhaka from Arsenal,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayer-leverkusen-confirm-signing-of-granit-xhaka-from-arsenal,"The midfielder enjoyed a career best year at Arsenal during the 2022/23 campaign, helping the Gunners to a second place finish in his seventh and final season at the Emirates Stadium.  90min understands that Leverkusen put together a package totalling â¬25m to sign the 30-year-old this summer.  Speaking to the club's official website after making the move, Xhaka said: ""I know the league inside out and I watched it when I was in London. Bayer 04 is a club with an impressive history and ambitious targets. ""Above all, I see it as a club with a great future. Discussions with the management have been incredibly motivating. Everybody here is ambitious and wants to achieve something â I'm very much looking forward to the next few years."" The club's sporting managing director Simon Rolfes also expressed his delight at the signing, saying: ""In Granit we have been able to bring in an absolute top player.""His ability on the pitch is well known. But, above all, there are few players who are able to so convincingly lead a team like he does thanks to his outstanding mentality and personality,"" The news comes ahead of Arsenal's British record-breaking move for Declan Rice nears completion. Arsenal have agreed a Â£100m plus Â£5m in add-ons fee in order to sign the England international from West Ham United this summer, with a medical scheduled to be completed on Friday. "
Chelsea continue Christian Pulisic exit talks with AC Milan; Rayan Cherki & Gabri Veiga on shortlist,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-continue-christian-pulisic-exit-talks-ac-milan-rayan-cherki-gabri-veiga,"Pulisic has received proposals from both Milan and French side Lyon but is prioritising a move to the Rossoneri and is now believed to have reached a full agreement over personal terms with Milan, even accepting a reduction on his current wage to try and push the move through. Chelsea are keen to part ways with Pulisic and are now looking for a fee of around Â£20m, having lowered their asking price in search of a compromise with Milan.  The Rossoneri have also increased their initial proposal after Lyon lodged a superior bid but, as 90min reported at the time, Pulisic's preference is to move to Milan and everyone involved is now looking to get an agreement over the line. While talks with Lyon may not lead to a deal for Pulisic, Chelsea did use the occasion to voice their interest in 19-year-old midfielder Rayan Cherki, who 90min understands has long been followed by those in charge at Stamford Bridge. feed Elsewhere, Chelsea continue to look at their midfield options. Brighton's Moises Caicedo is a top priority and 90min understands a bid for the Ecuador international is being prepared, but there are plans to add another new face in that area of the pitch as well. Celta Vigo's Gabri Veiga is of interest to the Blues but there is significant competition for the Spain Under-21 international, who is admired by PSG, Manchester City, Liverpool and Newcastle, among others. A decision is not expected to be made until towards the end of pre-season, however, with new manager Mauricio Pochettino keen to see whether any of the current crop of young midfielders at the club are ready to make an immediate impact. Brazilian Andrey Santos is attracting significant loan interest from across Europe but is expected to be given the chance to impress in pre-season, while decisions will have to be made on Carney Chukwuemeka and Cesare Casadei. Casadei, whose only senior football came in a six-month loan spell with Reading last season, is likely to be sent on a top-flight loan move this time around."
Dusan Vlahovic increasingly likely to leave Juventus,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/dusan-vlahovic-increasingly-likely-leave-juventus,"Vlahovic has been heavily linked with a move away from La Vecchia Signora in recent months, and Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Chelsea all retain an interest in the Serbian striker's services. 90min reported in May that the Red Devils see Vlahovic as a 'first box' striker option this summer alongside Harry Kane, Victor Osimhen and Lautaro Martinez, while Chelsea see the player as a viable alternative to Osimhen if a move for the Napoli striker fails to materialise.  Sources confirmed to 90min at the start of June that Vlahovic had requested to leave the club this summer, and it is understood that manager Max Allegri has given his blessing to sanction the player's move. In order to sell the Serbian, Juve are keen to recoup the â¬70m they spent on him back in January 2022 when he turned down the opportunity to sign for Arsenal in favour of a move to the Allianz Stadium.  With Vlahovic increasingly likely to leave, Juventus are now looking a potential replacements for the 23-year-old.  La Vecchia Signora have spoken to representatives of both Rasmus Hojlund and Jonathan David thus far, although the price tags placed on both players could be a deterrent for any move.  Hojlund enjoyed a breakthrough season with Atalanta in 2022/23, scoring 10 goals in all competitions and becoming one of the most sought-after young strikers in Europe, while David scored a career-high 24 Ligue 1 goals with LOSC Lille.  feed Another Juve star who has been heavily linked with a move away from Turin this summer is Federico Chiesa. The wide player featured sporadically since returning from a lengthy injury lay-off, making just six Serie A starts during the 2022/23 season.  90min understands that, as things stand, the player is more likely than Vlahovic to remain at Juventus however his future ultimately depends on how much interest emerges for his services.  Sources have stated that Juve are currently drawing up a list of potential replacements for the winger if he does leave. "
Inter tell Man Utd to raise Andre Onana offer despite receiving improved bid,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/inter-man-utd-raise-andre-onana-offer-improved-bid,"The Italian giants had already rejected one approach from United worth a total of â¬45m (Â£38.5m), but talks have continued between the two parties. United returned to the negotiating table with a second offer, this time worth â¬45m in guaranteed money plus â¬5m in add-ons, but Inter have made it clear that the 13-time Premier League winners must come closer to their â¬60m (Â£51m) valuation. Sources indicate that the two clubs may end up meeting between the two amounts in order to close a deal, with Inter's precarious financial situation meaning they must sell players before reinvesting in their squad. Onana has been established by Erik ten Hag as his top goalkeeping target after United withdrew a contract offer to last season's first choice, David de Gea - the Spaniard is technically a free agent now that his previous deal has expired. It's expected United will speak to De Gea about his long-term plan but Ten Hag has decided it's important to upgrade in the position this summer if the club can attract the right player for the right price. feed Interest from Saudi Arabia has already been rebuffed by Onana, with the Cameroon international instead keen to reunite with Ten Hag, who was his manager for five years at Ajax. Inter need to raise money to balance their books and recently sold high-earner Marcelo Brozovic to Al Nassr. Davide Frattesi has already replaced him in midfield, but Inter also have ambitions to bring Romelu Lukaku back to San Siro after a loan spell last year. United completed the signing of Mason Mount from Chelsea on Wednesday, in a deal worth up to Â£60m if all add-ons are met, and are keen to add a centre forward to their squad. Atalanta striker Rasmus Hojlund is emerging as one of their key striking targets, with higher value targets such as Harry Kane and Victor Osimhen looking difficult to attain."
Where Dominik Szoboszlai ranks in Liverpool's most expensive transfers,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/where-dominik-szoboszlai-ranks-liverpool-most-expensive-transfers,"Midfield was regarded as the key problem area the club needed to solve and many believe the Reds have already mitigated such woes with the arrivals of Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai. While the club's purchase of World Cup winner Mac Allister may go down as the bargain of the summer, the Reds were forced to pay more to sign Szoboszlai and the Hungarian playmaker is now one of the most expensive signings in Liverpool's history. DS8ï¸â£ pic.twitter.com/qR1sbT8D4d This is a transfer that's been years in the making, but the actual move was quite sudden. Heading into the summer transfer window, Newcastle appeared the most likely destination for Szoboszlai, although Liverpool had registered an interest and they were given a free run at Hungary's captain after the Magpies opted to pursue Sandro Tonali. With Szoboszlai keen to work under Jurgen Klopp, personal terms were never going to be an issue, but this was still a pretty complicated deal to pull off with Liverpool needing to trigger the player's â¬70m release clause by the end of June. RB Leipzig also wanted the majority of this fee paid up front. feed Deemed as a necessity by the Reds boss, however, Liverpool went through with the deal with Fenway Sports Group giving the financial green light. While new sporting director Jorg Schmadtke proved key in smoothing out the major details of the deal, this is a move said to be driven by Klopp, who has tracked Szoboszlai's progress since he faced up against the Reds for RB Salzburg during the 2019/20 Champions League group stages. Rank Player Joined from Fee 1. Darwin Nunez Benfica Â£85.4m 2. Virgil van Dijk Southampton Â£75m 3. Alisson AS Roma Â£65m 4. Dominik Szoboszlai RB Leipzig Â£60.1m 5. Naby Keita RB Leipzig Â£52.75m 6. Luis Diaz Porto Â£50m 7. Diogo Jota Wolves Â£45m 8. Cody Gakpo PSV Â£44m 9. Fabinho  AS Monaco Â£43.7m 10. Mohamed Salah AS Roma Â£43m While several members of the Premier League's big six have struggled when it comes to big-money arrivals, Liverpool have hit the nail on the head more often than not. Out of their ten most expensive arrivals, only Naby Keita was a distinct failure. The midfielder departed the club this summer on a free transfer after five indifferent years at Anfield. While the jury's still out on Darwin Nunez and Cody Gakpo is only a few months into his Liverpool career, the rest have  been brilliant for the Reds. The club smartly used the funds garnered from Philippe Coutinho's monster sale to sign Virgil van Dijk and Alisson, with both playing crucial roles in Liverpool's rise under Klopp. Coming in below Keita is Luis Diaz, who enjoyed a scintillating opening six months on Merseyside before suffering a long-term injury during his second season. Diogo Jota, meanwhile, has been an incredibly handy option for Klopp since joining from Wolves for Â£45m. Rounding off the top ten is Fabinho, another crucial cog in Liverpool's transformation, and Mohamed Salah, a truly great contemporary Red who has scored the joint-fifth highest number of goals in the club's history. Liverpool's track record would suggest it's more likely than not that Szoboszlai, who has become the club's fourth most expensive signing ever, will blossom into a star at Anfield."
Cesar Azpilicueta leaves Chelsea for Atletico Madrid,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/cesar-azpilicueta-leaves-chelsea-atletico-madrid,"The Spaniard had agreed personal terms with Inter and was expected to seal a switch to Serie A before Atletico made a late bid and quickly established themselves as the favourites to get a deal done. Despite still having one year remaining on his contract, Chelsea agreed to grant Azpilicueta a free transfer as a mark of respect to their captain, whose 11-year spell at Stamford Bridge has now come to a close. Before sealing his move, Azpilicueta posted a lengthy farewell message to Chelsea fans, vowing to return to Stamford Bridge in the future. feed Azpilicueta leaves Chelsea having won every major trophy available to him: the Champions League, Europa League, Club World Cup, Super Cup, Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup. The versatile defender, who is primarily a right-back but has performed at a high level both on the left and in the centre, racked up an enormous 508 appearances for Chelsea, chipping in with 17 goals and a respectable 56 assists. He sits sixth on Chelsea's all-time appearances list and played more games for the Blues than any overseas player in their history, 14 ahead of Czech goalkeeper Petr Cech. Azpilicueta now returns to La Liga for the first time since 2010, when he initially left Osasuna for Marseille. He sits on 99 appearances in the division and will hit his century when he makes his debut for Atletico."
Real Madrid confirm Arda Guler signing after winger officially joins PSG,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/real-madrid-arda-guler-signing-winger-joins-psg,"The 18-year-old was one of the most in-demand players around when his â¬17.5m release clause became active and both Real Madrid and Barcelona lodged bids to try and lure Guler away. Guler ultimately chose Real Madrid, whose offer of â¬20m is above Guler's release clause but, importantly, can be paid in instalments. ""Real Madrid CF and FenerbahÃ§e SK have agreed on the transfer of the player Arda Guler, who will be linked to our club for the next six seasons,"" a brief statement read, before confirming his presentation to the media on Friday. Guler, who has four senior caps for Turkey to his name, leaves Fenerbahce after notching 21 goal contributions in 51 appearances, comprised of nine goals and 12 assists. feed Primarily an attacking midfielder, Guler has spent plenty of time out on the wing and will likely help fill the void left behind by the departures of Eden Hazard and Marco Asensio - the latter of whom has been confirmed as PSG's latest signing. Asensio has signed a three-year contract in the French capital after spending eight years at Real Madrid. He won three La Liga titles, three Champions League crowns, four Club World Cups, three UEFA Super Cups, two Spanish Super Cups and last season's Copa del Rey in that time, and is a mainstay in the Spanish national team. To compensate for his departure, Braham Diaz has returned to Real, extending his contract to join Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo in Real Madrid's attacking line. There are still plans to sign a new striker following the departure of Karim Benzema, with PSG's Kylian Mbappe their top target and Tottenham's Harry Kane an option."
Barcelona transfers: Positions La Blaugrana must strengthen before summer deadline,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-transfers-positions-strengthen-before-summer-deadline,"While La Blaugrana again failed miserably in Europe, their stellar domestic form culminated in La Liga glory - their first league title since 2018/19. Despite this success, financial turmoil still envelops the great Catalan club and will vastly restrict the business they can conduct this summer. However, the exits of stalwarts leaves Xavi with multiple holes to fill and BarÃ§a's shrewdness in the market is set to be put to the test given their monetary limitations. Here are three positions Barcelona must look to strengthen before the summer window slams shut. Xavi has a bit of a predicament at right back because his two best performers at the position are centre-backs by trade and one, Jules Kounde, doesn't view his long-term future out on the flank.  Both Kounde and Ronald Araujo performed well at right-back last season when called upon but La Blaugrana are expected to be in the market for another option to appease Kounde. Although, the Frenchman might find it difficult to displace either Araujo or Andreas Christensen at the heart of BarÃ§a's defence. Nevertheless, the club has a long standing interest in former Tottenham defender Juan Foyth, currently at Villarreal, while coveted Real Valladolid full back Ivan Fresneda has also been linked with a move to Catalonia. Joao Cancelo was once talked up as a possibility, but the finances involved render that deal tough to pull off. Fresneda appears to be the number one option at this stage and while he may not usurp Kounde right away, he's got the potential to emerge as a dynamic full back star under Xavi. There's a vast Sergio Busquets-shaped hole that needs to be filled in the dressing room. Barcelona astutely signed treble hero Ilkay Gundogan on a free transfer to get their summer transfer window underway, but Xavi is likely to view the German as a midfielder who'll do greater damage between the lines and closer to the opposition box. Frenkie de Jong's success in a box-to-box role means he's unlikely to be moulded into a single pivot midfielder, while Gavi and Pedri are both better suited to more advanced roles.  BarÃ§a need a bona fide holding midfielder to replace Busquets and they were rumoured to be in for Real Sociedad metronome Martin Zubimendi heading into the summer window. Interest on that front, however, appears to have cooled and former Southampton man Oriol Romeu is now the club's top target after a fine season with Girona. feed The club's purchase of Brazilian sensation Vitor Roque should solve their post-Robert Lewandowski striker issue and Xavi is blessed with several options to deploy down the right flank. On the left, however, the situation is murkier. Ansu Fati looked set to be La Blaugrana's next superstar when he burst onto the scene as a teenager, but injuries have prevented the Spaniard's career from taking off. His future looked to be in doubt this summer, but a promising end to the season should convince the club to retain his services and the 20-year-old could make the left wing spot his own next season should he stay fit. However, Xavi's lack of options last season led to the deployment of an extra midfielder down the left in a bid to establish greater control in central areas. The BarÃ§a boss may continue with this ploy next season, but La Blaugrana are undoubtedly more dynamic with a player of Fati's profile in the side.  If Ferran Torres departs, the club should seek to sign a replacement who could compete with Fati for minutes down the left. "
Man City transfers: Positions the Cityzens must strengthen before summer deadline,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-city-transfers-positions-strengthen-before-summer-deadline,"Based on the evidence of last season, there is very little City need to do in the transfer market. More of the same will be the message from Guardiola, who clinched his 12th major trophy at the Etihad with the club's European success.  However, if you stand still in football you will be sorely punished and City have already made moves in the transfer window this summer. Mateo Kovacic has replaced the departing Ilkay Gundogan, while a deal for RB Leipzig's Josko Gvardiol edges closer to completion. That's a good start for the Sky Blues but let's have a look at where else Guardiola can strengthen his side this summer. With Kyle Walker's contract expiring in just under a year's time and Joao Cancelo seemingly heading out the Etihad exit door, Guardiola could be short on the right-hand side of his defence. If both were to leave, Rico Lewis would be the coach's only option. While City are keen to extend Walker's deal amid interest from Bayern Munich and will likely receive a hefty fee for Cancelo, the European champions will be keen not to leave their dealings too late in the window. Lewis may be a fantastic young talent, but he isn't ready to be starting 50+ games a season for the Cityzens. One man linked with Manchester is Paris Saint-Germain's Achraf Hakimi. A sensationally gifted and attack-minded right back, the 24-year-old would undoubtedly be a great addition to City's ranks, although a transfer would be difficult to pull off due to the Moroccan's high price tag. One of the worst kept secrets in recent transfer windows has been Guardiola's admiration for Leipzig defender Gvardiol. The 21-year-old's meteoric rise to Bundesliga stardom has thrust him into the dazzling spotlight of the transfer merry-go-round and he now seems set for a big-money move to the Premier League champions. The left-footed centre back would command an eye-watering fee, with Leipzig wanting a nine-digit sum for their starlet. Guardiola is never shy of splashing the cash for the right player and given the Croatian defender's age, technical prowess and physicality, he's a no-brainer signing for any club that can afford him. While City appear well-stocked in the centre of defence, Gvardiol's ability to cover Nathan Ake's role as a left-back/centre-back depending on the occasion makes him a desirable asset. Team this with Aymeric Laporte's likely exit in search of more regular minutes and it's obvious why Guardiola is so keen to bring the phenom to Manchester. When Guardiola needs someone to rely on in the big games, he always calls on Bernardo Silva.  This was epitomised in the second leg of the club's Champions League semi-final with Real Madrid last season, with the 28-year-old rewarding his manager's faith with two goals and a stunning all-round performance in a 4-0 victory. However, his time at City may be coming to an end as PSG, Barcelona and clubs in Saudi Arabia attempt to lure him away from the Etihad. While not a traditional central midfielder, often featuring in an attacking role or on the left flank, Silva is more productive in central areas and his versatility has proved crucial to Guardiola.   If the Portugal international is to leave, City will need someone to fill his boots. That, of course, could be Phil Foden who is expected to play in a more central role moving forward, but that would leave Guardiola needing cover on the left wing. Guardiola could call on his compatriot Gabri Veiga to help strengthen City in Silva's absence. The Sky Blues hold an interest in the 21-year-old who enjoyed a sensational season at Celta Vigo last year and a Â£34m release clause makes him an affordable prospect. At that kind of price, Veiga could be one of the value-for-money picks of the summer. feed It is hard to believe Riyad Mahrez will turn 33 in February. The Algerian has never relied on pace, instead using his light frame and excellent close control to punish opponents, chopping in on his favoured left foot and unleashing all the quality he possesses with one stroke. However, the winger's influence is just slightly starting to wane. Less assured of a starting berth, his minutes are naturally being more closely managed due to his advancing age. Mahrez has been linked with a move to Saudi Arabia this summer - albeit like most players - but even if the attacker stays on at the Etihad, City should still be lining up his successor. This becomes even more significant if Silva were to depart as well, leaving the Cityzens short on the right-hand side. A right-sided player who favours his left foot would be required, but there are no reports linking City with an extra forward yet this window. That could all change, however, as the new Premier League season edges closer."

The Scot currently has Said Benrahma, Pablo Fornals and Maxwel Cornet as his options on the left hand side, but is open to moving players on this summer in a bid to freshen things up at London Stadium. Newcastle have a long-standing interest in Barnes, who has been capped once by England, and are willing to move on Allan Saint-Maximin this summer - 90min first reported interest in his services from a number of Saudi Pro League clubs.

The Foxes have already lost James Maddison to Tottenham Hotspur this summer and are resigned to losing more of their leading players after dropping into the second tier. Aston Villa are also keeping a firm eye on developments with Barnes, having secured their own route back into European competition under Unai Emery. The Villans finished seventh in the Premier League last season, a remarkable turnaround after sacking Steven Gerrard last October. West Ham can also offer Barnes continental football, securing their place in next season's Europa League after beating Fiorentina 2-1 in the Conference League final to win a first trophy in 43 years."

A two-year contract is on the table for Azpilicueta, who is in Madrid for medical tests ahead of sealing his exit from Chelsea. Chelsea have granted Azpilicueta a free transfer away from Stamford Bridge as a show of respect to the 33-year-old, who joined in 2012 and has made more appearances for the club than any other overseas player. feed Azpilicueta came close to a return to Spain last year when Barcelona came calling, but the defender instead opted to stay at Chelsea to help steer the Blues through their transition to the BlueCo ownership era. However, with game time now hard to come by for the 33-year-old, Azpilicueta will now be allowed to leave the club and he has chosen Atletico for his new home. Chelsea are already prepared for his departure, bringing in right-back Malo Gusto from Lyon in January, while the returning Levi Colwill will also ensure the Blues are not caught out at centre-back either. Azpilicueta will leave Chelsea with 508 appearances to his name, putting him sixth on the club's all-time appearance charts, and a trophy cabinet full of nine pieces of silverware."
Mason Mount reveals key reason for leaving Chelsea,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/mason-mount-reveals-key-reason-for-leaving-chelsea,"The 24-year-old's 18-year association with the Blues ended on Wednesday as his move to Manchester United, which would eventually be worth Â£60m, was made official. Chelsea had been involved in lengthy contract negotiations with Mount over a new deal, but ultimately the two parties were unable to agree terms on extending his Stamford Bridge stay. Instead, a move to Manchester United came over the horizon, with a deal eventually struck between the Premier League heavyweights at the fourth time of asking. Mount has taken plenty of stick on social media for abandoning Chelsea, but his first interview with his new club has revealed his belief that his time in west London was up. ""Several months ago, it became clear that I wasn't in Chelsea's plans moving forward,"" Mount told United's official website. ""Once I knew that United were involved, my decision was made up. A massive club, huge iconic players have played here, and I wanted to be a part of that from the beginning. Getting in early and ready for pre-season to start was a main objective of mine as well. feed ""The most important thing for me was getting there, being ready on day one and being able to obviously meet all the players, the manager, and get working."" Mount enjoyed a swift rise to prominence after successful loan spells at Vitesse Arnhem and Derby County. He signed a new five-year contract at Chelsea in July 2019 and quickly became a first-team regular under Frank Lampard, who had overseen his loan spell at Pride Park. He also became a regular starter for Gareth Southgate's England, playing a prominent role in the Three Lions' run through to the Euro 2020 final. Four full seasons at Chelsea yielded 195 appearances in all competitions for Mount, with 33 goals scored in that time. But 2022/23 was a real struggle for the Portsmouth-born midfielder, as he contended with various injuries and a noticeable loss of form."
Chelsea beat Man City & Tottenham to signing of Everton teenager Ishe Samuels-Smith,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-beat-man-city-tottenham-to-signing-ishe-samuels-smith,"The young left-back, who is also comfortable in the centre of defence, was a regular feature for Everton's Under-21 side last season and sat on the first-team bench in both the Premier League and Carabao Cup last season. Chelsea attempted to sign Samuels-Smith last summer but failed to get an agreement over the line, but their interest never disappeared and sources have now confirmed to 90min that a deal has been struck with Everton to sign the talented teenager. The Blues have beaten a number of Premier League clubs to his signature, fending off competition from Manchester City, Newcastle and Tottenham to secure Samuels-Smith on a three-year contract - the maximum length for players of his agen feed Born in Manchester, towering left-back Samuels-Smith has long been touted as a potential star of the future.  Both Frank Lampard and Sean Dyche involved the 17-year-old with the Everton first team, and although he failed to make an appearance under either, his inclusion on the bench under two managers serves as an indication of his impact behind the scenes. At international level, Samuels-Smith has represented England up to the Under-17s and was the only member of the Young Lions to feature in the Team of the Tournament at this summer's European Under-17 Championships, where he impressed as an outside centre-back. Left-back has been a problem area for the Chelsea academy for the past few years, with the Blues regularly dipping their toes into the transfer market to try and add depth. 19-year-old Zak Sturge joined from Brighton last summer but ended this past season playing centrally alongside Dylan Williams, who was signed from Derby in January 2022 and made it onto the bench under Thomas Tuchel during an FA Cup victory over Luton Town shortly after his arrival."

Guler has been one of the most talked about young midfielders in Europe ever since he broke through into Fenerbahce's first team in August 2021. He became the youngest goalscorer in the club's Super Lig history soon after, with his displays thereafter earning him the coveted number ten shirt. Should the move to Madrid go through as expected, Guler will join an exciting pool of young players expected to reach the top of the game.

Most expensive English midfielders ever,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/most-expensive-english-midfielders,"In Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, and Paul Scholes, England boasted three of the leading midfielders of their generation. However, the trio rarely succeeded together for the national team and their similar brilliance has since triggered tedious debates over who was superior years after their respective retirements.  It's fair to say England endured a lean spell of producing elite midfield talent in the years succeeding the aforementioned era, but the supreme English box-to-boxers are on the rise again, folks. While Gerrard, Lampard and Scholes stayed wedded to one club for much or the entirety of their careers, the new generation have already racked up mammoth transfer fees.  Here are the ten most expensive English midfielders of all time. Willock completed a permanent transfer to Newcastle off the back of a sensational loan spell during which he scored in seven consecutive games to conclude the 2020/21 campaign.His first season after completing a permanent move was disappointing, but Eddie Howe's arrival offered Willock a new lease of life and he was instrumental in an enterprising box-to-box role for the Magpies last season as they secured a top-four finish.Willock scored three times and added six assists. Now, those bright Champions League lights await. You all laughed at Birmingham, didn't you? However, the club's decision to retire Bellingham's number 22 shirt has certainly been vindicated given the player he's quickly become.Birmingham parted ways with one of their own for a club-record fee, with Borussia Dortmund, revered for their relationship with blossoming young stars, snapping the precocious 17-year-old up for Â£25m.The German club would go on to make quite a tidy profit from his future sale. This signing arrived at a time when Southampton appeared to be no more than a mere feeder club to Liverpool.Lallana was the spiritual hub of the Saints during their return to the Premier League and subsequent stay in the top flight before he made the move to the Reds in 2014.While he never developed into a superstar at Anfield, Lallana ended his Liverpool career having made 178 appearances for the club. Much of his best work on Merseyside arrived before the Reds developed into a juggernaut under Jurgen Klopp. Oxlade-Chamberlain took a more indirect route from Southampton to Liverpool as he enjoyed a six-year stay at Arsenal in between. The Reds paid a sizeable fee for a player deemed disposable by the Gunners at the time, but the versatile midfielder quickly quashed any naysayers by embarking on a stellar debut season at Anfield.However, the rest of Oxlade-Chamberlain's time at Liverpool was hampered by injuries. He missed almost the whole 2018/19 season and, after a playing a bit-part role in the club's Premier League triumph, the midfielder's minutes dwindled before his contract expired in 2023.  After playing a supporting role in Leicester's miracle of 2015/16, Drinkwater moved to Chelsea as part of what became an infamous transfer window for the Blues.Their work in the market in 2016 catapulted them to the title under Antonio Conte, but their 2017 summer window was nothing short of disastrous. Drinkwater was one of several big-money acquisitions that flopped hard at Stamford Bridge. The midfielder, who struggled with injuries, made just 23 appearances for the Blues in five years before leaving on a free transfer in 2022. The first major acquisition of the Ange Postecoglou (apologies, Guglielmo Vicario) era looks to be a bargain. Leicester were once demanding close to Â£80m for the services of Maddison, but the Foxes' relegation to the second tier gave them little leverage when negotiating with interested parties. Tottenham moved quickly to secure their man, who they've liked since his Coventry days, with many supporters labelling Maddison as the club's Christian Eriksen replacement three years in the making. Phillips forged quite the reputation during his time under Marcelo Bielsa at Leeds and he cemented himself as a regular for England at Euro 2020. He'd later be named as the Three Lions' player of the year in 2021.The midfielder's rise culminated in a Â£42m move to Manchester City in 2022, but Phillips is yet to make a name for himself at the Etihad. The 'Yorkshire Pirlo' barely featured as the Citizens claimed a historic treble during his debut season. This was a move that raised plenty of eyebrows. During their summer influx of transfers ahead of their return campaign in the Premier League, Nottingham Forest splashed the cash to acquire the services of talented Wolves youngster Gibbs-White. While the creative midfielder had flashed his talent at Molineux, there was little to suggest he was worth such an extortionate fee.Nevertheless, Gibbs-White proved many wrong in his debut season at the City Ground as he played a starring role in Forest's survival. Bellingham was only briefly the most expensive English midfielder ever after he completed an initial Â£88m move to Real Madrid. The midfielder developed into a superstar at Dortmund and came ever so close to spearheading a title victory in what would prove to be his last at the club.Bellingham's three years in the Ruhr were littered with majesty as he blossomed into one of Europe's leading midfielders. He's bound to shine for both club and country for the next decade.  Bellingham's brief record was broken by Rice, who was courted by several of the Premier League's leading clubs as well as Bayern Munich this summer. Arsenal, though, were long considered the front runners and after Man City failed to match the Gunners' mammoth Â£105m offer, Rice was destined for north London. Mikel Arteta's project at the Emirates has enticed the West Ham skipper, who could potentially be a transformative addition for Arsenal. The Gunners'  belief in Rice couldn't be clearer given the fee they were willing to pay. manual"

Personal terms are not seen as an issue from either side, with the player hopeful of the move, but Chelsea are yet to engage fully with Brighton over terms of a potential deal. Caicedo, who signed a new long-term contract in March after seeing a January move to Arsenal fail to materialise, has made it clear to Brighton that he would like the chance to move on before the new season begins.  The club are open to the prospect of allowing Caicedo to leave - but are determined to achieve what they feel is a fair price for the 21-year-old. Brighton have seen Premier League rivals West Ham agree a British record Â£105m fee with Arsenal for Declan Rice, and sources indicate the club feel Caicedo's fee should be in the same ""ball park"". They are currently holding out for Â£100m and have indicated to the player's camp that they will only sell for a price they deem fair market value. Chelsea, for their part, have done their homework on Caicedo and feel he will be the perfect addition to their midfield - and especially crucial given they have lost the experienced Mason Mount, Mateo Kovacic, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and N'Golo Kante from their midfield so far this summer. feed Caicedo is desired by Chelsea to be a part of their midfield overhaul and 90min understands that even if this deal is finalised, that the Blues could look for more additions in the middle of the pitch. Southampton's Romeo Lavia remains under consideration. The Southampton midfielder is set to be at the centre of a Premier League tug-of-war however, with Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle all showing interest in the player themselves to varying degrees. One new midfielder who has arrived at Chelsea is Andrey Santos. Santos signed in January from Vasco Da Gama, but at that time didn't qualify for a work permit to play in England. The 19-year-old returned to his former club on loan as a result, and has since become a full Brazilian international - he is now eligible to play in the Premier League and has started pre-season training with the Blues. 90min understands that a host of clubs have contacted Chelsea to ask about taking the young international midfielder on loan for the coming season. Portuguese giants Porto have enquired, as have domestic rivals Sporting CP. Both Milan clubs have also expressed an interest in Santos' situation, while there are clubs interested from Germany and France. However, Chelsea sources have told 90min that as it stands new head coach Mauricio Pochettino wants to asses Santos over pre-season. Chelsea have been hugely impressed with Santos' progress in the last six months and feel he could yet feature and contribute in the Premier League."
Arsenal transfers: Positions the Gunners must strengthen before summer deadline,"Jul 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-transfers-positions-strengthen-before-summer-deadline,"The Gunners took an exponential leap in 2022/23 and came somewhat close to lifting their first Premier League title since the Invincibles campaign of 2003/04. A stuttering epilogue meant Manchester City eventually strolled to their third straight crown, but Arteta is determined to knock the Cityzens off their perch next season. Arsenal have been mightily aggressive in the summer window so far. After signing Kai Havertz to a monster pay packet, the club fought off several members of Europe's elite to bring Declan Rice to north London in a British record deal. These two additions, even if Granit Xhaka and Thomas Partey depart, leaves Arsenal's midfield in a distinct position of strength and Jurrien Timber, who's soon expected to join, will supply greater depth in multiple defensive roles. The Gunners are well on their way to building a squad capable of competing with City at the Premier League summit, but there are still a couple of positions that could do with strengthening this summer. Bukayo Saka has established himself as one of the world's best wingers and played a pivotal role in Arsenal's excellent 2022/23 campaign. However, the club's starboy, who appeared in every Premier League game last term, burned out down the stretch for the second season running. Arteta simply didn't trust Saka's deputies, although his options were slim. Reiss Nelson is better off the left, as is Leandro Trossard. There isn't a player in the Arsenal squad that comes close to replicating what Saka does down the right. However, with Arsenal returning to the Champions League next season, Arteta can ill-afford to use Saka as frequently as he has done since succeeding Unai Emery as manager. The poor kid is going to need some respite, but the club must sign somebody the manager trusts to perform the isolated right-winger role to a high enough standard so they can rotate with Saka. Admittedly, signing a player of such quality who'd be happy to play second fiddle will not be easy. Perhaps Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz should see more minutes on the right next season. feed The impending arrival of Timber is such a shrewd one as he can provide cover at right-back, centre-back, left-back, and holding midfield. He's another unicorn talent. Oleksandr Zinchenko is the undisputed number one choice left-back heading into 2023/24 and Arsenal are not going to find an upgrade on the Ukrainian. However, both Kieran Tierney and Nuno Tavares could be on the move this summer which may force Arsenal to dip their toe into the left-back market. While Timber and Takehiro Tomiyasu are capable of performing the inverted role from the opposite flank, signing a full-back with an alternate profile might be wise. If Tierney remains in north London, then there's no need to invest at this position."

They have ambition to bring Romelu Lukaku back to San Siro from Chelsea having lost Edin Dzeko to Fenerbahce on a free transfer. United meanwhile are looking to follow up the signing of Mount, who has been issued the number 7 shirt, with the signing of Onana, though they do have alternatives to fall back on should a deal become too expensive. Atalanta's Rasmus Hojlund is their current top target to bolster their striking options while a second midfielder may also be added to the squad this window, dependent on player sales."

Man Utd pursued the England international heavily following the conclusion of the 2022/23 season and made him a priority target. They had three bids rejected by Chelsea before eventually agreeing to a fee of Â£55m, with a further Â£5m potentially to come in add-ons. manual Mount has signed a five-year contract with the option for a further 12 months and spoke of his excitement at joining Man Utd in his unveiling interview, with football director John Murtough hailing him as 'world class'.

Thomas Tuchel driving Bayern Munich's pursuit of Harry Kane,"Jul 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/thomas-tuchel-bayern-munich-pursuit-harry-kane,"Kane has one year left to run on his contract and talks have stalled over a new deal, while Spurs' incredibly disappointing 2022/23 season has increased speculation of a move away this summer. 90min has long reported that Tottenham are confident of keeping their all-time record scorer and their stance has not changed. Chairman Daniel Levy will currently not entertain bids for Kane and a price tag has not been set or discussed. Spurs are in fact growing in confidence that they can convince Kane to want to stay due to the immediate impact of new head coach Ange Postecoglou, who has made a great impression around the club since confirmation of his appointment last month. But sources have told 90min that Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel believes there is still a chance that Kane could switch clubs in the coming months and is pushing for his signing. The German champions have courted Kane for the last year but their head coach is now driving their interest in the striker, to the extent that Tuchel has convinced Bayern to at least temporarily halt their pursuits of other forward targets such as Eintracht Frankfurt's Randal Kolo Muani. feed Bayern have made no secret of the fact they want to bring in a top-class number nine this window having failed to sign a direct replacement for Robert Lewandowski last summer. 90min recently reported that Tottenham denied they had received an opening â¬70m bid from Bayern, but if they did then it would have been rejected out of hand. Real Madrid had shown an interest in signing Kane and were informed by his camp last week that he would push for an exit, but they are unlikely to make a move for the England captain at this stage. Though Kane has plenty of admirers at the club, president Florentino Perez has made Kylian Mbappe - who has told PSG he will not extend his contract beyond 2024 and so could be sold this summer - Real Madrid's primary target. Los Blancos, like fellow suitors Manchester United, are of the belief that Kane will not be allowed to leave Tottenham and this is also contributing to the prioritising of their plans. If Spurs soften their stance, then Real Madrid's position could change."
Where Mason Mount ranks in Man Utd's most expensive transfers ever,"Jul 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/where-mason-mount-ranks-man-utd-most-expensive-transfers,"Some will say the Chelsea academy graduate could do with a new PR name - he bade farewell to Blues supporters via a monotonous, hostage-style video message that savvy viewers established had been recorded well in advance due to Mount's Gazza-inspired barnet which is no more - but the focus now is on what's ahead rather than what's been before. A message from Mason Mount to the Chelsea fans ðµâ¤ pic.twitter.com/UyjyA3AlcN The England international has joined Manchester United in a Â£60m deal after refusing to extend his Chelsea contract, having emerged as a star man in west London following his breakthrough 2019/20 campaign. And while he's a talent who divides opinion, there's no doubt that the Blues are worse off without him. However, Chelsea's loss is United's gain and the Red Devils have made Mount one of the most expensive signings in their history. Clubs were put on high alert after Mount rebuffed a new deal from the Blues and it became clear towards the end of the 2022/23 season the crafty midfielder would be leaving this summer despite Mauricio Pochettino's arrival. Arsenal and Liverpool both registered an interest but United quickly established themselves as the frontrunners. The Gunners and Reds chased alternative targets to leave the Red Devils with a free run at the Chelsea man. With his contract at Stamford Bridge expiring in 2024, United had plenty of leverage in negotiations but Chelsea certainly made them work for Mount's signature. The Blues demanded Â£65m; a fee United were hesitant to reach due to Financial Fair Play concerns. The Manchester club tabled offers worth Â£40m, Â£50m and Â£55m, all of which were rejected by Chelsea. It would take a fourth bid of Â£60m (initial Â£55m plus Â£5m in add-ons) to broker a deal with the Blues. With personal terms never an issue, a medical was quickly scheduled and Mount is now officially a Man Utd player. Rank Player Joined from Fee 1. Paul Pogba Juventus Â£89m 2. Antony Ajax Â£82m 3. Harry Maguire Leicester Â£80m 4. Romelu Lukaku Everton Â£75m 5. Jadon Sancho  Borussia Dortmund Â£73m 6. Casemiro Real Madrid Â£70m 7. Bruno Fernandes Sporting CP Â£67.6m 8. Mason Mount Chelsea Â£60m 9. Angel Di Maria Real Madrid Â£59.7m 10. Fred Shakhtar Donetsk Â£52m (fees include potential add-ons) United supporters will be pleading Mount fares better than the vast majority of the names listed on the above table. The Red Devils have a pretty woeful success rate when it comes to big-money signings. Discounting Mount, how many of United's top ten most expensive signings were or have been unmitigated successes? Bruno Fernandes is certainly one, while Casemiro enjoyed a stellar debut season. We'll say two then. The vast majority, including Paul Pogba and Harry Maguire, enjoyed up and down spells at Old Trafford, while Angel Di Maria was a distinct flop. Fred certainly hasn't shown enough to suggest he was worth over Â£50m despite racking up over 200 appearances for the club. Romelu Lukaku started brightly before fading, Jadon Sancho's career is yet to ignite and United massively overpaid the odds to sign Antony from Ajax. Mount, who has become United's eighth most expensive signing ever, will be hoping to follow in the footsteps of Bruno at Old Trafford, not Angel."

Andre Onana hopeful of Man Utd transfer despite Saudi Arabia interest,"Jul 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/andre-onana-hopeful-man-utd-transfer-despite-saudi-arabia-interest,"United have identified Onana as their top goalkeeping target with long-term number one David de Gea now a free agent upon the expiry of his contract last Friday. United are still set to speak to the Spaniard to make a clear decision on his future and whether he continues at Old Trafford, but Erik ten Hag has decided Onana is his ideal number one for the new campaign. Whether United can get the transfer over the line remains to be seen, given financial constraints and Ten Hag's ambition to strengthen in a number of positions. But there is optimism that a deal can be done. United are on the verge of committing a large chunk of their transfer budget to Chelsea for Mason Mount, who will imminently be announced as their first summer signing. Mount is to set United back an initial Â£55m, and Ten Hag also wants to sign a new centre forward in addition to a new goalkeeper as a priority. The Dutchman would also like to bringi in a second midfielder before the new season begins, with Fiorentina's Sofyan Amrabat and Southampton's Romeo Lavia of interest. However, that position is lower down the list as it stands and funds may need to be raised through player sales before one does arrive. United are ready to use up a large portion of their existing transfer budget on a goalkeeper and striker, with Onana and Atalanta's Rasmus Hojlund currently top of the agenda. Prices for both deals are currently being negotiated with Inter and Atalanta respectively, and the structure of will be key to each transfer being signed off. 90min reported earlier this week of interest in Hojlund and United are determined not to overpay for the 20-year-old Danish striker.

Ten Hag worked with the player at Ajax and he particularly caught the eye for his distribution in last month's Champions League final, which Inter narrowly lost to Manchester City. Ten Hag wants United's distribution to improve from the back - a problem seen time and again with De Gea in goal last season. Inter believe Onana is worth â¬60m (Â£51m) after his outstanding performances towards the back end of last season, and want to hold out for that fee but United - who value the 27-year-old at a maximum â¬50m (Â£43m) - believe they are in a strong position in negotiations. The Serie A side are in a tricky financial position themselves and are trying to bring Romelu Lukaku permanently back from Chelsea, but struggling to bring the money together to secure a deal. United have a number of options on what goalkeeper they pursue, are not yet formally parted with De Gea and also have Dean Henderson, who has returned for pre-season training, to fall back on. United are also monitoring other targets, such as Feyenoord's Justin Bijlow, who is the current Dutch number one. It's understood by 90min that the player and his representatives do not believe he is United's first choice target, and are treating the situation as such as it stands. Feyenoord don't want to sell in an ideal world after impressively winning the Eredivisie last season under Arne Slot, though would part ways with the 25-year-old at Â£25m if United were to formalise their interest. Slot himself is understood to know such a price is good value which can be reinvested. The player would be expected to push for the move should it materialise, but United's priorities are with Onana for the time being."

By that point, the club will have had more opportunity to clear the decks and make room for him as financial issues continue to impact football operations.

The whispy midfielder only properly broke into the first-team the following season, before later flourishing under the thousand-yard stare of Erik ten Hag. Long before Ten Hag took charge of United, links of a move for De Jong had emerged. Here is a look at how the rumours and whispers have grown over the years. De Jong's parents - who named their child after the band Frankie Goes to Hollywood - were not the only ones paying close attention to their son's first start for the national team. United had reportedly sent scouts to the Netherlands' 2-1 defeat against France in the UEFA Nation's League to check out the wriggling youngster. Tottenham had supposedly seen a Â£45m bid rebuffed the previous summer but Barcelona were rightly ranked as favourites. Intriguingly, the scout that recommended De Jong to United after that trip, Derek Langley, was 'removed' from the club after a frank discussion with chief executive Ed Woodward about the transfer targets that had been overlooked. In January 2019, De Jong agreed to his 'dream' move to Barcelona for â¬75m just three years after visiting Camp Nou as a spectator. Manchester City - rather than United - were Barcelona's closest rivals in the race for his signature. As De Jong embarked upon a patchy adaptation period in Catalonia, rumours of a move to United subsided. But they would be back. Barcelona were economically crippled by the coronavirus pandemic which initially suspended football before forcing all matches behind closed doors. With the largest wage bill in the sport, the lack of revenue was catastrophic. Rival clubs quickly smelled blood and began sniffing around Barcelona's saleable assets; chief among which was De Jong. In the winter of 2021, De Jong's father John claimed that 'the five top European clubs have all called'. It was implied that United were one of the interested suitors but De Jong Sr suggested that the 'bad weather there' could hamper the club's chances of snagging his son. As soon as a manager moves to a new club, they are immediately linked with all of the star players they just left. This is an easy and lazy rumour to spread. Inevitably, in the same month that the Dutchman was announced as Ralf Rangnick's permanent successor at Old Trafford, De Jong's name was straight back in the gossip columns. However, Ten Hag's business upon arrival at Old Trafford has tended to revolve around known variables. When United's bid for Ajax's Jurrien Timber was rebuffed, his teammate Lisandro Martinez made the move, before winger Antony followed the same path. De Jong hasn't been reunited with his old boss just yet. The rumour mill began to audibly whirr as the 2022 summer transfer window drew nearer. United were supposedly prepared to make De Jong the club's highest-paid player as they sought a replacement for the departing midfielder Paul Pogba. However, at the same time, reports emerged that De Jong was underwhelmed by United's approach. It appeared that the presence of Ten Hag did not make up for a lack of Champions League football and the player's ultimate desire to stay in Barcelona. De Jong may have been uncertain - the midfielder would go no further than politely accepting that he was 'flattered' by the interest - but Barcelona were more than happy to negotiate an exit for their expensive midfielder. If Barcelona had reluctantly elbowed Lionel Messi out of Camp Nou the year before due to their financial limitations, they had no qualms about accepting a hefty fee for De Jong. After an initial offer of â¬60m was rejected by the cash-strapped club, multiple sources reported that Barcelona had agreed to a sum in the region of â¬65m. However, De Jong was emphatically not on the same page. With talk of the fee rising as high as â¬80m, De Jong had to forcefully make his position clear. As the player explained in the following summer: ""The club was in a difficult situation. They were able to sell me for a big fee, and they wanted to do this, but I did not want to leave so I stayed."" One of the sticking points was the deferred wages Barcelona owed De Jong. The Dutchman was part of the squad which set aside their salary during the height of the pandemic but never entirely wrote off that money. As Barcelona reluctantly pay De Jong what he is owed, he will be the top earner in all of La Liga for the 2023/24 season. In mid-August, a self-imposed deadline reportedly passed which forced United to withdraw all agreements that had been made in their bid to sign De Jong. Barcelona had tried their best to make Catalonia as hostile as possible for the midfielder, with Xavi Hernandez purposefully deploying De Jong as an uncomfortable centre-back during pre-season. De Jong admitted there was a 'situation' with club president Joan Laporta but he eventually dug his heels deep enough. However, Ten Hag was not deterred. Another transfer window rolled around and more links between United and De Jong unsurprisingly followed. Despite repeatedly stressing his desire to remain in Spain in public, De Jong supposedly told Ten Hag in private that he was ""happy to join Barcelona"". Named as one of four players 'not for sale' by Barcelona president Laporta that month, De Jong duly stayed put. Gluttons for punishment, United still have De Jong sitting atop their list of transfer targets, 90min understands. Despite the repeated rejection, Ten Hag still 'adores' his former player. Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich are also interested, sniffing around the situation as Barcelona endure more financial issues. feed"
Thomas Muller admits he 'likes' Harry Kane,"Jul 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/thomas-muller-admits-he-likes-harry-kane,"The Bavarian giants have courted the striker for nearly a year now, with former manager Julian Nagelsmann first revealing his and the club's admiration of Kane in late July of 2022. 90min extensively reported throughout the 2022/23 season that Bayern were keeping tabs on Kane ahead of a potential summer transfer. Bayern had an opening bid knocked back by Spurs last week, while 90min understands Kane's camp have made it known to other European heavyweights like Real Madrid and PSG that he is looking to leave. However, Tottenham are confident that he will end the transfer window still at the club. Muller, who is only 34 games away from equalling Sepp Maier's all-time appearance record at Bayern with 700, was asked by BILD about the club's pursuit of Kane. ""I've actually told myself that as long as something is not done, it's not worth talking about,"" Muller said. When asked if he 'likes' Kane, Muller laughed and replied: ""I don't know anyone that doesn't like him!"" feed Bayern are on the hunt for a new striker after just about surviving the 2022/23 season without bringing in a replacement for Robert Lewandowski following his transfer to Barcelona. Die Roten needed a final-day Borussia Dortmund collapse to win their 11th-straight Bundesliga title, and fell disappointingly short in both the Champions League and DFB-Pokal. Their top scorer in the Bundesliga was winger Serge Gnabry with 14 goals, while Kane notched 30 in the Premier League for a struggling Spurs side."
Joan Laporta reveals Barcelona have rejected offers for eight players,"Jul 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/joan-laporta-barcelona-reject-offers-eight-players,"Barca's financial plight in recent years has been well-documented, with the club being forced to sell Lionel Messi after they could not register his contract, and then being unable to re-sign the Argentine legend this summer despite the player's desire to return to Camp Nou.  Club president Laporta even recently revealed that, due to being forced to defer some of Messi's wages during his time at the club, Barcelona will continue to pay the player until 2025. ""What is owed to him is the deferral of the salary bill that was agreed with the previous board and that produces pending payments that end in 2025,"" Laporta remarked. Despite the club's monetary issues, Barcelona remain keen on strengthening Xavi's squad with high-profile signings - Joshua Kimmich and Bernardo Silva among those to be on Barca's shortlist - and are expected to make moves before the transfer window closes. Barcelona also have no intention of parting ways with any of their key players, which is something Laporta referenced in an interview with La Vanguardia. Indeed, he named eight current stars that the club have turned down offers for, reaffirming the Catalan giants are not in the business of being a selling club. There are offers for [Andreas] Christensen, for Pedri, for Gavi, for [Ronald] AraÃºjo, for [Marc Andre] ter Stegen, for Ansu [Fati], for Raphinha, for [Alejandro] Balde. But we are not a selling club,"" Laporta said. feed â[Iâd tell Ansu] to continue. He has to earn Xaviâs trust and when he plays make a difference because he has the talent he can do it.â 90min understands that Fati has been a target for Premier League sides Wolves and West Ham United during the summer transfer window, although the player isn't keen on making a move to clubs who finished in the lower half of England's top flight last season.  In the higher reaches of the Premier League, interest has been rife for Raphinha and Gavi in particular, with the former being near the top of Arsenal's shortlist of potential right wing targets, and the latter previously being targeted by Manchester City and Liverpool.  Gavi's contract renewal was eventually registered by Barcelona in June, some nine months after he originally put pen to paper on a new deal. LISTEN NOW"
FIFA's stance on players at Ukrainian clubs - explained,"Jul 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/fifa-ukrainian-clubs-explained,"What the former Ajax and Netherlands manager actually said was closer to: ""Football is something like war. Whoever behaves too properly is lost."" In the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, FIFA has been tasked with setting the guidelines for proper behaviour in the relatively inconsequential realm of football amid the conflict. However, Ukrainian clubs - spearheaded by reigning champions Shakhtar Donetsk - have felt persecuted by FIFA's regulations. Shakhtar even took world football's governing body to court in search of ""reparations"". With the summer transfer window in full swing, here's everything you need to know about FIFA's stance on players and managers at Ukrainian clubs and how it could affect the market. In an uncharacteristic demonstration of speed, FIFA released a set of ""temporary rulesaddressing the exceptional situation deriving from the war in Ukraine"" within a fortnight of Russian troops entering Kharkiv in 2022. Under the new measures, foreign players and coaches could unilaterally suspend their contracts with clubs from the football federations of Ukraine or Russia for the rest of the 2021/22 season. FIFA outlined the aim of this ruling was ""to protect foreign players and coaches who have left the territory of Ukraine or Russia due to the conflict and who do not wish to currently return in view of the circumstances"". After stretching the measures through the 2022/23 campaign, FIFA revealed that the ruling would be extended again on Monday 22 May 2023. Much to the disgust of clubs from Ukraine and Russia, foreign players and coaches can suspend their contracts in both countries until 30 June 2024 - as long as they let the club know, in writing, by 1 July 2023, per Annexe 7 of FIFA's Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players (RSTP). However, players and coaches can only suspend their contract if they did not extend their existing deal after the ruling was first put in place on 7 March 2022. As FIFA explained in a statement released alongside the updated rules: ""Foreign players and coaches who have, despite the war in Ukraine, decided to arrive in, return to, or not leave the territory of Ukraine or Russia, cannot rely on the revised Annexe 7 to the RSTP to suspend an ongoing contract."" According to Annexe 7, players who have had their contracts extended ""would not be able, during the period of suspension, to be subject to a transfer (whether permanent or on loan) against payment"" - i.e. a player who has suspended their contract with a Ukrainian club cannot be transferred for a fee during their suspension. That particular wrinkle is why so many foreign players have either departed on free transfers or moved on an initial loan deal. FC Shakhtar CEO Serhii Palkin met with Katarina Pijetlovic, General Secretary of the Union of European Clubs, in Kyiv.#Shakhtar #Ukraine pic.twitter.com/PuXvBNvGS7 Shakhtar Donetsk's CEO Sergei Palkin has launched a public assault on FIFA's stance since the amendments were released.  With a prolific youth system and revered Brazilian scouting network, Shakhtar have routinely commanded large sums from player sales in the transfer market, generating millions of euros from the likes of Fernandinho, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Fred over the years. The reigning Ukrainian champions took FIFA to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2022 demanding at least â¬40m in reparations of transfer fees they believe they would have earned had it not been for FIFA's ruling. CAS dismissed the case, judging that the regulations ""were not grossly disproportionate"" but Shakhtar filed a complaint before the European Union Commission in March. In the wake of yet another extension, Palkin claimed that Shakhtar are willing to legally challenge any team trying to extract their assets for free. ""I would like to send a message to those clubs who are trying to sign our players without paying a transfer fee,"" Palkin told ESPN. ""Shakhtar will file claims for unjust enrichment against players or clubs who have enriched themselves and benefitted by obtaining a financial advantage. ""We believe these clubs who enrich themselves at Shakhtar's expense will be obliged to pay restitutions. Those clubs should understand what they do when they decide to sign our players."" Tottenham have agreed terms with the forward but he is still under contract at Shakhtar until the end of the calendar year. As Solomon is a foreign player, has not extended his deal with the club and has not returned to the war zone, Annexe 7 should allow him to unilaterally suspend his Shakhtar contract as long as he told the club by 1 July 2023. However, Palkin warned: ""If you go to Tottenham, we will deal with Tottenham in court in this case."" feed"

Transfer notebook: Gerrard wants Tavernier in Saudi Arabia; Leeds set to lose Aaronson,"Jul 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/transfer-notebook-gerrard-tavernier-saudi-arabia-leeds-aaronson,"Gerrard was appointed as the Saudi side's new manager on Monday, returning to the dugout less than nine months after being sacked as Aston Villa manager. He previously enjoyed a successful three-year spell in charge of Rangers, leading the club to the Scottish Premiership title in 2020/21, and one of his key assets during that success was Tavernier. 31-year-old Tavernier has played over 400 games for Rangers in all competitions, but could be offered the chance to reunite with Gerrard as he looks to add some high-profile European experience to his squad. Philippe Coutinho and Jordan Henderson are two established former teammates of Gerrard who are being targeted, while there's also interest in luring Gini Wijnaldum away from Paris Saint-Germain on a permanent basis. The 20-year-old has proven his talent during an 18-month loan spell with Bolton Wanderers, helping the club reach last season's League One play-offs before sharing the club's Young Player of the Year award with Conor Bradley. A permanent transfer worth Â£19m has now been agreed with Manchester City, comprising of Â£14m in guaranteed money plus Â£5m in performance related add-ons, and Trafford will compete with another former City alumni, Arijanet Muric, for a starting berth. The Whites were relegated last season after cycling through Jesse Marsch, Javi Gracia and Sam Allardyce, the latter of whom was unable to keep the club afloat after coming in for the final few games of 2022/23. Milan rewarded Rafael Leao with a new contract recently but are keen to strengthen their forward options after qualifying once more for the Champions League. The 19-year-old has risen to prominence after a superb debut season in AZ's first team, with his ability on show in the club's Europa Conference League semi-final tie with West Ham. The Hammers also hold an interest in Kerkez, along with a number of other clubs, but Bournemouth are ready to open talks in a bid to get a deal over the line. The Cherries hope to make up to half a dozen new signings, providing new manager Andoni Iraola with some fresh firepower for the new season. The 30-year-old scored 13 La Liga goals for Atletico Madrid last season after spending two years on loan in Italy, and took over as captain of Spain's national team in March. A host of European superstars have already taken up the riches on offer in the Middle East, though a number of Italian clubs are also interested in signing Morata this summer - leaving plenty of talking to be done before any deal is agreed. feed"
Steven Gerrard keen to bring Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho to Saudi Arabia,"Jul 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/steven-gerrard-jordan-henderson-philippe-coutinho-saudi-arabia,"Al Ettifaq confirmed the appointment of Gerrard on Monday after the former Rangers and Aston Villa boss originally rejected the club's proposal at the end of June. 90min understands that Gerrard was hoping to secure jobs with either Leicester City or Leeds United but agreed to join the Saudi Pro League club when it became apparent that he would not land either role in England. Gerrard has been promised 'huge' funds in order to rebuild an Al Ettifaq side which finished seventh last season - 30 points off Asian Champions League qualification and just nine points clear of the relegation zone - and the legendary midfielder has requested the club make offers for two of his former Liverpool teammates. Sources have confirmed to 90min that both current Liverpool captain Henderson and Aston Villa star Coutinho are on Gerrard's radar this summer. Henderson currently has two years left on his current contract at Anfield, having signed a four-year deal back in 2021. Despite his advancing years, the 33-year-old has remained a valuable squad player for Jurgen Klopp, making 41 appearances in all competitions last season.  The midfielder played alongside Gerrard during the first four years of his now 12-year career at Liverpool, winning the League Cup together in the 2011/12 season. feed 90min understands that despite Gerrard's eagerness to make a move for Henderson, it will be extremely difficult to convince him to make the move to Saudi Arabia this summer. Although a move for Henderson may not be possible, sources have confirmed that one for Coutinho is. The club believe that the Brazil international is interested in making the move to Al Ettifaq in order to link up with his former teammate and manager. Gerrard and Coutinho spent three seasons together in Liverpool's midfield, striking up a real partnership as the creative hub of the Reds' team at the time. Since then, Gerrard has also worked with Coutinho in a coaching capacity, signing the Brazilian during his short stint as Aston Villa manager. Coutinho has struggled for game time at Villa Park since Gerrard was sacked in October 2022, making just seven starts in the Premier League during the 2022/23 campaign, and his lack of minutes under Unai Emery could be a key factor in whether or not he leaves this summer. Another former Liverpool player, Georginio Wijnaldum, is also of interest following the conclusion of his loan spell at Roma. The Dutchman spent five years at Anfield, playing alongside Henderson and Coutinho, and could be open to a permanent departure from Paris Saint-Germain."

Wolves recorded losses of more than Â£40m in their most recent set of accounts for 2021/22, with Premier League rules outlawing losses in excess of Â£105m over a three-year period. The club was profitable to the tune of Â£21m in 2020/21, but had posted sizeable losses over Â£36m for 2019/20. The 2022/23 figures are not publicly available, but more big losses in those accounts would mean counting the pennies carefully across the coming season to avoid exceeding the limit."
Newcastle register interest in Chelsea's Conor Gallagher & Trevoh Chalobah,"Jul 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/newcastle-register-interest-chelsea-conor-gallagher-trevoh-chalobah,"The Magpies are on the look out for squad depth as they prepare to return to the Champions League and are eyeing players with European experience, which has led them in Chelsea's direction. Chelsea have already agreed to over Â£200m worth of sales. But they are still looking to trim their squad further and sources have confirmed to 90min that Newcastle are keeping tabs on a number of players who could potentially be available. One of those on Newcastle's radar is midfielder Gallagher. The 23-year-old was a target back in January and remains high on the Magpies' wish list, with a loan their preferred move at this point. However, with so much interest in Gallagher from across Europe, there is an awareness that Chelsea are unlikely to agree to a temporary move and so Newcastle would be prepared to consider signing the midfielder permanently. Chelsea have not yet made a final decision on Gallagher's future, with club officials keen to give new manager Mauricio Pochettino the chance to work with the England international first. feed Chalobah has also emerged as a potential target for Newcastle, who are looking for a new right-sided centre-back and have registered an interest in the 23-year-old. Like Gallagher, there is plenty of interest in Chalobah. In the Premier League, the defender is on the radars of both Crystal Palace and West Ham, while Serie A giants Inter have also voiced an interest in Chalobah during the ongoing discussions between the two clubs over Romelu Lukaku's future. 90min understands that Chelsea are keen to keep Chalobah, who signed a new six-year contract in November. The academy graduate made 33 appearances in all competitions across 2022/23, providing reliable cover at both centre-back and right-back, although he started fewer than half of Chelsea's Premier League games and is believed to be looking for a greater role next season. With Thiago Silva turning 39 in September, there is also an awareness that the veteran Brazilian may be in his final year at Chelsea and selling Chalobah could leave the Blues short in the future."
Barcelona confident of agreeing defender sale to Tottenham,"Jul 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-confident-defender-sale-tottenham,"Lenglet joined Spurs on loan for last season and made 35 appearances in all competitions, but Spurs declined to trigger their option to buy the defender permanently. Now officially back at Barcelona, Lenglet is up for sale once again and Laporta believes the Frenchman will find his way back to Spurs. ""I think weâll reach an agreement with Tottenham for Lenglet,"" Laporta revealed to La Vanguardia. ""This almost never goes fast. It depends on the other party.â feed Lenglet still has three years remaining on his Barcelona contract, having inked a six-year deal back in 2020 when he was emerging as one of the Blaugrana's top defenders. After falling down the pecking order, Lenglet found his way to Tottenham last season and played a major role for the Premier League side, although a mixed run of form left fans divided on whether he should be signed permanently. Spurs are known to be keen to bolster at centre-back this summer and have explored deals for a handful of targets, most recently making contact with Wolfsburg over Dutchman Micky van de Ven. Another leading Bundesliga centre-back, Edmond Tapsoba of Bayer Leverkusen, is known to be on Spurs' radar - both targets operate on the left-side of a traditional centre-back pairing like Lenglet."

Tonali has inked an initial five-year contract at St James' Park and becomes the second-most expensive signing in Newcastle history, behind only striker Alexander Isak. ""First of all, I want to thank Newcastle United because they are giving me a huge opportunity for my career,"" Tonali said.

Man Utd continue talks with Atalanta over Rasmus Hojlund transfer,"Jul 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-two-rasmus-hojlund-offers-rejected-atalanta,"Manager Erik ten Hag has identified a new centre forward among his top priorities, with Tottenham's Harry Kane and Napoli's Victor Osimhen initially targeted. United were priced out of signing both players but have now turned their attention to Hojlund, who has also been on their radar for some time. Still only 20, Hojlund only joined Atalanta last August from Austrian outfit Sturm Graz. He hit nine goals in his debut Serie A season and has also made his senior international debut for Denmark over the last year, scoring five times in six caps to date. United's dream scenario for the summer was to add an experienced first choice striker as well as a younger prospect of Hojlund's ilk to fix the position for the long-term. But budgetary restrictions are making matters difficult for them in negotiations. The club's ownership situation has still not been resolved by the Glazer family, despite the process lasting eight months and counting. They also have a decision to make on the future of Mason Greenwood. feed Mason Mount is set to join United in the coming days after a deal worth Â£55m plus Â£5m in add-ons was struck with Chelsea, and the club are now pressing ahead with their next target.  Sources close to Atalanta indicate the Serie A outfit are asking for â¬75m-â¬80m (Â£64m-Â£69m) to consider selling at this stage. Previous reported demands of â¬100m were not deemed serious by United. 90min understands United are not prepared to be held to ransom and are willing to go to â¬60m (Â£51.5m) but not much further to sign the player before the new season. Hojlund's camp believe United's valuation is fair and the player wants to move to Old Trafford. Hojlund has previously admitted he is a United fan, saying earlier this year: ""I will not hide the fact that I am a huge Man Utd fan. So, personally, [playing for them] would be one of the biggest things for me."" Juventus and Napoli are also interested in signing Hojlund. As well as the deal for Mount, United are looking to address their goalkeeping situation this summer having seen David de Gea's contract expire last Friday. The Spaniard is still considering an offer to extend his stay, but there are doubts over his status as long-term number one. United have been interested in Inter's Andre Onana to replace him, while Feyenoord's Justin Bijlow has also been considered."
Chelsea receive Lyon & AC Milan offers for Christian Pulisic,"Jul 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-receive-lyon-ac-milan-offers-christian-pulisic,"Pulisic has entered the final year of his contract at Stamford Bridge and is one of a number of players who are allowed to leave the club this summer. Chelsea have already raised over Â£200m through sales this window and the Blues hope to take that figure closer to Â£300m by the end of it. There has been interest in Pulisic from across Europe. Teams in Germany, Spain and Turkey have all voiced an interest in the 24-year-old, but sources have confirmed to 90min that it is Milan and Lyon who have made the first formal moves. The two clubs are both keen to sign Pulisic on a permanent deal this summer and are now in talks with Chelsea, who are braced for a significant loss on the Â£58m they paid to sign the American from Borussia Dortmund in 2019. Interest from Milan has been more prominent in recent weeks and the Serie A side are understood to believe Pulisic would prioritise a move to San Siro this summer. feed For Milan, Pulisic is particularly valuable as his Croatian passport means he would not need to take up one of their limited non-EU player spots in their squad. Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who joined from Chelsea last week, has taken up their last available place. Pulisic has spoken openly this summer about his desire for a fresh start, recently confessing to ESPN that he is looking to rediscover his happiness on a football pitch. ""I need to figure out whatâs going to be best for my future and be somewhere where I can go and play and be trusted and feel good in what Iâm doing,"" he admitted. ""I want to find that joy at a club level again, for sure."" Since his expensive move from Dortmund, Pulisic has struggled with both injuries and form. He has managed 145 appearances for Chelsea, racking up 26 goals and 21 assists, and now appears set for a fresh start elsewhere."

Interest from Pep Guardiola's side dates back to April. Leipzig have already lost key first team stars like Christopher Nkunku, Konrad Laimer and Dominik Szoboszlai this summer. The departure of Gvardiol, who started 24 league games as his side came third behind champions Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund, would be another hefty blow to the spine of last season's team. ""Gvardiol and his agents gave us their desire to move to Manchester City. We are in talks with City,"" Eberl told LVZ. feed ""Yes, for â¬100m plus bonuses, Gvardiol will end up in Pep's strong hands. The value of the deal would make Gvardiol the most expensiveÂ defender in history. But it might take a few more days."" That transfer fee would eclipse the Â£80m forked out by local rivals Manchester United to Leicester for Harry Maguire back in 2019. Gvardiol had previously been wanted by Chelsea last year but no agreement was ever reached before he signed a new contract with Leipzig. His arrival would add to Guardiola's strength in central defence. Consistent roles were found for Ruben Dias, Nathan Ake, Manuel Akanji and John Stones throughout the successful 2022/23 campaign, while Aymeric Laporte often warmed the bench or featured in lower stakes outings. City confirmed the arrival of Croatia international midfielder Mateo Kovacic before club captain Ilkay Gundogan's free transfer to Barcelona upon the expiry of his contract."

Annex 7 of the Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players under FIFA law allows players under contract with Ukrainian teams to suspend their deals and move elsewhere. Solomon will hope to sign for free in north London now, but Shakhtar chief executive Sergei Palkin has previously confirmed his club will take potential suitors to court over the transfer. He told ESPN: ""Finally, where he will go, I don't know. In any case, if you go to Tottenham, we will deal with Tottenham in court in this case. Everything comes to a simple situation: it sounds like unjust enrichment. ""Can you imagine, we pay big money for this player and finally Tottenham receives him for free? It is not fair in respect of our club. We will definitely go to court and we will fight for ourselves. feed ""I would like to send a message to those clubs who are trying to sign our players without paying a transfer fee: Shakhtar will file claims for unjust enrichment against players or clubs who have enriched themselves and benefitted by obtaining a financial advantage. ""We believe these clubs who enrich themselves at Shakhtar's expense will be obliged to pay restitutions. Those clubs should understand what they do when they decide to sign our players."" Solomon suffered a long-term knee injury at the start of the 2022/23 season and didn't make another competitive appearance for the Cottages until January. He then scored in five straight games from the start of February to early March in clashes against Nottingham Forest, Brighton, Wolves, Leeds and Brentford. Solomon has also played 35 times for Israel, scoring seven goals."

Liverpool confirm Dominik Szoboszlai shirt number,"Jul 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-confirm-dominik-szoboszlai-shirt-number,"The Reds have made Szoboszlai their second signing of the summer after triggering the release clause in his contract. With personal terms already agreed and the Hungarian keen to make the switch to Anfield, he put pen to paper on his new contract in England. The 22-year-old will give Jurgen Klopp several options, capable of operating on either flank or as a 'number 10'. But the digit he will wear on his back is one made famous by Steven Gerrard. Ironically, he shares some other shirt number history with Gerrard, having worn 17 at Leipzig - the ex-Liverpool captain had that jersey at Anfield for four years from 2000. Liverpool fans will hope Szoboszlai will do the iconic number eight, worn by Gerrard for 11 seasons from 2004 until 2015, more proud than previous wearer Naby Keita. The Guinea international also arrived at Anfield from RB Leipzig in a big money transfer, only to see his five years at the club defined by frustrating injuries that limited his opportunities to play. Other Liverpool number eights in the Premier League era include Emile Heskey, Stan Collymore, Oyvind Leonhardsen and Jamie Redknapp. feed Szoboszlai has already highlighted his eagerness to play at Anfield following a previous visit as an away player with former club Red Bull Salzburg in 2019, a game in which Erling Haaland, Takumi Minamino and Hwang Hee-chan all scored for the Austrian club in a 4-3 defeat. ""This time made me feel bad because we lost 4-3! But of course, I've said it before, I've almost never been nervous before the game, I think this was the first time in my life,"" Szoboszlai told club media.

Jurgen Klopp highlights 'proper positives' in Dominik Szoboszlai,"Jul 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jurgen-klopp-highlights-proper-positives-dominik-szoboszlai,"The Reds triggered Szoboszlai's â¬70m release clause on Friday and wasted little time getting the deal wrapped up, finalising the Hungary international's arrival at Anfield just two days later. Szoboszlai becomes Liverpool's third most expensive signing of all time, behind only Darwin Nunez and Virgil van Dijk, and Klopp is excited to get to work with such a high-profile talent. ""The first thing for me to say is welcome to Liverpool, Dominik,"" Klopp told club media. ""I know how excited he is to be here with us, so it is important that he understands that we are all just as excited to have him. ""We already have a little knowledge of Dominik as an opponent because we had a couple of really tough games against Red Bull Salzburg when he was a player there and I think everyone who saw those fixtures will have realised that even at that stage he was a really interesting prospect. ""I'm pretty sure he was still a teenager at that time and since then he has made some big strides â moving to Leipzig, doing really, really well in the Bundesliga, playing for the Hungary national team and then becoming captain of his national team at an incredibly young age. feed ""These are proper positives and this is even before we even think about his qualities as a footballer. I will not say too much about them at this stage except they are definitely the kind which will hopefully bring a lot of enjoyment and also help us to get results. ""There is no pressure, though. Dominik is still a very young player. He has so much development ahead of him and this means it makes sense for us all to be patient and to give him the time and space to allow his talent to come through within our team.

I know the fans are as excited as we are but I am also aware, because I have seen it many times already, that they will be a massive help to us in terms of creating the conditions that will allow Dominik to thrive. ""From the clubs he has been at, the leagues he has played in and the family he is part of, it is very clear that he has already had an outstanding football education, so our responsibility now is to continue this education with him as part of the Liverpool family. ""Everything about this is good news and I am very grateful to everyone at the club who has contributed to making it happen. This is a signing for our present and also for our future and the work that has gone into it could not be more appreciated."""

Jurrien Timber absent from Ajax training as Arsenal transfer nears,"Jul 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jurrien-timber-absent-ajax-training-arsenal-transfer-nears,"The Gunners reached an agreement with the Dutch giants last week over an initial Â£36m (â¬42m) fee topped up by a further Â£4m (â¬5m) in add-ons. Timber had been working individually at Ajaxâs training facility when he returned from holiday towards the end of last month. But Dutch outlet AD has reported that he wasnât present on Saturday when Steijn hosted his first group session of pre-season on the outdoor pitches. The same report further adds that Steijn and Ajax donât expect to see Timber back, given that his transfer to Arsenal is so close. feed 90min reported last week that personal terms between Timber and the Gunners are already agreed, with formal completion considered to be imminent â Arsenal are also in the final stages of wrapping up a British record Â£105m transfer for Declan Rice, having already announced Kai Havertz. The versatile Timber, who is expected to become the new starting right-back and mirror the inverted style of Oleksandr Zincehnko on the opposite flank, will boost an Arsenal defence that struggled in the final two months of last seasonâs Premier League title race and contributed to their slip-up in the title race. Leaking 11 goals in the space of four win-less gams in April blew the door wide open for Manchester City, who were responsible for scoring four of those, to surge through. Arsenal will also need better strength in depth when it comes to the Champions League, competing in European footballâs elite tournament for the first time in six years."
Girona left angered by Barcelona's Oriol Romeu approach,"Jul 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/girona-angered-barcelona-oriol-romeu-approach,"Barcelona are on the hunt for a new defensive midfielder this summer following the departure of Sergio Busquets and are set to miss out on key target Marcelo Brozovic, who is close to swapping Inter for Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia. Reports in Spain have named 31-year-old Romeu, a La Masia graduate, as a possible target for Xavi and have even gone as far as to claim the Barcelona boss has personally reached out to Romeu about a summer return to Camp Nou. This contact from Xavi has upset those in charge at Girona, who released a short statement to SPORT urging the Barcelona boss to play by the rules. ""We know that Xavi has called our player and Oriol Romeu is not free, he has a contract with Girona until 2025, so we say that this cannot be done,"" the statement read. feed Romeu's contract with Girona is understood to contain a release clause of under â¬10m which, though affordable, could still be problematic for a Barcelona side keen to limit their spending while they get their finances back under control. The 31-year-old joined Barcelona's academy in 2004 and made two appearances for the first team during the 2010/11 campaign, before being snapped up by Chelsea in 2011. Various loans and a permanent switch to Southampton followed, with Romeu landing back in Spain with Girona last summer. The veteran was one of the top performers in Michel's side, attracting plenty of praise for playing some sensational football as Girona finished tenth in La Liga in their first season back in the top flight. Romeu has played his way on to Barcelona's radar and represents a cheaper alternative to Real Sociedad starlet Martin Zubimendi, whose release clause sits at â¬60m."

Pedro Porro responds to Harry Kane links to Real Madrid,"Jul 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/pedro-porro-responds-harry-kane-links-real-madrid,"90min understands that Kane's representatives are beginning plans to push for a summer exit, with Bayern Munich, PSG and Real Madrid interested in the striker. Bayern have already seen one bid rejected by Spurs, who have denied that they have even received an offer but would reject any that came in. Kane has one year left to run on his contract. Porro, who joined Tottenham at the back-end of the January transfer window, has struck up a great on-pitch relationship with Kane, with each of the Spaniard's three Premier League assists so far coming for the England captain. In an interview with AS, Porro said of Kane: ""He is a leader, captain and reference. He has been offering great performance for many years, he has charisma and here he is an idol for the fans."" feed When asked if Kane was one of the top three forwards in world football, Porro replied: ""Of course. I wouldn't doubt it for a second. Very few forwards offer the work and defensive commitment that Harry gives [a lot], apart from his enormous quality and his scoring. He is a 'crack'. ""I have been in the team for a short time but long enough to realise how close he is with his teammates. From what I have spoken with him and what I have seen, I can say that he is also very great off the pitch."" Porro was then specifically asked if Kane had the quality to play for Real Madrid, answering: ""Great players like him adapt well to any situation. He has shown that he is a phenomenon. Besides, he already has a lot of experience. There's a reason he's the [vice] captain of Tottenham and the England team. A footballer always wants to have teammates like him by his side."""
Midfielders Newcastle should target instead of James Maddison,"Jul 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/midfielders-newcastle-should-target-instead-of-james-maddison,"Then-manager Brendan Rodgers could barely contain a snigger as he said: ""It's not for me to put valuations on the players, it's not my side, but that might just cover three-quarters of his left leg, that price."" A year on, with Rodgers out of the door and the Foxes in the Championship, Maddison was sold for Â£40m. However, it was Tottenham that nabbed the English playmaker rather than Newcastle. With the club's first season of Champions League football in two decades looming, Newcastle have to bolster a squad that finished fourth last term despite a wobble in Spring. Here are some of the alternative midfielders Newcastle could target after Maddison's snub. feed If the sudden craze around Arda Guler this summer has caught you by surprise, don't feel too bad - the toast of the transfer rumour mill has only made 20 club starts in his entire senior career. Nevertheless, in the limited game time he has been afforded for Fenerbahce, the wriggly left-footer (his father trained him to favour his left side as soon as he could walk) has emerged as one of Europe's brightest talents. Barcelona are hopeful of securing a deal for the 'Turkish Messi' with Real Madrid also interested. A rumoured release clause of Â£15m ensures that money is no object but Newcastle could offer Guler first-team football straight away, slotting into Howe's three-man midfield where Maddison would have played or as an alternative for Miguel Almiron on the right. Across Spain's top flight, Gabri Veiga was the only midfielder to hit double digits for non-penalty goals. If Newcastle are to push on from last season's fourth-place finish, they will need to sharpen their cutting edge; five clubs, including Maddison's new team Tottenham, outscored the Magpies last term. While fans should not expect Veiga to necessarily replicate his scoring feats (the midfielder's 11 goals came from an xG of 6.1) he will offer another presence in the attacking third. Newcastle face fierce competition from Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City for the signature of a hot prospect that has a â¬40m release clause. As a strong advocate against forcing young kids into routines of professional footballers from a young age, Teun Koopmeiners may not look too kindly at the prodigious acceleration of Guler and Veiga. At 25, the Atalanta midfielder is an option that offers an extra layer of maturity and security. Koopmeiners' former national team manager Louis van Gaal succinctly outlined his strengths: ""overview, insight and a good kicking technique."" A regular Liverpool target, Koopmeiners can play in any midfield role and has thrived in the exhaustive pressing system Gian PIero Gasperini employs at Atalanta. This grounding could help Koopmeiner limit the adaptation process which Eddie Howe's signings have been forced to undergo. While he improves his ability to halt opposition surges, Khepren Thuram launches far more of his own as he regularly embarks upon barrelling runs right through the middle of the pitch. The 6'3 midfielder, whose father Lilian won the 1998 World Cup and his brother Marcus played in last year's final, is comfortable across a range of roles. At his best under Didier Digard at Nice, Thuram thrived in a side that had space to counter-attack into. Howe's set-up on Tyneside would suit him; only Manchester United launched more forward thrusts in transition than Newcastle last season. Newcastle's failure to capture Maddison could prove to be a blessing in disguise. With the impending arrival of Sandro Tonali, Newcastle have already snagged an extra option as a number eight in Howe's 4-3-3. However, if the Magpies could lure Ibrahim Sangare away from PSV Eindhoven this summer, they would be able to unshackle Bruno Guimaraes from his defensive berth at the base of midfield. The towering Ivory Coast international has spent three years dominating the Eredivisie and signed a new contract with PSV last year. However, Sangare was reportedly unimpressed with the unexpected resignation of manager Ruud van Nistelrooy in May and could join him in the departure lounge if Newcastle make a compelling offer."
Levi Colwill eyeing Mauricio Pochettino talks before Chelsea contract decision,"Jul 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/levi-colwill-mauricio-pochettino-talks-chelsea-contract-decision,"The 20-year-old enjoyed an excellent loan spell with Brighton last season and has been the subject of enquiries from both Liverpool and Manchester City this summer, while the Seagulls are keen to bring Colwill back on a permanent basis. Chelsea, however, are adamant that Colwill will not be sold this summer. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Blues officials see the defender as an integral part of the squad and they are not prepared to even entertain the idea of losing Colwill. Liverpool returned with another enquiry about his availability in recent weeks but were swiftly knocked back. The 20-year-old remains under contract until 2025, with an additional 12-month extension clause to be triggered after a certain number of senior appearances, and so Chelsea are incredibly relaxed about the situation. Club officials are prepared to open talks over a new deal but Colwill wants certain assurances before making a decision. For Colwill, the biggest priority is regular minutes next season. The centre-back will speak to Pochettino upon his return to Cobham in search of guarantees over his role, and he is expected to be assured of his status as a key player. feed Colwill was invited to train with the senior England squad last month and admitted he will only get the chance to stay there permanently with regular minutes at club level. ""Going up and training with [England] is one thing, but I've got to keep up my performances next season. I need to play. I need to do well,"" Colwill confessed. ""There are so many things that come into you going back there. I don't think it's a case of, 'I'm close now, I might go up on the next camp'. I've got to keep playing, and playing well. That will be a big thing for me next season."" Chelsea, like the vast majority of fans, hold Colwill in very high regard but the defender himself believes the best is yet to come. ""I'm getting loads of praise but I'm still making mistakes that not everyone sees because I'm getting so much praise,"" he explained. ""I know I can be much better and have so much more to come."""

How can Arsenal afford extravagant summer spend?,"Jul 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/how-can-arsenal-afford-extravagant-summer-spend,"Mikel Arteta has adhered to many of the lessons he learned from Wenger over the years but the idea of holding back in the transfer market - which was an idealised view of Arsenal's approach in Wenger's latter years anyway - has not been one of them. Before the end of June, Arsenal had already agreed to transfers worth more than the rest of the division's outlay combined. While Liverpool have had to count the pennies in recent windows and even Todd Boehly's free-spending Chelsea have focused on outgoings before adding to their pile of lucrative assets, how have Arsenal been able to carry on buying superstars? Player Agreed fee Signed from Declan Rice Â£105m West Ham Kai Havertz Â£65m Chelsea Jurrien Timber Â£40.5m Ajax Kai Havertz was the first name officially through the door at Arsenal this summer. The club hijacked Kepa Arrizabalaga's wedding to shoot the announcement video which revealed a move from Chelsea worth up to Â£65m. After two rejected bids, Arsenal have belatedly agreed to West Ham's valuation of Declan Rice for a British record fee of Â£105m. The last time Arsenal broke the British transfer record, Dennis Bergkamp arrived in north London for just Â£7.5m. On top of the new arrivals, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale and Bukayo Saka have all penned hefty contract extensions this calendar year. William Saliba has agreed to a new four-year deal in principle as well. Wenger was originally one of the strongest advocates for Financial Fair Play (FFP) but became disillusioned by the idea when he deemed that the new rules had ""not been respected"" back in 2017. As recently as this year, both Manchester City and Everton have been accused of breaching the updated stipulations. Whether Wenger holds with them or not, the latest Premier League regulations state that no club is permitted to lose more than Â£105m across three consecutive seasons.  Last term's second-place finish may have stung but it did ensure that Arsenal qualified for the Champions League for the first time in six years. UEFA, naturally, have their own set of economic guidelines; namely, clubs are limited to spending no more than 90% of their revenue on staff wages and agent fees. This proportion is set to shrink each year, promoting more sustainable models across Europe's elite. feed Arsenal posted a loss of Â£107.3m at the end of the 2020/21 season and were in a deficit of Â£45.5m last term. Theoretically, the Gunners should have to make a profit of Â£47.8m this year to fall in line with the regulations but it isn't so straightforward - where's the fun in that? The 2020/21 season still falls under the bracket of a COVID-impacted campaign (only three of Arsenal's home matches had any fans in attendance) and all losses caused by the pandemic are overlooked by the Premier League's bean counters. Furthermore, Arsenal can write off any costs relating to infrastructure, the academy or the women's team. Not only is Arsenal's financial position far rosier than the top line numbers suggest, but the latest available set of accounts do not take into consideration the windfall set to flood the club's coffers. Should this be Arsenal's midfield next season? ðª pic.twitter.com/d5xbnn53r7 On top of the increased rewards earned by jumping from fifth to second in the Premier League last season, Arsenal are now entitled to a share of the Champions League spoils. The Gunners bowed out in the Europa League round of 16 to Sporting CP in March, raking in around Â£30m. The club are expected to make just as much - if not considerably more - just by qualifying for Europe's premier competition, with the bonuses from sponsors and baseline competition prize money guaranteed. Arsenal may have been extravagant with transfer fees in recent windows, but that flair has not extended to the wage bill. The Gunners spend less than half as much as Manchester City on player salaries each season. According to Capology, Arsenal only had the sixth highest wage bill in the division last term, comparable to Aston Villa and less than London rivals Chelsea and Tottenham - both of which failed to qualify for European competition.  This pay-check parsimony ensures that Arsenal are flying well below UEFA's revenue/wages threshold."

The 27-year-old even managed ten caps for England between 2017 and 2020 but lost his place in the international setup as he fell out of favour at club level. Winks started just nine Premier League games in the 2021/22 campaign and would join Serie A side Sampdoria on loan last summer. An ankle injury delayed his start in Italy but Winks became a core part of the Italian side's midfield.

The Eagles are keen to retain Zaha, who has previously stressed his desire to play Champions League football. He does have the opportunity to play in Europe's top competition next season. Marseille and Lazio, of Ligue 1 and Serie A respectively, have both lodged offers to Zaha and can offer the European football he craves. feed However, Zaha has also been offered the chance to collect an enormous wage in Saudi Arabia. Thus far, Zaha has dismissed the advances from the Middle East but, like the contract from Palace, the offer has not yet been formally rejected or withdrawn and remains an option for the 30-year-old forward. There has previously been interest in Zaha from a number of the sides towards the top of the Premier League - Chelsea and Arsenal are known to have tracked the Ivorian in the past - but none have come forward with offers this summer. Zaha's decision to allow his Palace contract to expire will have a knock-on effect on former employers Manchester United, who negotiated a 25% sell-on clause when they sold the winger back in 2015."

Inter send warning to Chelsea over Romelu Lukaku asking price,"Jul 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/inter-send-warning-chelsea-romelu-lukaku-asking-price,"Lukaku has just returned to Chelsea after his loan with Inter expired and all three parties are looking to strike an agreement which will see the Belgian remain with the Nerazzurri next year and beyond.

""It is clear that they cannot imagine putting him on the market and receiving significant offers. feed ""It is no coincidence that the possible sale to Saudi Arabia was around â¬50M. That can be a target that is very far from the â¬115M we asked for, and got, to sell him two years ago."" Lukaku managed 44 appearances for Chelsea during his first season back at Stamford Bridge, but contributed just 15 goals and made a bigger impact off the pitch as his unauthorised interview with Italian media, in which he professed his desire to return to Inter just months after leaving, saw Chelsea fans turn on the striker. He spent the past season on loan with Inter and Chelsea are ready to cut ties permanently this summer.

Liverpool confirm departures of 11 players as free agents,"Jul 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-confirm-departures-11-players-free-agents,"Reds boss Jurgen Klopp is looking to remodel his squad after a disappointing campaign and has been active in the transfer window already, landing midfielder Alexis Mac Allister from Brighton and striking a deal to add RB Leipzig's Dominik Szoboszlai for â¬70m.

Chelsea are happy to part ways with Lukaku this summer but have rejected Inter's attempts to secure another loan deal, with the Blues pushing for a commitment from Inter to purchase the striker outright. The stumbling block, however, has been Inter's precarious financial situation.

Why would Liverpool want Dominik Szoboszlai?,"Jun 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/why-would-liverpool-want-dominik-szoboszlai,"James Milner, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Naby Keita and Fabio Carvalho will not be at the club next season, leaving the ageing trio of Fabinho, Jordan Henderson and Thiago Alcantara together with the youthful prospects Stefan Bajcetic and Harvey Elliott. Consequently, Liverpool have been linked with almost every single half-decent midfielder in Europe. They got the Alexis Mac Allister deal over the line very early and an agreement for RB Leipzig's Dominik Szoboszlai has gathered pace. Here's why Liverpool are so keen on plugging one of their holes in midfield with Szoboszlai. While there is a big desire to bring in a defensive midfielder, Liverpool clearly want to score a lot of goals from midfield next season. Mac Allister is attack-minded with a track record of finding the net and the same can be said for Szoboszlai. Szoboszlai scored ten goals from midfield for RB Leipzig in the 2022/23 season after making 48 appearances, showing both how important he is to the Bundesliga side and also how prolific he can be from the midfield. He also chipped in with 13 assists across all competitions.  The Red Bull graduate is incredibly technically gifted and he stands at a commanding 1.87 metres (6'1). He has the physical profile of a player who can transfer to the Premier League well and can be of use in both boxes. His passing range is excellent and even with a big fee, it could be a very smart piece of business. Across his whole career, Szoboszlai's output has been impressive; in just 226 games he has scored 64 times and provided 73 assists. Another major point in his favour is his incredible versatility, proving to be as comfortable on either flank as he is in the middle of the pitch.

There was competition from Newcastle for the 22-year-old midfielder but that seems to have dissipated and he is the Reds' to lose at this stage.  In terms of the transfer fee, the release clause in Szoboszlai's contract means Liverpool will have to pay Â£60m. There are conflicting reports about whether that has expired, but regardless it shows the Merseysiders will have to part with a lot of money to ensure they get the Hungarian. 90min understands the club are confident they can haggle Leipzig down to Â£50m. The deal is separate from the negotiations that will see Carvalho spend a year on loan at Leipzig and the interest in the likes of Southampton's Romeo Lavia and Nice's Khephren Thuram is not expected to go away even if this deal is completed. Jurgen Klopp's side are also still looking at Celta Vigo's Gabri Veiga."

They have since switched their attentions to former Manchester City wide-man Torres, with BarÃ§a open to a sale. 90min understands that Villa's talks with Barcelona have been productive and have progressed throughout the week, but the major stumbling block is Torres' reluctance to head to the West Midlands. Ansu Fati has similarly been linked with a move to England but is also resisting a transfer away from Catalonia. Reports in Spain suggest Barcelona are frustrated with the duo's unwillingness to leave. feed Speaking to Spanish media this week, Torres insisted he was focusing on his holidays ahead of returning to BarÃ§a for pre-season. ""Today, I am at BarÃ§a, but football takes many turns. I have the phone on airplane mode, on July 10 [the start of pre-season], I will open it,"" he said. ""I'm just focused on what's mine, training, taking advantage of the pre-season that I couldn't do last year [due to injury] and from here on, showing that I'm a great footballer. In the next few days you will have news."" Torres has failed to nail down a starting spot at Barcelona since signing from Manchester City back in January 2022. In 71 games for La Blaugrana, he's scored 14 goals and registered nine assists."
Luis Enrique to launch Bernardo Silva bid after PSG appointment,"Jun 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/luis-enrique-bernardo-silva-bid-after-psg-appointment,"Current manager Christophe Galtier is expected to be dismissed imminently and a deal for Enrique, who was on the radars of both Chelsea and Tottenham earlier this summer, is close to being finalised. During Enrique's negotiations with the club, PSG's long-standing interest in Silva was discussed and sources have confirmed to 90min that the Spaniard has given the green light to a bid being launched for the City midfielder. Silva, who is understood to have a close relationship with PSG advisor Luis Campos from the pair's mutual time in Monaco, has confirmed to City that he wants to leave the club this summer and has attracted no shortage of interest. Barcelona have long been keen on Silva but are unlikely to be able to afford to meet City's Â£75m asking price, while an Â£80m-a-year offer has been made to the 28-year-old from Saudi Arabia. feed PSG are ready to launch a bid for Silva, who they see as an ideal replacement for Lionel Messi. Campos has already spoken with the City midfielder's entourage but it was made clear that Silva would not approve a move to Paris until a replacement for Galtier was in place. Now that Enrique is ready to take over, PSG will accelerate their pursuit of Silva, who already has 101 Ligue 1 appearances to his name and was part of the Monaco side that famously pipped PSG to the title in 2016/17. The offer from Saudi Arabia remains on the table for Silva but 90min understands he is not interested in leaving Europe at this point in his career. City will not stand in the way of an exit for Silva this summer, as is their stance with every wantaway player, but want fair compensation for an elite midfielder whose contract still has two years left to run."
Is Man City target Josko Gvardiol worth â¬100m?,"Jun 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/is-man-city-target-josko-gvardiol-worth-100m,"After breaking into Dinamo Zagreb's first team, Marcelo Bielsa's Leeds United launched a hefty bid for the precocious teenager in 2020. Gvardiol was under pressure from his own club to join the Yorkshire outfit but felt it was too soon in his development. Instead, he agreed a deal with RB Leipzig and stayed in Croatia for another season on loan. Chelsea reportedly tabled a â¬90m bid for Gvardiol last summer which the defender countered by signing a contract extension at Leipzig. However, Gvardiol has decided that this is the year to join the Premier League.  90min understands personal terms have been agreed with Manchester City but RB Leipzig are demanding a record-breaking â¬100m fee. Gvardiol knows his worth better than anyone but should City cough up such an eye-watering sum? Player Transfer fee Year signed Selling club Buying club Harry Maguire â¬87m 2019 Leicester Man Utd Matthijs de Ligt â¬85.5m 2019 Ajax Juventus Virgil van Dijk â¬84.7m 2018 Southampton Liverpool Wesley Fofana â¬80.4m 2022 Leicester Chelsea Lucas Hernandez â¬80m 2019 Atletico Madrid Bayern Munich Ruben Dias â¬71.6m 2020 Benfica Man City Achraf Hakimi â¬68m 2021 Inter PSG Matthijs de Ligt â¬67m 2022 Juventus Bayern Munich Marc Cucurella â¬65.3m 2022 Brighton Chelsea Joao Cancelo â¬65m 2019 Juventus Man City Data via Transfermarkt While their city neighbours hold the current record with the purchase of Harry Maguire in 2019, Manchester City are no strangers to splashing the cash on a defender. Of the 20 most expensive defensive transfers in history, City have signed six of them under Pep Guardiola. Aymeric Laporte and Joao Cancelo are expected to move on this summer while Benjamin Mendy's contract has expired and Kyle Walker has drawn admiring glances from Bayern Munich. Of City's dear half-dozen, only John Stones and Ruben Dias are sure of a spot in next season's squad. Virgil van Dijk briefly held the record of the world's most expensive defender before United were fleeced by Leicester City. Gvardiol idolised the Liverpool centre-back as a teenager and may well line up opposite him in the Premier League after the summer. Gvardiol emerged as City's top central defensive transfer target as early as April. In the wake of a hugely impressive World Cup - notwithstanding the runaround he was given by Messi in the semi-final - the initial asking price for the Croatia international was floated at around â¬87m.  However, that figure has since ballooned to â¬100m. City are adamant they will not crack nine digits and have already shown their willingness to walk away from negotiations this summer. Unlike the Declan Rice saga, where Arsenal's long-standing interest and eagerness made them favourites, City are the front runners in the race for Gvardiol. Chelsea haven't entirely given up hope of nabbing the 21-year-old and Real Madrid are also interested but Gvardiol is not the priority for either side. City are confident they can finalise a deal this summer, with the final fee likely to exceed Maguire's record sum but come in at under â¬100m. feed Laporte's impending Etihad exit is one of the reasons why City are so keen on signing Gvardiol, who would serve as a perfect replacement. Following the arrival of Laporte for a club-record Â£57m in 2018, Guardiola explained how a naturally left-footed centre-back opens up a raft of new passing angles out from the back. ""When you receive to go to the right, you have to go inside, because you want to go to the right foot,"" the manager outlined. ""In the left, you go to that side, so it helps us to create this build-up [to the left, and to the right with a diagonal pass]. With the right foot, it is a little bit more complicated."" Gvardiol's status ""as a left-footer"" was also flagged as a bonus upon his arrival at RB Leipzig by the then-sporting director Markus Krosche. What Gvardiol does to the ball with that trusty left foot is just as important. Playing for a transition-based RB Leipzig team for the past two years, Gvardiol explained: ""When I win the ball, my first objective is to look ahead and play the most vertical pass possible."" Even with this direct approach, Gvardiol still posted a creditable 89% pass accuracy last season. An innate sense of control helps Gvardiol keep his head amid the fury of a football match. ""I guess that calmness and composure I have on the pitch is something I was born with,"" he said. ""It comes naturally to me."" Gvardiol's coach at RB Leipzig concurred. ""Heâs incredibly mature for his age,"" Marco Rose reported, ""both on and off the ball."" To underline the range of skills at Gvardiol's disposal just four years after his senior debut, his former neighbour and youth team coach Vedran Peric argued: ""It's his heading that makes him special."" There is another debate entirely as to whether any footballer should ever be worth as much as â¬100m. However, based on the precedent set by previous transfers, that price tag would be value for money if Gvardiol rises above the rest of his peers. According to his national team manager Zlatko Dalic, he already has. ""The way he plays, with the grace he controls the ball, it's amazing,"" Dalic lauded last year. ""Gvardiol is the best central defender in the world."""
West Ham advancing talks to sign Harvey Barnes from Leicester,"Jun 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-advancing-talks-sign-harvey-barnes-leicester,"The Hammers are looking to strengthen their squad after qualifying for this season's Europa League, courtesy of their first trophy success in 43 years. Declan Rice's imminent Â£105m move to Arsenal, which is only being held up by the finer details of how quickly the money will be paid, is expected to fund significant activity transfer in the window, with West Ham also looking for recruits in defence, midfield and attack. Sources have told 90min that West Ham's plans potentially include signing two wingers - the first of whom could be Barnes from recently relegated Leicester. The 25-year-old scored a career-best 13 Premier League goals last season but was unable to prevent Leicester from dropping into the second tier, just seven years after they famously lifted the title. Newcastle, Aston Villa and Tottenham have shown interest in Barnes but 90min understands that West Ham are advancing negotiations with Leicester over a move to London Stadium. Barnes' arrival would provide quality depth for David Moyes as he bids to improve on West Ham's disappointing Premier League performance last season - their victory in Europe was overshadowed by losing 20 of their 38 games en route to a 14th place finish. feed Leicester have already sold James Maddison to Tottenham Hotspur in a deal that could eventually be worth Â£45m, though West Ham will hope a move for Barnes, who has a single England international cap to his name, can be pushed through for less. The Hammers' other transfer targets could be determined by incoming technical director Tim Steidten, whose last role was in a similar capacity at Bayer Leverkusen. Currently, West Ham are showing an active interest in Ajax's Edson Alvarez - his move to Borussia Dortmund appears to be off after hitting a snag - but they are also tracking Joao Palhinha, Kalvin Phillips, Denis Zakaria and Amadou Onana as they ponder how to best replace Rice. In terms of outgoings, Roma are still hoping to push through a move for Italian striker Gianluca Scamacca after his difficult first season in England, but West Ham may be reluctant to sanction a move of any kind unless they are able to bring in further competition for Michail Antonio. Arsenal's Folarin Balogun is a player West Ham have made contact over, but he has significant interest in his services from a number of other Premier League teams, as well as from abroad."
Liverpool in advanced talks to sign Dominik Szoboszlai,"Jun 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-advanced-talks-sign-dominik-szoboszlai,"The Reds are continuing their search for new midfielders this transfer window following a disappointing 2022/23 season. They have already signed Alexis Mac Allister from Brighton & Hove Albion and remain interested in Bayern Munich's Ryan Gravenberch. 90min reported earlier this week Liverpool had touched base with the representatives of Szoboszlai over a summer move. There was initial hesitance that a deal could be agreed with RB Leipzig due to his Â£60m release clause, but 90min understands talks have reached an advanced stage and Liverpool are hopeful of agreeing a fee closer to the Â£50m mark. feed Liverpool have a great relationship with clubs in the Red Bull network having completed various transfers in the past, including Naby Keita and Ibrahima Konate from Leipzig as well as Takumi Minamino from Salzburg. Fabio Carvalho's season-long loan move to RB Leipzig was confirmed on Friday. Discussions for this deal have been kept separate to those regarding Szoboszlai. Newcastle United had also expressed an interest in signing Szoboszlai after missing out on the signing of James Maddison, who has joined Tottenham Hotspur instead. However, sources have told 90min the Magpies have stepped back from the race for the Hungary international. They will sign a midfielder in the near future though, with a club-record deal for Milan's Sandro Tonali close to completion."
Hakim Ziyech's move to Saudi Arabia at risk of collapse,"Jun 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/hakim-ziyech-move-saudi-arabia-risk-of-collapse,"The Moroccan has been deemed surplus to requirements at Stamford Bridge for some time. He came close to joining PSG on an initial loan at the back-end of the January transfer window but the move fell through as the French champions didn't register him by the Ligue 1 deadline. 90min reported earlier in June that Ziyech had agreed terms on a three-year contract at Al Nassr, where he would become a teammate of Cristiano Ronaldo. However, after travelling to Saudi Arabia to finalise the deal, an issue arose during the winger's medical and Al Nassr tried to alter their contract offer. feed The two parties could not come to a new agreement, though 90min understands that Chelsea hope the issue can be resolved and are willing to lower their Â£8m asking price in order to push the deal through. Ziyech was set to be the third Chelsea player sold to the Saudi Pro League in the last week. Kalidou Koulibaly left for Al Hilal on Sunday, while Edouard Mendy's move to Al Ahli was confirmed on Wednesday. N'Golo Kante will officially join champions Al Ittihad when his contract expires on Saturday, with Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Mason Mount also nearing the Stamford Bridge exit door to join AC Milan and Manchester United respectively."

He is said to have a â¬17.5m release clause and has been tracked by BarÃ§a's Clasico rivals Real Madrid as well as Arsenal and Newcastle. New sporting director Deco recently flew to Turkey for talks with Fenerbahce and Laporta has now revealed the deal should be given the sign-off from La Liga. He said to Esport3: ""Deco was in Istanbul, he says that [Guler] is a great talent. feed ""Now, La Liga allow us to carry out the operations that do not count for this year. Our scouting department was following him. We are trying to complete the deal."" Guler broke into Fenerbahce's first team set-up last season with three goals and three assists in the league and made his senior bow for Turkey in November 2022. He also netted his first international goal in a 2-0 Euro 2024 qualifier victory over Wales. BarÃ§a's prospects in the transfer market have been affected by off-field scandals and financial mismanagement in recent years. Laporta recently hit out at a 'campaign against BarÃ§a' over the Negreira case which lead to a ban from the Champions League. The arrival of Ilkay Gundogan has been confirmed after the midfielder's starring role in Manchester City's treble-winning campaign of 2022/23 while stalwarts Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba have departed."

That form has attracted the attention of some of Europe's top clubs. 90min has long reported he is of interest to Barcelona and Real Madrid, while representatives of Premier League teams have watched him extensively in recent months. Veiga's contract contains a â¬40m release clause and Celta Vigo have been adamant that this needs to be triggered if the midfielder is to leave Balaidos this summer. 90min understands that Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Newcastle United have all indicated that they would be willing to meet this sum up front or pay a little extra if paid in instalments. The quartet have recently held talks with agent Zahavi regarding Veiga's future, while Marseille and Serie A holders Napoli have also registered an interest. feed Chelsea are on the lookout for a Mason Mount replacement having agreed to sell their academy graduate to Manchester United for an initial Â£55m.

Pau Torres to undergo Aston Villa medical after deal agreed,"Jun 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/pau-torres-aston-villa-medical-deal-agreed,"The 26-year-old, who has just one year remaining on his contract, quickly emerged as Unai Emery's number one defensive target and talks have accelerated over the past few weeks. 90min revealed at the beginning of June that Villa were looking at both Torres and Manchester City's Aymeric Laporte, with the intention of strengthening Emery's backline ahead of a return to European competition next season. Sources have now confirmed to 90min that a deal has been agreed for Torres, who also drew interest from Juventus and Bayern Munich, and he is set to ink a five-year contract to join his former manager at Villa Park.

Most expensive English forwards ever,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/most-expensive-english-forwards-ever,"While contemporary elite teams must press aggressively, build-up from the back efficiently, control contests and sustain attacks at will, the primitive aims of football have remained the same since its inception: you've got to score more goals than the other team to win. Many will argue there's no position in the game more important than the centre forward. While our concept of the position has become more abstract over time, this player's primary goal is to help his team put the ball in the back of the net as much as possible. These players hold a ton of value, with teams paying huge fees to ensure they snag reliability in front of goal. Here are the ten most expensive English forwards of all time - wingers included. Was there ever any doubt that Rooney would blossom into a superstar? No, absolutely not.After embarking on one of the biggest breakout campaigns at Euro 2004 that announced Wazza to the world stage, Rooney earned a move to English behemoths Manchester United for Â£27m.Upon his arrival, Sir Alex Ferguson described the bullish forward as the ""best young player this country has seen in the past 30 years"". Despite all the pressure and expectations, Rooney cemented himself as a Red Devil icon and he's regarded as one of the best forwards England has ever produced. Madueke somewhat got lost amid Todd Boehly's unprecedented cash influx during his first year of ownership. Chelsea prised the former Tottenham academy star away from PSV for Â£29m midway through the 2022/23 season.The Blues' woeful squad balance rendered Madueke's start to life at the Bridge tough, but he did impress on occasions and may well head into the Mauricio Pochettino era as a starter down Chelsea's right.However, many wonder just how high the young winger's ceiling actually is. Aston Villa smashed their transfer record to sign Watkins from Brentford after the striker came ever so close to guiding the Bees into the Premier League.Watkins has endured lean spells in the top flight but also enjoys runs where he looks like the most prolific forward in the division. After struggling towards the end of Steven Gerrard's tenure, Watkins was emboldened by Unai Emery's arrival and subsequently scored 11 goals in 12 league games.His purple patches are majestic. Convinced by Jose Mourinho to switch London for Rome, Tammy's overseas gamble immediately paid off as he enjoyed a stellar debut season in the Eternal City.The athletic forward swiftly established himself as a fan favourite among Romanisti after joining for Â£34m in 2021. He scored the most goals by an Englishman in a single season in 2021/22 as well as the most strikes by any Roma player during their debut campaign.The striker's second season didn't prove quite as fruitful, but he's still very much revered on Italian shores. One of the all-time Premier League flops.Carroll was brought in alongside some fella from Ajax called Luis Suarez and tasked with rejuvenating Liverpool's front line following the departure of Fernando Torres to Chelsea.The towering Geordie, however, had just one big night for the Reds as he scored six Premier League goals before departing after 18 torrid months. This was certainly a sizeable fee given Gordon's modest Premier League record, but cash is quite literally an object for the Newcastle owners and Gordon undoubtedly flashed some impressive talent during his time at Everton.He only played a bit-part role for the Magpies during his first few months at the club, but his minutes are expected to increase with the club poised to compete on both domestic and continental fronts. After evolving into a relentless output machine under Pep Guardiola, Sterling opted for pastures new in 2022 and signed for Thomas Tuchel's Chelsea.However, the situation in west London proved to be far more unstable than Sterling could've ever imagined and he ended up playing under four managers during his debut season. While we rarely saw the England international at his very best, he was one of Chelsea's better performers as he notched nine Premier League goal contributions.Brighter times lie ahead for Sterling under Pochettino. Him again.Sterling played a stellar supporting role for Liverpool in 2013/14 as 'SAS' took the division by storm. Daniel Sturridge and especially Luis Suarez took all the headlines during the club's title tilt while young Sterling was quietly making a name for himself.He joined Manchester City in 2015 much to the dismay of Liverpool supporters and after a difficult start in Manchester, Sterling came into his own under Pep Guardiola and will be remembered as one of the Premier League's all-time great wingers. A transfer saga that bored us all to death over several windows eventually culminated in Sancho joining United for just shy of Â£73m to much fanfare.After dazzling in the Bundesliga with Borussia Dortmund and establishing himself as an England international, Sancho was regarded as a talent who could take Man Utd to the next level.Unfortunately, though, that hasn't yet been the case. There have been glimpses, sure, but nowhere near enough. Although, many will claim he hasn't been put in the best position (literally at times) to thrive. His United record thus far is bitterly disappointing: 12 goals and six assists in 79 games. A Grealish carry job led Aston Villa to safety in 2020/21 and the larger than life Brummie earned a record-breaking move to Man City off the back of it. A distinct figure on and off the pitch, Grealish endured a subdued debut campaign before coming into his own in year two. While he didn't contribute massively on the goals and assists front, Pep Guardiola will tell you just how significant the Englishman was to City's success in 2022/23.  manual"

Indeed, former Liverpool midfielder Emre Can is set to be offered a new contract and a move for Wolfsburg's Felix Nmecha is being lined up. That's opened the door for West Ham to re-enter the race for Alvarez, at a time when they are beginning to prepare for life after captain Declan Rice. Arsenal have agreed the structure of a Â£105m deal for the 24-year-old - a record transfer fee for a British player - and are now ironing out the finer details before a medical takes place. feed Alvarez, a defensive midfielder who can also play at centre-back, has long been admired by West Ham - he's also courted interest from Chelsea and Manchester United in the past - and there was previously an expectation that a bid would be put in by the Hammers to test Ajax's Â£40m valuation. West Ham are imminently set to welcome Tim Steidten as their new technical director, with his appointment likely to influence the club's transfer policy this summer Joao Palhinha and Kalvin Phillips are two players the club have near the top of their current target list, 90min understands, while interest is also held in Denis Zakaria, who spent last season on loan at Chelsea, and Amadou Onana. All four are viewed as attainable targets despite their varying market values. There's also an appetite to strengthen West Ham's Europa Conference League-winning squad with a new centre-back and wide forward - a number of players have been shortlisted both at home and abroad."

Manchester City and Manchester United were also monitoring developments from afar, though it was believed at the time that Chelsea were leading the race for his signature. However, sources have told 90min that negotiations between Arsenal and Nwaneri have progressed to the extent that an agreement is now in place. The teenager will sign scholarship terms at the Emirates Stadium, before putting pen to paper on a professional contract in March 2024, when he turns 17. feed His new deal is another boost for Arsenal, who are enjoying an exciting summer transfer window after finishing as runners-up to Manchester City in the Premier League last season. A Â£105m fee has been agreed to take Declan Rice to Arsenal from West Ham, while Kai Havertz's move to north London from rivals Chelsea was confirmed on Wednesday night.

Juventus & Dortmund join Premier League clubs interested in Daniel Jebbison,"Jun 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/juventus-dortmund-join-premier-league-clubs-interested-daniel-jebbison,"Juventus, Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen have been following Jebbison for some time and are now gearing up making a move for the 19-year-old forward. It is understood a number of clubs were watching him closely during the recent Under-20 World Cup, where he featured in three of Englandâs four games. There is also huge interest within the Premier League too, with Newcastle, Tottenham, Everton and Aston Villa also keeping close tabs on the situation. feed Jebbison is one a number of key players at Bramall Lane who have just a year left on their current deal. The clubâs issues in finding a new owner are hampering their plans to tie down players with Sander Berge and Iliman NâDiaye are also drawing major interest. Now, the Blades are set to face a huge battle to hang onto Jebbison, who could sign a pre-contract with an oversea club in little over six months' time. The teenage striker has come through Sheffield United's youth system after his family emigrated from Canada when he was 13.Â It wasn't long before Jebbison was soon making an impact at first-team level and became the youngest player in the Premier League history to score on his full debut, netting against Everton aged just 17 and 309 days."
Most expensive English goalkeepers ever,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/most-expensive-english-goalkeepers-ever,"Despite the apparent simplicity of the function, there might not be a position that's changed so drastically in recent years in terms of what's expected of a goalkeeper. The capacity to stop the ball from hitting the back of the net is no longer enough. Contemporary shot-stoppers, thanks to several revolutionaries, must be more than adept with their feet and act like a sweeper behind their defensive line. It's a tough job and England haven't been blessed with an array of world-leading goalkeepers in recent years. That's reflected by the modest transfer fees that constitute the ten most expensive English goalkeepers in history. The Man Utd academy graduate enjoyed a whopping ten loan spells over seven years before moving to West Brom for Â£5m in 2018.Johnstone had impressed on loan at Aston Villa in the second tier, but his stout form didn't quite permeate into his time at the Hawthorns. His first two seasons were mixed as the Baggies enjoyed success, returning to the Premier League in 2020.Fans questioned whether Johnstone should be the club's number one heading into their return campaign in the top flight, but the club retained their faith in the Englishman and he enjoyed an excellent season which saw him earn a call-up to Gareth Southgate's Euro 2020 squad. Before becoming everybody's favourite YouTuber and Ryan Reynolds' best mate, Foster was a consistently steady Premier League shot-stopper.His big break came at Man Utd, but it was with Watford where he first garnered plenty of plaudits. Foster earned a Â£6m move to Birmingham in 2010, but he'd spend just one year at the club following their relegation to the second tier. An excellent 2000/01 season with Coventry convinced Liverpool to make a 20-year-old Kirkland the most expensive British goalkeeper ever at the time.The Reds sent Â£6m Coventry's way, but Kirkland largely spent his debut season as Jerzy Dudek's understudy. He eventually broke into the team during his second season before injuries started to take their toll on the young shot-stopper.In the end, Kirkland spent five years at Liverpool (including two loan spells elsewhere) and made just 45 appearances for the club before departing for Wigan in 2006. Wright enjoyed a prosperous six-year spell at Ipswich and upon his arrival at Arsenal in 2001, Arsene Wenger believed he had signed David Seaman's long-term successor.However, Wenger's initial outlook couldn't have been more erroneous.Injuries to Seaman meant Wright was given ample opportunity to shine during his debut season, but frequent errors rendered his position at the club untenable and he left Highbury after just one year. Heaton was capable of producing some otherworldly performances during his impressive stint at Burnley's number one.The traditional and fundamentally sound shot-stopper earned an Â£8m move to the historically significant Aston Villa but he enjoyed just one campaign as the club's number one following Emiliano Martinez's arrival in 2020. You might not like the short sleeves, but such a unique (and wrong) aesthetic is yet to hinder Pope's competence between the sticks, especially at Newcastle.After succeeding Heaton at Burnley, Pope enjoyed several stout seasons at Turf Moor before joining an incredibly exciting project at St James' Park. The England international's debut season on Tyneside was excellent as he finished the campaign with the second-most clean sheets in the Premier League, while Newcastle boasted the joint-best defensive record in the division.Bargain. Forster forged a lofty reputation for his work at Celtic, earning a Â£10m move to Southampton.The towering keeper spent eight years on the south coast and made 134 Premier League appearances for the Saints. After starring initially, Forster endured several rough patches during his stint with the club and was usurped by Alex McCarthy as their number one towards the end of his tenure. Young Ramsdale impressed for Bournemouth during their miserable 2019/20 campaign and Sheffield United spent what was then the second-highest fee paid for any British goalkeeper in history to bring him home.Ramsdale had spent the latter stages of his youth career with the Blades, but his homecoming wasn't a prosperous one. While the keeper impressed on an individual level, his side were dismal and finished rock bottom in the Premier League table. While many laughed at Arsenal for paying Â£30m for a goalkeeper who had just suffered back-to-back relegations, Mikel Arteta certainly knew what he was doing.It didn't take long for Ramsdale to usurp Bernd Leno as Arsenal's number one given his profiency in possession and he's since emerged as one of the Premier League's very best goalkeepers. While he's not yet the finished project, Ramsdale has cemented himself as a fan favourite in north London and is a cornerstone of Arteta's project. Ramsdale has earned several England caps off the back of his form for Arsenal, but he's not yet the Three Lions' number one because this guy is still around.Pickford drew plenty of criticism during his first couple of years at Everton and many have questioned whether he is England's best goalkeeper. That may still be up for debate, but Pickford's stellar performances for both club and country when its mattered most has seen him garner the respect of pretty much everybody.A cult hero. manual"
Where should Harry Kane go this summer?,"Jun 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/where-should-harry-kane-go-this-summer,"Tottenham Hotspur had informed their star striker that he would not be allowed to leave this window. Europe's top clubs initially expected Spurs to keep hold of him. But Bayern Munich have started to test the waters, submitting a â¬70m bid for Kane earlier this week. Tottenham denied that it even came in, but if it did it would be rejected out of hand. 90min understands Kane's camp have made Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain aware of developments. Spurs might not get the quiet summer they had been hoping for. So where should Kane go if he's afforded an exit this summer? Should he even leave at all? Let's assess his options. feed Chelsea's hiring of Tottenham legend Pochettino could throw the cat among the pigeons. 90min reported in April that Spurs were braced for the Blues to show an interest in Kane due to this appointment. But Pochettino took the Chelsea job because he couldn't stay unemployed forever. Kane won't have such a narrow choice of options if he decides to leave Tottenham and is aware of the implications it would have on his legacy. PSG are coming to the needed end of their superstar cycle. If any club is in need of a rebuild, it's them. Does it make sense for Kane to join such a project at this time, even if it came with the promise of winning a LEGACY ALTERING AND DEFINING Ligue 1 title? No. It probably makes even less sense on PSG's side. The expectation among Spurs fans towards the start of Kane's rise was that if he were to leave, he would join the biggest club in the country. Man Utd are indeed interested in Kane and their fans chanted 'we'll see you in June' to the striker during their 2-2 draw at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium near the end of the 2022/23 season. But Daniel Levy's stance will likely make such a move impossible - he would prefer not to sell domestically and Man Utd would prefer simply not to talk to him. Bayern Munich have courted Kane for a year in belief they can convince him to join. It seems they have turned his head and part of the pitch is leading them to Champions League glory. That scans considering they've won 11 Bundesliga titles in a row and are probably using those famous spherical trophies to serve entrees at parties. But Bayern Munich are still Bayern Munich - it's a privilege alone to be their star player and starting striker. Real Madrid have always admired Kane, and the sudden departure of Karim Benzema could see them advance their interest. The problem for Los Blancos is the possibility of signing Kylian Mbappe either this summer or next - can they really afford both if they're not free transfers? If heading to the Santiago Bernabeu is an option, then Kane should take it without hesitation. He may have to wait for that opening, however. If Kane is still in north London come September, it's likely the primary reason will be that Tottenham remained stern in their approach to bids. That should suit him. From January onwards, Kane would be in control of his destiny. He could speak to foreign clubs freely, get a little auction started, see if any other big-hitters make a play. Kane still has his sights set on breaking Alan Shearer's Premier League goal record later in his career. Staying at Spurs for one more season would help him chip away at that tally and take the pressure off returning to England in his prime, give him another opportunity to end the club's trophy drought without needing to focus on European competition. It's time for one last dance."
Most expensive English defenders ever,"Jul 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/most-expensive-english-defenders-ever,"With almost every elite-level side incessant on playing out from the back and deploying aggressive defensive lines, the acquisition of defenders capable of performing such tasks has become a necessity. The modern-day demands combined with inflation has seen transfer fees for defenders sky rocket in recent years. Here are the ten most expensive English defenders ever. After shining on loan, Milan completed the Â£30m purchase of Tomori in the summer of 2021 before he embarked on the best season of his career during the Rossoneri's Scudetto win.Tomori's exceptional season made his permanent arrival worthwhile and the lack of interest from the national team has been curious.The former Chelsea man will be looking to rebound after enduring a down year in 2022/23. Keane was a sturdy figure for Sean Dyche's Burnley, and his form, which also resulted in 12 England caps, convinced Everton to spend Â£30m to bring him to Goodison Park.His steady form initially continued with the Toffees before declining after he penned a five-year extension in 2020. His belter against Tottenham during the backend of 2022/23 is his undisputed highlight in Everton colours. Man Utd broke the English transfer record to sign Leeds hotshot Ferdinand in 2002.United's Â£30m purchase meant the Englishman became the most expensive defender in history for the second time after losing his first title to Lillian Thuram in 2001.Sir Alex Ferguson had no doubts that Ferdinand would blossom into a superstar at Old Trafford, and the archetypal modern-day defender certainly didn't disappoint. Shaw has enjoyed quite the rollercoaster at Man Utd after joining the club as a precocious teenager from Southampton in 2014.The left-back has battled serious injuries and felt the wrath of Jose Mourinho during his time at the club, but he's emerged from the dark clouds and developed into one of the Premier League's best in his position.He's played a starring role for the national team in recent years, while the stellar form he's displayed for the Red Devils garnered him a new contract at the end of the 2022/23 season. Injuries have plagued his time at Chelsea, but there's no denying Chilwell's status as one of the most dynamic full-backs in the Premier League.He joined the Blues after breaking through at Leicester in the wake of their Premier League title triumph. Chelsea spent Â£45m to bring him to Stamford Bridge, where he's since lifted the Champions League.It's been a frustrating period for the England international, but he's set to become a pivotal figure under Mauricio Pochettino after extending his contract in April. Mauricio Pochettino converted the raw Walker into the most coveted full-back in the land and he made a Â£45m move to City after Tottenham's stellar 2016/17 season during which he starred as an up-and-down wing-back.Walker's evolution has been pretty remarkable under Pep Guardiola in Manchester and he'll be remembered as perhaps one of most under-appreciated full-backs of his generation.The Sheffield-born defender has won the lot at the Etihad. The 'Barnsley Beckenbauer' has come into his own after several difficult years at City, and he was instrumental in the club's treble triumph.Injuries and inconsistency for a long time undermined his time in Manchester, but he's emerged as one of Europe's very best defenders in recent years, excelling with the national team, too.Guardiola's utilisation of Stones in an utterly unique centre-back hybrid role kick-started their magical end to 2022/23. United's purchase of Crystal Palace defender Wan-Bissaka certainly raised a few eyebrows at the time and the concerns of many quickly manifested.While the right-back is arguably the best one-on-one defender in the game, his limitations on the ball are distinct (although he's certainly improved in this regard) and he hasn't lived up to his pretty hefty price tag.Wan-Bissaka has drifted in and out of the United starting XI since his arrival, with managers often deploying him as a specialist tasked with shutting down a particular opponent. White's rise from Newport County loanee to Â£50m man was swift. The confident defender shone in aggressive, proactive systems under Marcelo Bielsa at Leeds and Graham Potter at Brighton before Arsenal made their move ahead of the 2021/22 season.Athletic and technically proficient, White starred in north London during his first two seasons, with Mikel Arteta successfully converting him into a two-way full-back. Oh, Harry.He was pretty much doomed from the get-go. A bidding war between the two Manchester clubs eventually culminated in United spending the biggest amount to sign any English defender (Â£78m). Put under immediate scrutiny, Maguire has found it tough at Old Trafford despite some excellent spells. The club captain was reduced to a bit-part role by Erik ten Hag and there are serious questions over where his future resides. manual"
Mason Mount: Chelsea & Man Utd schedule further talks over transfer,"Jun 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/mason-mount-chelsea-man-utd-schedule-further-talks-transfer,"United have already failed with three bids for the England international, the last of which was worth Â£55m, and they had threatened to walk away from the negotiating table if that offer was rejected. However, United left that offer on the table for Chelsea, who were originally demanding Â£70m to sell Mount. The Blues suggested a counter-proposal worth Â£65m but 90min understands a fee of Â£60m would get the job done. Further talks between the two clubs will be held imminently with a view to a compromise, with United still determined to lure Mount to Old Trafford this summer. United have made it clear that they will not bow to Chelsea's demands and predicted a drop in Mount's asking price, which has decreased Â£10m since talks were opened, but whether they will increase their third offer is unclear. feed United are concerned about paying over the odds for a player who is in the final year of his contract and believe their third proposal of Â£55m is more than fair considering Mount can leave for free in 12 months. Selling Mount before the end of the month would be significant for Chelsea, who have enjoyed an explosive start to the transfer window which has yielded well over Â£100m in sales already. The Blues are looking to balance the books ahead of the end of the current financial year after spending close to Â£600m on transfers over the past two windows. Kai Havertz has joined Arsenal for Â£65m and Mateo Kovacic's move to Manchester City has also earned Chelsea Â£25m, which Kalidou Koulibaly and Edouard Mendy have brought in around Â£30m with their moves to Saudi Arabia. Hakim Ziyech is expected to follow to the Middle East for under Â£10m, while Ruben Loftus-Cheek is close to joining AC Milan for Â£15m. That stream of income has strengthened Chelsea's stance in negotiations with United but there is hope from both sides that a compromise will be reached to send Mount to Old Trafford."
Real Madrid star's agent explains why Kylian Mbappe won't join this summer,"Jun 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/real-madrid-star-agent-why-kylian-mbappe-won-t-join-this-summer,"90min understands that Mbappe has told Paris Saint-Germain he will not sign a new contract beyond 2024, and the French champions do not intend to lose him for free next summer. PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has held talks with Mbappe's agent and mother, Fayza Lamari, regarding the club's transfer stance. In an interview with After Foot, the agent of France teammate Mendy, Yvan Le Mee, believes that Mbappe's refusal to appoint a representative from outside his family has cost him a move to Real Madrid. ""It's not her job, she doesn't have the ability to act. I wanted to start a restaurant but I don't know how to cook, so I didn't. For a moment, you just have to be in reality and do what you know how to do. To make arrangements for your son and other players, you should have a license,"" he said. ""I am convinced that if he had had an agent at the time of the negotiations with Real Madrid two years ago, he would have gone to Real Madrid. ""When you don't have the codes, when you don't have the uses and customs, when you talk to the leader of a historic club as if you were talking to someone you've known for a long time, maybe it doesn't work. You may not know how to handle the situation to get there. He's still in Paris and he obviously doesn't seem happy to be there."" feed Real Madrid retain their long-term interest in signing Mbappe, but Le Mee does not expect a move to go through this summer. ""It's a club that currently doesn't have the money for a transfer,"" he said of Real Madrid. ""Real Madrid cannot afford his salary, which is â¬40m net per year, plus the famous bonus of â¬30m net per year. He earns between â¬70m and â¬75m net, while Karim Benzema earned â¬13m."" Real Madrid's only natural number nine is now loanee Joselu. Harry Kane is also of interest to Los Blancos, but if they are unable to bring in another striker before the end of the window, reports in Spain claim that Carlo Ancelotti will use Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo as inverted forwards to compensate."

Should all add-ons be hit, the total fee could reach Â£45m â the recently relegated Foxes had been holding out for as much as Â£60m. Newcastle had also been in the race, but Maddison was keen on north London. Despite Leicesterâs struggles that culminated in a shock drop down to the Championship, Maddison impressed throughout the 2022/23 season. He recorded 10 Premier League goals and nine assists in 30 appearances and offers a skillset unmatched by any of his new Spurs teammates. feed The 26-year-old also played his way into the England squad, starting wins over Ukraine and Malta in March and June respectively, having previously made his debut back in 2019. Maddison started his senior career at hometown club Coventry, making his debut aged 17.

Jorginho & agent respond to Arsenal exit rumours,"Jun 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jorginho-agent-respond-arsenal-exit-rumours,"Jorginho joined Arsenal in January when he traded west for north London in a Â£12m transfer from Chelsea and quickly became an important squad player. The 31-year-old still has another season left on his contract, plus the option of a further 12 months until 2025. There is set to be increased competition should the Gunners wrap up a British record transfer for Declan Rice, but uncertainty surrounding both Thomas Partey and Granit Xhaka ensures an ongoing need for experience and options in the middle of the pitch. ""I was surprised but really happy by how welcome I was, how [Arsenal] treated me when I came in,"" Jorginho toldÂ the Evening Standard. ""It just made everything so much easier for me to know more people to integrate in the team. So it was really, really, really good and I am really, really happy. feed ""I'm very happy to stay at Arsenal to be honest. Those [Lazio] rumors, I'm not sure who was behind it, to be honest, but nothing at the moment has happened to me. I'm quite happy where I am."" Jorginho's agent Joao Santos has similarly quashed suggestions the 2021 Ballon dâOr nominee will be on the move any time soon. ""Jorginho is very happy with Arsenal who have a very important championship to play, at the beginning of August there is the Community Shield,"" Santos toldÂ TV Play in Italy. ""There is no negotiation with Lazio. I don't know if they have the money to pay the player, but that's not the question. In our mind, there is only the Gunners next season. The theme is clear - the project for next year is to stay at Arsenal which can become the most important team in England."""
Man Utd make contact with Brighton over Moises Caicedo transfer,"Jun 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-contact-brighton-moises-caicedo-transfer,"Brighton's current asking price is understood to be Â£100m - similar in number to Declan Rice, who is close to joining Arsenal for Â£105m - though it's understood that is considered an overall figure rather than an up front payment. The asking price has risen recently as Brighton feel Caicedo is worthy of similar market value to the West Ham captain, given his Premier League proven quality and age. Caicedo is still only 21. United have been targeting a new central midfielder throughout the summer window so far, and have seen three bids rejected from Chelsea for Mason Mount. United made their latest bid last Friday totalling Â£55m, which Chelsea rejected. The two clubs are expected to speak again this week to decide whether to find a middle ground and complete the transfer. Erik ten Hag's side have so far indicated no willingness to improve on their last offer. feed Caicedo, who United had the option to sign for around Â£4m in January 2021 from his native Ecuador, is seen as an alternative to Mount, even while his cost would be far higher. Chelsea themselves have been considered as leading contenders to sign Caicedo for a number of weeks and hope to complete a deal for the player. Whether or not United are prepared to stump up the money required for Caicedo remains to be seen. Ten Hag would also like to sign a new centre-back in an ideal world, as well as a new striker to take the goalscoring burden away from Marcus Rashford. There's also a huge focus on who will be in goal for United next season, with David de Gea's future at Old Trafford looking increasingly uncertain. 90min revealed on Tuesday that a contract extension had previously been agreed with the Spaniard, only for the club to renege on their offer.  The 32-year-old could end up leaving for free to be replaced by Inter's Andre Onana, who previously worked under Ten Hag at Ajax before moving to Milan."
Barcelona & Real Madrid handed transfer boosts by La Liga,"Jun 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-real-madrid-handed-transfer-boosts-la-liga,"Strict financial regulations have been enforced over the last few years and La Liga clubs have been unable to make as many lavish signings as other sides across Europe. Barcelona were notably hit hard by these restrictions when they were forced to let Lionel Messi leave on a free transfer in 2021 as they could not register his new contract under new guidelines. However, MARCA report that La Liga are ready to ease these restrictions this summer. La Liga sides must ensure that the total cost of their squad does not exceed 70% of the club's total income. Teams currently over that salary limit are currently only allowed to spend 40% of money saved or accrued in player sales, but this figure will rise to 50%. This will then increase to 60% if the player accounts for 5% of the total value of the first-team squad. feed While this should allow the likes of Barcelona, who have been seriously hampered by financial woes recently, a little more room for manoeuvre in the transfer market, these rule changes are unlikely to help them immediately and they must still sell players in order to seriously benefit from them. Other sides such as Real Betis and Almeria - who 90min understands could sell star striker El Bilal Toure to Atalanta - have been hit hardest by La Liga's regulations of late and like Barcelona still need to bring in funds through player trading. Real Madrid, meanwhile, have still been able to spend lavish sums on players, recently signing Jude Bellingham from Borussia Dortmund for an initial â¬103m."

Their search has now spread to mainland Europe and Germany in particular, with sources telling 90min that they have opened talks with Wolfsburg regarding 22-year-old Van de Ven. He is currently away at the European Under-21 Championship with the Netherlands. Van de Ven has not been capped at senior level though made the preliminary squad for the 2022 World Cup. Van de Ven is a towering centre-back standing at 6'4 but has played at left-back during his two years at Wolfsburg. Liverpool also made enquiries about him earlier this year and maintain an interest. feed Tottenham are also still in discussions with fellow Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen regarding Edmond Tapsoba. 90min reported last week that Spurs were growing concerned with rival interest in the Burkina Faso international, with Liverpool, Manchester United and Newcastle United all keeping an eye on his situation. Spurs have made a busy start to the window having already completed the signing of Dejan Kulusevski on a permanent transfer and brought in Empoli goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario. 90min reported on Wednesday that they are close to wrapping up a deal for James Maddison after agreeing a fee with Leicester City.

Declan Rice potential shirt numbers at Arsenal,"Jun 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/declan-rice-potential-shirt-numbers-arsenal,"The West Ham skipper has been a major summer target for several months and only the structure of a proposed British record deal following a Â£105m bid from the Gunners needs ironing out. Manchester City's withdrawal from the race was also a crucial domino to fall. It's a potentially transformative addition that'll undoubtedly raise expectations, and here's what shirt numbers Rice could wear for Arsenal once he joins the club. feed Explaining why he's continued to stick with this number throughout his Hammers career, Rice told Gary Neville on The Overlap: ""When you're in the U23s, you've obviously got the first-team squad numbers and then it starts to get to the higher numbers when you're in the U23s. While it is an unconventional number, Rice could stick with 41 at Arsenal. During that same interview with Neville, the 24-year-old said: ""To be honest with you, I've been having this conversation with my Dad, regardless of what happens in my career, I think I might stay with the 41."" The number was taken by Mauro Bandeira, an academy graduate, last season. Rice shouldn't have any trouble convincing the youngster to give it up."

Aurelien Tchouameni had also been a target in 2022. They have already brought in Alexis Mac Allister from Brighton this window, with plans in place to bring in one or two more midfielders. Liverpool's search has led them to Szoboszlai. 90min understands they have touched base with the Hungarian's camp over a move and he has a mutual interest in completing a switch to Merseyside. Newcastle United have also registered an interest - they are set to lose out on another key midfield target in James Maddison to Tottenham Hotspur - while other top sides from across Europe are monitoring the 22-year-old's situation. feed The major stumbling block for any club looking to buy Szoboszlai is RB Leipzig's asking price, currently demanding that his release clause of â¬70m is paid in full. They are in no rush to sell one of their star assets. Interestingly, Liverpool have already agreed to send fellow number ten Fabio Carvalho on loan to RB Leipzig for the 2023/24 season.

Man Utd coach confirms Erik ten Hag's interest in midfield target,"Jun 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-coach-confirms-erik-ten-hag-interest-midfield-target,"The Red Devils are on the hunt for reinforcements in the summer transfer window, though are yet to make a signing ahead of the 2023/24 season. 90min understands Man Utd have had three bids rejected by Chelsea for Mason Mount and are currently unwilling to meet their Â£60m asking price. They also retain an interest in Barcelona's Frenkie de Jong, who is now also being courted by Bayern Munich. While these sagas continue to rumble on, McCarthy has seemed to confirm reports that Man Utd have kept tabs on USA international Taylor Booth, who is currently at FC Utrecht in the Netherlands. feed In an interview with 947 Joburg in his native South Africa, McCarthy said Ten Hag asked his agent about Booth before bringing the former striker onto his coaching staff for the 2022/23 season. ""Erik ten Hag, the manager, came in and he spoke to my agent Rob Moore about one of the players that was playing in Holland. He asked Rob about an American player [Booth] that Rob also managed,"" he said. ""They were just speaking about that and once the conversation had ended, he asked him: 'By the way, how's Benni doing?

West Ham negotiating structure of Arsenal's Â£105m Declan Rice offer,"Jun 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-negotiating-structure-arsenal-105m-declan-rice-offer,"Rice has been at the centre of a tug-of-war involving Premier League champions City, who announced the signing of Croatian midfielder Mateo Kovacic from Chelsea for an initial Â£25m fee on Tuesday. City had a Â£90m offer for Rice turned down by West Ham on Tuesday morning, comprised of Â£80m in guaranteed money plus Â£10m in add-ons, while Arsenal have already seen two bids rejected by the Hammers. 90min reported on Arsenal's third offer late on Tuesday night, which is a total package worth Â£105m to West Ham. That's a figure that would not only represent a club-record purchase but would be a new British transfer record, surpassing the Â£100m City paid Aston Villa for Jack Grealish in 2021. The deal would also make Rice the joint-fifth most expensive player of all time. But despite getting far closer to West Ham's valuation, 90min understands that the Europa Conference League winners do not believe the structure of the deal is right.  Arsenal are currently proposing to pay the Â£100m guaranteed over a period of more than three years,  whereas West Ham are expecting to receive all of the money by 2025. The amount itself isn't regarded as a problem, making an agreement possible if the Gunners are willing to move their timeframes forward. manual The good news for Arsenal is that Manchester City, who West Ham were expecting to return with an improved offer, have decided to back away from negotiations. They will now focus their efforts on replacing Ilkay Gundogan elsewhere - he joined Barcelona on a free transfer at the beginning of the week - and could resurrect their interest in long-standing target Gabri Veiga - he has a release clause at Celta Vigo worth around Â£35m. Manchester United had been lingering in the background for Rice, though it would have taken something extraordinary from the Red Devils to be able to stump up a viable financial package, and Chelsea have also shown strong interest before focusing on Brighton's Moises Caicedo. 90min understands that Arsenal has remained Rice's preferred destination, with personal terms all but agreed on a contract at the Emirates Stadium. Manager Mikel Arteta is also closing in on two other high-profile signings, Kai Havertz and Jurrien Timber, which will take the club's total summer spending north of Â£200m."

Sources have told 90min that Torres, who has long been linked with a move to the Premier League having previously been of interest to Manchester United, has made it clear to Villarreal's hierarchy that he is ready to leave his hometown this summer. Villa have a trump card in manager Unai Emery given his prior relationship with the defender having spent much of the last two seasons in charge of Torres as Villarreal boss. Bayern Munich, Juventus and Napoli have also registered their interest in Torres this summer, but none are as anywhere near as advanced as Villa who, via their new president of football operations Monchi, are well on their way to striking a deal with Villarreal. Torres has a release clause of around Â£55m but Villa are looking to work out a deal in instalments as opposed to a one-off payment. feed And while a transfer for Torres is edging closer to completion, Villa's bid for another Spain star in Nico Willams looks to have failed. 90min revealed Villa opened talks with Williams and Athletic Club earlier this month, but the 20-year-old is now close to signing a new deal at San Mames. Williams has just 12 months left on his current contract, and although he was tempted by Villa sources have told 90min that he is ready to stay in the Basque Country for at least another season, with a new two-year contract close to being agreed."
Tottenham reach agreement to sign James Maddison from Leicester,"Jun 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-reach-agreement-to-sign-james-maddison-from-leicester,"Spurs have been locked in talks with the Foxes for much of this month in the hope of striking a deal for long-term target Maddison. 90min reported on Tuesday that a transfer was nearing with new Tottenham head coach Ange Postecoglou pushing to make Maddision one of his first summer signings. And 90min now understands that Spurs and Leicester have reached an agreement over a fee that could total Â£45m if all add-ons are met. He will shortly travel for a medical and finalise the move. Leicester, who were relegated to the Championship at the end of the 2022/23 Premier League season, had held out hope of selling Maddison for Â£60m. But 90min revealed this week that their stance changed, allowing for smoother negotiations with Tottenham. feed Newcastle United had also shown significant interest in the midfielder, but Maddison's desire to move to north London was key to the deal, with the Magpies backing away from talks in recent weeks. Leicester are also keen to push ahead with their own transfer plans this window. They have deals lined up for Wolves defender Conor Coady and Manchester City goalkeeper Zack Steffen, while Tottenham playmaker Harry Winks is also a top target but talks over that have been kept separate to those regarding Maddison. Spurs have already completed two signings this summer, making Dejan Kulusevski's loan move from Juventus permanent at a fee lower than the purchase clause in his contract, while goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario officially joined the club on Tuesday."
Arsenal make British record bid worth Â£105m for Declan Rice,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-make-british-record-bid-worth-105m-declan-rice,"The deal, if accepted, would not only smash Arsenal's all-time transfer record, but become the British transfer record - surpassing what Manchester City paid Aston Villa for Jack Grealish in 2021. The Gunners have been leading the chase for Rice all summer, but have seen two bids rejected with the last worth up to Â£90m. West Ham have been demanding more than Â£100m for the duration of negotiations. Manchester City also lodged an offer worth Â£90m earlier on Tuesday, which was also rejected by West Ham. ThougH Arsenal have returned with a third offer and 90min understands they are hopeful that West Ham will accept. The offer on the table is worth Â£105m in total, with Â£100m guaranteed and an additional Â£5m in add-ons. Arsenal are working quickly to give Mikel Arteta the squad he needs to mount another title challenge in 2024 and they already close to securing deals for Chelsea's Kai Havertz and Ajax's Jurrien Timber, who between them are likely to cost over Â£100m. That figure could soon become north of Â£200m in a matter of days if West Ham accept the offer for Rice. Rice has already agreed personal terms with Arsenal, having made it clear to all parties that a move to the Emirates was his preferred move this summer."

Paris Saint-Germain confirm transfer stance to Kylian Mbappe,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/paris-saint-germain-confirm-transfer-stance-kylian-mbappe,"Mbappe confirmed to PSG earlier this month that the option of another year on his contract, which needs to be activated by July 31, will not be utilised, meaning he will be free to leave the club next summer on a free transfer. PSG were caught off-guard by Mbappe's declaration as their belief was that even if the player was to move, he would sign an extension and that would enable them to sell in 2024. However, PSG are now in a precarious position and realise that Mbappe could sign a pre-contract with another club in January. 90min understands that talks have taken place in recent days between PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi and Fayza Lamari - Mbappe's mother and agent. During the meeting, it is understood that Al-Khelaifi made clear the club's stance. If Mbappe is not prepared to sign a new deal, they will look to sell him this summer. feed PSG officials told Lamari that they do not want the issue to turn into a saga and they would like the situation resolved sooner rather than later, indicating their preference for a quick sale. Al-Khelaifi is anxious to avoid a toxic parting of ways and insists PSG will respect the decision of Mbappe, but they do not want to see him walking away for nothing. Lamari delieved the message to her son and now PSG are awaiting the response, but sources have told 90min that they are already drawing up the package they would demand to sell Mbappe - understood to be worth around â¬200m. It remains to be seen if anyone would be willing to part with that sort of fee for Mbappe, especially given he is a free agent in 12 months. Real Madrid, who unsuccessfully tried to sign Mbappe in 2021, remain interested and they do have a hole in their squad to fill after Karim Benzema's decision to move to Saudi Arabia.  However, with Harry Kane now agitating for a move away from Tottenham, officials are exploring all possible options this summer. They have also looked closely at Inter's Lauturo Martinez and Napoli's Victor Osimhen."
Diogo Costa offered to Chelsea & Man Utd amid Porto's FFP concerns,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/diogo-costa-chelsea-man-utd-porto-ffp-concerns,"Costa is seen as one of the game's top young goalkeepers and has long been watched by Europe's elite, many of whom are considering stepping up their pursuit this summer. Chelsea and United are both in the market for goalkeepers this summer - the Blues have agreed to sell Edouard Mendy to Al Ahli and are now looking for an alternative to Kepa Arrizabalaga, while the Red Devils are considering moving on from David de Gea, who is out of contract at the end of June, after months of negotiating a new deal. 90min revealed on Tuesday that United had reneged on a previous agreement with De Gea, which included a dramatic reduction in the Spaniard's wages, and there's now every chance that he'll leave Old Trafford once his current deal ends. Costa is a player admired by Chelsea and United and sources have confirmed to 90min that Porto have offered the 23-year-old to both amid continued uncertainty over their ability to comply with Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations. feed 90min revealed in March that Porto were aware of their financial difficulties - it's estimated that they need to raise Â£45m by June 30 - and the easiest way to receive significant funds would be to cash in on Costa. The Portugal international's contract contains a release clause worth around Â£65m, but Porto's need to do a deal could be scuppered by Chelsea and United having alternative targets. Chelsea have a long-standing interest in Inter goalkeeper Andre Onana, although they have concerns over his price tag, while AC Milan's Mike Maignan is another similarly expensive target. Valencia's Giorgi Mamardashvil has admirers at Stamford Bridge too, and would likely represent better value for money should the Blues choose to act. United are also in the mix for Onana and have held talks with Inter, while Brentford's David Raya is seen as a cheaper alternative despite Brentford's insistance that a deal for the 27-year-old will cost Â£40m. Onana appears to be Erik ten Hag's preferred choice at this time, however - the pair worked together at Ajax and the United boss has previously labelled him as a ""masterful goalkeeper""."
Ryan Gravenberch discusses Bayern Munich future amid Liverpool interest,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ryan-gravenberch-bayern-munich-future-liverpool-interest,"The midfielder made the move from Ajax to the Allianz Arena last summer for a fee that could rise to â¬23m. Gravenberch was also the subject of interest from Manchester United, who are managed by his former manager from his time in Amsterdam, Erik ten Hag. But the 21-year-old struggled for regular minutes in his first season in Bavaria, making just three starts in the Bundesliga. 90min reported back in April that Gravenberch was unhappy with his situation at Bayern and had asked the club to consider letting him go if offers of first-team football came in. Liverpool are interested in signing Gravenberch and view him as a viable alternative to long-term target Jude Bellingham, who instead chose to sign for Real Madrid this summer. feed But speaking to Algemeen Dagblad, Gravenberch seemed resigned to staying at Bayern and insisted he now wants to make the move work. ""I assume that I will still play at Bayern next season. That's really how I feel about it. I am with a top three club in the world. I think that's beautiful and special. I'm not giving up easily. My goal is still to succeed at Bayern,"" he said. ""I have become more masculine and I think there is even more scope for that. It is incredible to see how players literally give everything here. Certainly other teams when they play against Bayern, as I was used to at Ajax. Players make much more ground here than in the Eredivisie."" Gravenberch is currently on duty with Netherlands at the European Under-21 Championship. Bayern, meanwhile, are interested in adding Harry Kane to their ranks this summer, though Tottenham have denied reports that they have received a bid for the striker."
"Harry Kane camp push for Spurs exit amid Bayern, Real Madrid & PSG interest","Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/harry-kane-spurs-exit-bayern-real-madrid-psg-interest,"The 29-year-old has just one year left to run on his contract in north London, though Spurs remain confident he can be persuaded to sign a new deal despite showing little inclination to do so. 90min previously reported that the general view from across Europe was that Kane, now the all-time record scorer for club and country, would stay put this summer due to Tottenham's point-blank refusal to do business. Bayern Munich have long identified Kane as one of their primary transfer targets, as they finally look to replace the guaranteed goals of Robert Lewandowski, while Real Madrid and PSG have been keeping a close eye on developments. Manchester United also have a long-standing interest in Kane but they haven't seen eye-to-eye with Spurs over their valuation, even though Erik ten Hag is desperate to bring a quality number nine in at Old Trafford. News broke on Tuesday of Bayern deciding to test the waters with a bid of around Â£60m for Kane, though sources close to Spurs told 90min that they had received no such offer. Even if a bid had been received, one in that range would be rejected out of hand anyway. Kane's representatives are understood to have stepped up talks with Bayern this month, and those discussions have given the Bundesliga champions a strong belief that they can pull off a move this summer. Indeed, 90min understands that Kane is again at the point where he's actively pushing for movement on his future, piquing the attention of both Real Madrid and PSG. feed Real Madrid particularly are taking an interest in Kane's situation having been rocked by the sudden departure of Ballon d'Or holder Karim Benzema to Saudi champions Al Ittihad. The Frenchman's exit has left Joselu, a recent loan signing from Espanyol, as Real's only recognised striker, causing somewhat of a split in the Santiago Bernabeu's corridors of power. Some key personnel want Real Madrid to pursue a move for Kane this summer and then move for Kylian Mbappe on a free next year, while others only want to bring in one of them. PSG, for context, are keen to sell Mbappe this summer to avoid losing him on a free transfer in 2024 - he has already confirmed he won't be extending his contract in the French capital. Agreeing personal terms would not be a problem for any of the aforementioned parties, with Kane accepting that a move abroad is unlikely to see his wages hit the heights of what top Premier League teams are able to offer. Whether Bayern are able to persuade Kane that a move to Germany is in his best interests remains to be seen, but they have backed away from other targets such as Randal Kolo Muani and Kai Havertz in a bid to provide Thomas Tuchel with the elite-level striker he craves."
Man Utd withdraw contract proposal for David de Gea & offer further reduced deal,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-withdraw-contract-proposal-david-de-gea-offer-further-reduced-deal,"The Spanish goalkeeper, who has been at United for 12 seasons, has entered the final week of his existing deal with the club, and doubts have shrouded his long-term future for several months - with a drop off in form and a number of mistakes holding United back in numerous fixtures over the second half of last season. United issued De Gea with an offer worth around Â£200,000 per week - this a huge reduction from the Â£375,000 a week he is earning on his existing deal - and it's understood that De Gea chose to sign that contract. However, United removed that offer following De Gea signing his side of the terms, only to then issue an even further reduced contract proposal. Erik ten Hag is keen to make a series of upgrades to his squad over the course of this summer and next, with centre half, central midfield and centre forward all priorities to strengthen dependent on how many players United can move on in those positions. Goalkeeper is also a priority - though the profile of the player they sign in that position is dependent on De Gea's decision. Ten Hag is looking for a goalkeeper with appropriate distribution and passing abilities - areas De Gea evidently lacks - and sources believe he is pushing for a new first choice to be signed whether De Gea stays or not. feed 90min understands De Gea is still mulling over the new terms offered to him - they are not described as bad in any sense - and while there is still a chance he chooses to sign, the player is upset at the way the process has been handled. No decision has been made yet and while his contract expires on Friday, he does not need to rush a decision through regardless if he is still contracted or not. De Gea does have other offers, however, namely from Saudi Arabia - as 90min reported earlier in June. The 32-year-old was expected at the time to reject proposals from a league making a massive play to sign high-profile names, but United's withdrawal of their first offer and subsequent reduced follow-up has made the situation unclear. Karim Benzema, N'Golo Kante, Ruben Neves, Kalidou Koulibaly and Hakim Ziyech are all names who have joined Cristiano Ronaldo in moving to Saudi Arabia over the last few months. Many more are expected, with greater money on offer to these names than from anywhere else in Europe. De Gea would stand to make more than even his existing contract terms at United if he decides to move to Saudi Arabia, but no decisions have been made by the player at this point. Porto need to raise â¬50m before June 30 and could potentially sell Diogo Costa to close that figure this week - United and Premier League rivals Chelsea have shown interest in the past though his departure is not as advanced as reported in Portugal at present. Inter's Andre Onana is, however, the leading candidate to become the club's next number one should they sign one, 90min understands, and United have held talks about his signing. Onana worked with Ten Hag at Ajax and received wide praise for his performance in Inter's Champions League final defeat against Manchester City, and he is regarded to be one of the best players in the world in his position at playing out of his goal, distributing the ball and starting attacks.

Tottenham confirm signing of Guglielmo Vicario,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-confirm-signing-guglielmo-vicario,"Spurs made signing a new goalkeeper one of their top priorities for the summer transfer window and have moved quickly to bring in Vicario after a move for Brentford's David Raya stalled. Personal terms had been agreed with Raya but Spurs were unable to find an agreement with Brentford over their Â£40m asking price. Attention then shifted to Vicario, who was a target for Serie A sides Inter, Juventus and Roma, while Brighton and Manchester United also watched him during the 2022/23 season. Tottenham confirmed on Tuesday that Vicario's transfer is now complete, signing a five-year contract. feed ""We are delighted to announce the signing of Guglielmo Vicario from Empoli, subject to international clearance and a work permit,"" Spurs said in a statement. ""The Italy international has signed a contract with the Club that will run until 2028 and will wear the number 13 shirt."" Vicario becomes Spurs' second signing of the summer, following on from the permanent transfer of Dejan Kulusevski from Juventus, and is expected to take over from Hugo Lloris in goal. The Frenchman has one year remaining on his contract in north London but outlined his intention to seek a new challenge. 90min understands Tottenham are progressing in talks to sign James Maddison from Leicester, with new head coach Ange Postecoglou keen to bring in the England international."
Minnesota United sign Teemu Pukki on Designated Player contract,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/minnesota-united-sign-teemu-pukki-designated-player-contract,"Pukki was available on a free transfer after his contract with EFL Championship side Norwich City expired. He spent five years in England and played two campaigns in the Premier League, scoring double digits of goals in every season at Carrow Road. In total, Pukki scored 88 goals in 210 games for the Canaries. The 33-year-old has now completed a move to Minnesota United in Major League Soccer on an initial two-year Designated Player contract. MNUFC Head Coach Adrian Heath said in a release: ""I feel as though we have gotten that goalscorer we have been craving ever since Christian Ramirez left. He's a gold standard, proven goalscorer. ""If you look at his record he's scored at a high level at every team he's played for. His goalscoring record in the Premier League, the Championship and the Finnish National Team speaks for itself.

Bayern Munich enquire about Frenkie de Jong - Man Utd retain interest,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-enquire-frenkie-de-jong-man-utd-interest,"The German champions are in the market for a new midfielder and have targeted West Ham's Declan Rice in recent weeks, though the player favours staying in the Premier League. Manchester City and Arsenal are currently in a bidding process for the player. Bayern have held interest in De Jong for some time and have touched base to assess the potential of a deal, with the Dutch midfielder a strong alternative. De Jong was also wanted by Chelsea last summer - when current Bayern coach Thomas Tuchel was in the Stamford Bridge hot seat. De Jong has been a long-term target for Erik ten Hag's Manchester United, who themselves are hoping to sign up to two midfielders for next season, and it's understood that they would be prepared to enter the mix to sign him dependent on availability - having targeted the 26-year-old through the entirety of last summer. United reached an agreement with Barcelona for the transfer to take place worth an overall â¬85m, but couldn't complete the deal due to an issue over millions of euros in deferred wages, which Barcelona owed to De Jong after he took a pay cut during the pandemic. 90min understands this problem has not yet been solved between the player's camp and the club. De Jong has always maintained publicly that he wanted to stay at Barcelona, and it remains the case that they are his dream club to play for. He established himself as a key player under Xavi last season as Barcelona won La Liga and is now established as one of the team's leaders. However, the departure of Sergio Busquets, and the replacement they choose to bring in, could still yet affect De Jong's future at some point in the summer. Barcelona are looking at signing Dani Parejo from Villarreal among other cheaper options, though Martin Zubimendi is a younger candidate and a natural fit for the pivot role that could be targeted dependent on player sales. feed Barcelona would need to raise cash to press forward with a deal for the Real Sociedad midfielder, and are looking to shift the likes of Franck Kessie, Ansu Fati and other unwanted players to raise money and give them room to maneouvre in the market. Should they not receive suitable bids for players they wish to sell, however, the club would likely consider substantial offers for established names - as evidenced with their acceptance of United's bid for De Jong last summer. 90min understands De Jong is a little worried about his playing time as Barcelona's search for a new holding midfielder to replace Busquets is live and fluid. They are expected to sign a cheaper and more experienced option to fill a gap in the squad but could yet sign a first choice dependent on circumstances. Alongside Zubimendi, Marcelo Brozovic of Inter has been targeted - though is considering an offer from Saudi Arabia - while Bayern's Joshua Kimmich's future is not yet decided amid public interest from Barcelona. Kimmich is well-liked by Xavi, who told Mundo Deportivo earlier in June that ""if there is an open door, there will be a negotiation with Bayern"" for a player he once called ""one of the best in the world"". ""What is clear is that we need a player of a very high level in that position, otherwise, it will be very difficult to compete next year,"" Xavi added on the position to Mundo. The potential arrival of Kimmich could spell difficulty for De Jong in terms of minutes at Barcelona, and would leave another hole in Bayern's midfield that they would look to fill. Ten Hag and United, dependent on De Jong's availability, are not expected to be far away from any deal for De Jong if a potential departure becomes a reality. Sources have indicated to 90min recently that the former Ajax midfield remains a player that Ten Hag ""adores"" and in an ideal world, he would still be the perfect midfielder for his project at Old Trafford. United have made three offers to Chelsea for Mason Mount and have pressed ahead with other players having failed in their attempts to sign De Jong last year. The club's takeover process - which has lasted seven months and counting - is not yet resolved, and has unquestionably hampered United's transfer activity so far this summer, much to the frustration of Ten Hag behind the scenes."

Adrien Rabiot confirms decision on Juventus future amid Man Utd interest,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/adrien-rabiot-confirms-decision-juventus-future-man-utd-interest,"The France international was first courted by the Red Devils last summer, but they could not reach an agreement on personal terms and he ended up staying at the Allianz Stadium. Rabiot then had his best season in a Bianconeri shirt to date, proving to be one of their more reliable performers in a campaign which was rocked by allegations of the club's financial mismanagement. His contract was due to expire at the end of June and Man Utd's interest was still lingering, with Juve in the dark until recently over his decision. feed But Rabiot has now put pen to paper on a new one-year contract in Turin. In a statement, Juventus said: ""Adrien renews until 30 June 2024 and is ready to experience more emotions with the black and white shirt. 177 appearances, 17 goals scored and three trophies won (a Scudetto, an Italian Cup and an Italian Super Cup): this is the loot accumulated up to now, destined to be enriched again. ""The story is not finished, we still have roads to go side by side and we are ready to continue running together towards our goals. Congratulations, Adrien!"""
West Ham could face battle to keep Lucas Paqueta,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-could-face-battle-to-keep-lucas-paqueta,"The 25-year-old was named in UEFA's Europa Conference League team of the tournament after helping to end West Ham's 43-year wait for a major trophy in early June. The Brazilian set up Jarrod Bowen's stoppage-time winner against Fiorentina, sparking wild celebrations in Prague as the Hammers won the game 2-1. Paqueta became West Ham's record signing last summer, moving to the club from Lyon in a deal worth Â£50m with additional add-ons, and has established himself as a firm fans' favourite after growing in stature during the 2022/23 season. The Brazilian needed some time to adjust to pace of the Premier League but turned in a number of impressive performance during the second half of the campaign, playing a pivotal role as West Ham not only warded off the threat of relegation but also steamrolled to unexpected European success. West Ham will play in next season's Europa League as a result, though their preparations for the new season have been rocked by Arsenal and Manchester City's very public pursuit of Declan Rice. The 24-year-old is expected to leave London Stadium this summer to further his career ambitions, but the club's Â£100m asking price is yet to be met despite a number of bids being made. And West Ham may have another problem on their hands if Ligue 1 giants PSG decide to follow up on their interest in Paqueta. Sources have confirmed to 90min that the former Champions League finalists are keeping tabs on his situation, knowing the player has recently changed representatives. feed 90min has learned that Paqueta wasn't overly enthused by West Ham's performances in the Premier League last season, which saw the club lose 20 of the 38 games they played to finish 14th. There are also concerns within Paqueta's camp over whether David Moyes' style suits his game and plays to his strengths - the Scot often asks his defensive line to sit deep and absorb pressure before looking to hit opposition teams on the counter. Paqueta's change of agent doesn't necessarily point to a desire to leave the club, but certainly raises eyebrows over whether he's considering his long-term future in east London. He remains a regular starter in the Brazil national team and was previously a target for Arsenal and Newcastle prior to joining West Ham. West Ham are unlikely to entertain any bids that come in for Paqueta, with their focus firmly on replacing Rice in the centre of midfield. Fulham's Joao Palhinha and Manchester City's Kalvin Phillips are two players firmly on the club's radar, while there's also interest in former Chelsea loanee Denis Zakaria and a long-term admiration for Everton's Amadou Onana. A number of other midfield options both at home and abroad are also being considered."
Sadio Mane makes decision on Saudi Pro League transfer,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/sadio-mane-decision-saudi-pro-league-transfer,"Mane traded Liverpool for Bayern last summer and endured a troubling campaign as he struggled for form and ended up getting suspended by the club in April after a bust-up with Leroy Sane. The Senegal international was often used in a central role to compensate for the sale of Robert Lewandowski to Barcelona, but managed only seven Bundesliga goals, missed a chunk of the season with a leg injury and didn't start any of the final three league games as Bayern snatched the title. Mane could be forgiven for wanting a swift exit and a fresh start elsewhere, but he won't be following Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and former Liverpool teammate Roberto Firmino to Saudi Arabia. feed The 31-year-old had been a target for the Saudi Pro League as it seeks to rival European football's established elite by poaching high profile names - albeit predominantly ageing ones. However, 90min understands that Mane is not even engaging with proposed talks and has no ambition to move to Saudi Arabia at this time. Bayern are hoping to recruit at the top end of the pitch going into 2023/24. The 11-time back-to-back Bundesliga champions have shown interest in France international Randal Kolo Muani, but have made an offer totalling â¬70m for Tottenham striker Harry Kane - although Spurs have denied receiving it and are adamant that such a bid would be rejected anyway. Landing a new 'number nine' could actually be a boost for Mane if it means being able to more consistently play in his favoured position wide on the left."
Roberto Firmino agrees Saudi Pro League deal,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/roberto-firmino-agrees-saudi-pro-league-deal,"Firmino departed Liverpool after eight years and six major trophies at the end of the 2022/23 season, with his contract due to expire this month. The Brazilian, who scored 111 goals in 362 appearances and has been hailed for his impact by both Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane in recent days, explained his decision to move on was motivated by the âcycleâ coming to an end and it feeling the right time to do so. Jurgen Klopp had wanted Firmino to stay at Anfield, declaring in January: ""I want to keep him"". The Liverpool boss later admitted his 'surprise' when the forward communicated he was ready to leave. 90min understands that Firmino will now be one of the next big names to take his career to the Saudi Pro League, following in the footsteps of Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and NâGolo Kante. feed The 31-year-old has agreed terms on a three-year contract that will take him to within a few months of his 35th birthday in 2026. He is set to join Al-Ahli, one of the league's four leading clubs controlled by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), who also own a controlling stake in Newcastle. Al-Ahli are keen to announce his arrival as soon as possible, potentially this week, having also agreed to sign goalkeeper Edouard Mendy from Chelsea. Al-Ahli lifted their most recent Saudi Pro League title in 2016 and have been regular runners-up. They are the last of the big four teams to land an international superstar, having seen Al-Ittihad sign the aforementioned Benzema and Kante, Al-Nassr take Ronaldo and soon Hakim Ziyech, with Al-Hilal getting Ruben Neves and Kalidou Koulibaly."
Tottenham deny receiving Harry Kane bid from Bayern Munich,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-opening-bid-harry-kane,"Bayern ended up not directly replacing Robert Lewandowski last summer when he was sold to Barcelona and have continued to keep tabs on Kane, who is about to enter the 12 months of the six-year contract he signed back in June 2018. 90min understands that Real Madrid are keeping an eye on Kaneâs situation, having seen Karim Benzema opt to join Al Ittihad in the Saudi Pro League. Manchester United are also interested in the striker but have backed away from anything formal in the belief that Spurs will refuse to sell. Paris Saint-Germain have additionally shown interest, with Spurs also expecting attention to come from big-spending fierce London rivals Chelsea. feed Bayern are the first club to put forward a bid for Kane, who turns 30 next month. 90min understands it is a Â£60m (â¬70m) package that includes add-ons, although Spurs have denied receiving a bid and are adamant any such offer would be rejected anyway. Crucially, from their perspective, chairman Daniel Levy does not want to sell and remains convinced he can persuade Kane to stay. Indeed, the belief across Europe in recent months has been that Kane wonât be sold this summer, although Bayern are at least testing the waters with regard to that theory. Kane has been informed that Spurs arenât prepared to entertain bids, despite being no closer to agreeing a new contract. But there remains a belief at the club that he could sign a fresh deal. Kane was back to his best for Tottenham in 2022/23, scoring 30 Premier League goals to equal his best ever league haul, with only a record-breaking campaign from Manchester Cityâs Erling Haaland denying the England captain a record-equalling fourth Golden Boot."
Arsenal close to Jurrien Timber deal after Ajax lower asking price,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-close-jurrien-timber-deal-ajax-lower-asking-price,"The Gunners have made the Netherlands international one of their top targets for the summer transfer window. They view Timber, a right-footed centre-back that has played all across the backline and in midfield in the past, as a potential parallel to Oleksandr Zinchenko, who begins matches at left-back but tucks in centrally higher up the pitch. 90min reported last week that Arsenal had made an opening â¬35m offer for Timber, but this fell well short of Ajax's â¬60m asking price. Despite this large gap in valuations, the Gunners remained confident that they would come to an agreement with Ajax. And 90min understands that the Dutch side have dropped their asking price down to â¬50m, which is close to Arsenal's new bid worth â¬48m. feed Personal terms have already been agreed with Timber and there is growing expectation that a transfer could be finalised before the weekend. He was previously a target for Manchester United, who are managed by former Ajax boss Erik ten Hag. The Red Devils pursued a transfer for the defender last summer but couldn't get a deal over the line, instead focusing on the signing of Lisandro Martinez. Timber is in line to become Arsenal's second signing of the summer, following on from Kai Havertz, whose move across London from Chelsea is imminent. Arsenal are also expected to make a new offer for Declan Rice after West Ham knocked back their first two bids. Manchester City have similarly had an approach turned down."
Why a Takesufa Kubo transfer could be worth â¬30m to Real Madrid,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/takesufa-kubo-transfer-could-be-worth-30m-real-madrid,"Los Blancos looked to have pulled off the ultimate coup when they brought Kubo back to Spain in 2019, four years after he had been forced to leave Barcelonaâs youth ranks over a breach of FIFAâs regulations on signing minors. Yet a string of loans to Mallorca, Villarreal, Getafe and Mallorca again failed to translate into a first-team opportunity with Real, having also fallen foul of La Ligaâs cap on non-EU players, and he left in 2022 without making a senior appearance. Real Sociedad were the beneficiaries of that, showing face in Kubo and watching him flourish. He was a regular starter for the club in both La Liga and the Europa League, finishing the season with 44 appearances in all competitions, nine goals â all of which came in La Liga, and nine assists. feed As a team, La Real had an outstanding season and finished fourth in the final standings to book a place in the Champions League for the first time in 10 years. It was first-hand evidence that Kubo could play an important role in a competitive team near the top of the table. His performances for La Real have unsurprisingly led to rumours of a possible transfer. Napoli are one such club reported by Italian media to be interested, having already experienced success in recent years with wingers like Hirving Lozano and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. When Kubo joined La Real, the mandatory release clause in his contract was set at â¬60m. SPORT has reported that the Basque club do not intend to settle for anything less should offers come in, the reason being that Real Madrid hold a sell-on clause worth 50%. Given that half of they could receive in a Kubo transfer contractually has to be passed on, it is logical for La Real to demand the highest possible price. But if they do manage to sell for the full â¬60m, it could be a big boost for those in Madrid, with â¬30m a substantial boost to the budget after losing Karim Benzema, Marco Asensio and Mariano Diaz as free agents, and releasing Eden Hazard."
Ange Postecoglou pushing for Tottenham to complete James Maddison deal,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ange-postecoglou-pushing-tottenham-complete-james-maddison-deal,"Spurs are hoping to bring in several new players this transfer window. Dejan Kulusevski has completed a permanent move from Juventus following his initial loan spell, while goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario is on the verge of joining from Empoli. Next up on their agenda is Maddison, who has one year left to run on his contract at Leicester City. The Foxes were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 2022/23 season and had set a Â£60m price tag on the England international. However, 90min understands that Leicester are willing to slightly lower this figure, while Tottenham are set to make a firm offer of Â£40m plus add-ons. feed Spurs' squad is currently without a player of Maddison's creative and technical profile, which is a problem they are trying to address given new head coach Postecoglou's desire to play a possession-based brand of football. Sources have confirmed to 90min that the Australian had hoped Maddison was going to be their first signing of the summer, with Tottenham working hard to now find an agreement with Leicester and personal terms expected to be thrashed out with relative ease. Maddison has been a long-term target for Tottenham, dating back to his days as a Coventry City player in the mid-2010s. Newcastle United are also interested in Maddison but as of yet have not made a concrete bid of their own. The Magpies are closing in on the blockbuster signing of Sandro Tonali, while they are in talks with Southampton over full-back Tino Livramento."

West Ham reject Manchester City bid for Declan Rice,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-reject-manchester-city-bid-declan-rice,"The Premier League champions formalised their interest in the 24-year-old with a bid on Monday night, comprised of Â£80m in guaranteed money and Â£10m in achievable performance related add-ons. City's bid was the same value as Arsenal's second offer for Rice which was rejected by West Ham last week. The Gunners had offered Â£75m up front and Â£15m in add-ons but had proposed to structure the payments over a number of years. West Ham have been steadfast in their Â£100m valuation of Rice, who they have accepted wants to move on and compete in the Champions League, and 90min understands that City's bid was swiftly rejected. The Hammers also hope the offer will now spark a bidding war between interested parties. feed Arsenal are expected to return to the negotiating with a third offer and are acutely aware that West Ham have been left frustrated by the bids they have received so far. Nevertheless, Rice remains their number one transfer target and is known to have a friendly relationship with manager Mikel Arteta. Manchester United also hold a significant interest in Rice and are considering whether or not to make a bid. Neighbourhood rivals City, meanwhile, likely see the West Ham captain as a quality replacement for Ilkay Gundogan, who joined Barcelona on a free transfer on Monday after seven hugely successful seasons at the Etihad Stadium, and could return with an improved offer.

Newcastle hold talks with Southampton over Tino Livramento,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/newcastle-hold-talks-southampton-tino-livramento,"Newcastle are wasted little time in pursuing midfield and attacking options this transfer window, with Milan's Sandro Tonali set to sign and talks ongoing with Leicester over James Maddison. But defensive reinforcements have always been high on their agenda. They want a new right-sided centre-half to compete with Fabian Schar, while another full-back is wanted as well. A left-back was ideally the target but Newcastle are now looking at players who can fill in on either side. 90min understands that has led them to Southampton, where talks have taken place over both Kyle Walker-Peters and Tino Livramento. Both are on the market following the Saints' relegation from the Premier League, but it is understood that Newcastle are pushing harder for 20-year-old Livramento. Newcastle are believed to have entered talks valuing him at around Â£15m, but sources have told 90min that Southampton are looking at closer to Â£30m for the former Chelsea man. feed In terms of centre-backs, 90min understandsÂ that Newcastle are looking closely at Crystal Palace pair MarcÂ Guehi and Joachim Andersen. England international Guehi has shone for Palace since joining from Chelsea, although an asking price of over Â£50m means a deal this summer for Newcastle looks tough given the number of positions they are looking to improve upon. Andersenâs price tag is more likely to be less than Â£30m and it is believed he is a more realistic target for Newcastle at this stage, although the Magpies are still looking at numerous options."
Manchester City table bid for West Ham captain Declan Rice,"Jun 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/manchester-city-bid-west-ham-captain-declan-rice,"The Premier League champions have been preparing to rival Arsenal for Rice, who recently followed in the footsteps of West Ham legends Bobby Moore and Billy Bonds to end the club's 43-year wait for a major trophy.

Transfer notebook: Roy Hodgson agrees Crystal Palace stay,"Jun 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/transfer-notebook-roy-hodgson-agrees-crystal-palace-stay,"Hodgson, who took charge of 162 games in his first spell as Palace manager from 2017 to 2021, returned to Selhurst Park in March after Patrick Vieira was dismissed from his post.

However, 90min has also learned that there may be a middle ground between the existing proposals for the two parties to strike a deal, despite the current Â£10m gap in valuations. Chelsea would be expected to close the transfer if United hit a figure of Â£60m with a new offer, 90min understands, which is below their latest counter proposal and just Â£5m above United's most recent bid. It's understood that if United are to hit that figure, the Blues are likely to close the transfer. Mount has indicated his preferred destination is United if he leaves Chelsea. United have however shown no willingness at this point to increase their offer, insisting that their rejected Â£55m bid was their final approach as it was made. United have cited that they feel Chelsea are adding a ""United tax"" to the deal, as the club have shown a habit in the past of caving in to sellers for a number of players they've signed. Chelsea bought Raheem Sterling last summer for around Â£47.5m and are on the verge of selling Mateo Kovacic for Â£25m plus Â£5m in add-ons to Manchester City. Both players were in the final year of their respective contracts on moving and United feel Chelsea's current valuation of Mount in context is unreasonable, given his deal is up in a year's time. manual Mount's age (24) and homegrown status however, combined with Chelsea's sales of Kovacic, Kai Havertz to Arsenal and a number of squad players to teams in Saudi Arabia has alleviated their position in respect to Financial Fair Play. Chelsea are keen to raise money by Friday this week to attach to their books from this season. They are, however, willing sellers given Mount's request to leave, and feel a deal totalling Â£60m would be acceptable if United come back to the table. Despite the impasse in negotiations at the moment, the feeling is that the deal will eventually be concluded. If it isn't, Mount could be reintegrated into the Chelsea first team fold under new manager Mauricio Pochettino and the Blues are expected to continue attempting to secure a contract extension. United's interest in Moises Caicedo has been made known but 90min understands a deal will be challenging at best, as Brighton value him in a similar bracket to Declan Rice - who could leave West Ham in the coming weeks for a fee of Â£100m or more. Caicedo is contracted until 2028 and younger than Rice, who United also hold interest in but are unable to stretch to do a deal for without adding players in exchange. United have issues with their current budget, but are also looking to sign a new first choice striker and may need to sign a new goalkeeper to replace David de Gea, who is out of contract on Friday. The uncertainty over the club's ownership is only adding to the early difficulty with their summer transfer plans. A contract has been offered by United to Juventus' Adrien Rabiot, who also sees his deal expire on June 30. The Frenchman is currently weighing up an offer from the Italian side but United have made their interest known over a number of months. The player will make a decision on his next move in the coming days."
Brighton hold talks with representatives of Man Utd target,"Jun 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/brighton-hold-talks-man-utd-target,"Kudu scored three goals in the Champions League group stage, including against Liverpool, during the first half of 2022/23 and then went on to impress at the 2022 World Cup with Ghana. During the tournament, 90min reported that Arsenal, Tottenham and Newcastle all made enquiries, with Liverpool already aware of his ability and Everton retaining interest after failing to get a proposed Â£15m deal over the line last summer. Borussia Dortmund, PSG, Lyon, Napoli and Atletico Madrid were also keeping tabs on the playerâs progress in Qatar. United began exploring a possible transfer for the versatile attacking player in January when they were trying to source a replacement for Cristiano Ronaldo. Ultimately, however, the Old Trafford preferred a cheaper option at that time and recruited Wout Weghorst on loan. feed But Erik ten Hag remains keen on a new forward and has already worked extensively with Kudus, who has operated as a number 10, number nine and on the right flank for Ajax this past season, owing to two years already spent together in Amsterdam. 90min understands that United remain keen on Kudus now and donât view the 22-year-old as an alternative to Mason Mount, for whom three bids have been rejected by Chelsea, given that their interest in the Ghanaian dates back a number of months already. But there will be increased competition for his signature. Brighton are not only interested, but have also established contact with the playerâs representatives and held early talks. The Seagulls finished sixth in the Premier League in 2022/23 to qualify for the Europa League and have earned a reputation in recent seasons for developing talented players, with Alexis Mac Allister the most notable success story following a transfer to Liverpool that could rise to Â£55m."
Arsenal tell Folarin Balogun to step up search for new club,"Jun 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-tell-folarin-balogun-search-new-club,"The 21-year-old, who recently switched his international allegiance from England to the United States of America, spent the 2022/23 season on loan at Stade Reims, and enjoyed a fruitful spell as he scored 21 goals in 37 Ligue 1 appearances. Only Kylian Mbappe, Alexandre Lacazette and Jonathan David had a better scoring record in France's top flight than Balogun last season, so there were high hopes for the younster returning to Arsenal and getting a chance to impress under Mikel Arteta. ""What I can say is that I definitely won't go on loan again,"" Balogun recently stressed about his future. ""I'm not sure [about] the discussions that are going to take place, I'm not sure what's going to happen."" But rather than Balogun being given a route into Arsenal's first team, a permanent departure from the Emirates Stadium appears to be the most likely scenario at present. feed Sources have confirmed to 90min that Balogun has again rejected the opportunity to renew his contract at Arsenal, while reiterating that he has no intention to be farmed out on loan - something the club had been considering given they have Gabriel Jesus and Eddie Nketiah ahead of him in the pecking order, as well as Kai Havertz also on his way in from Chelsea. Arsenal have told Balogun's representatives to begin work on finding a new club, with an alternative resolution not looking likely at this stage. Crystal Palace, West Ham, Brentford, Fulham and Everton are among the clubs to have made contact, 90min further understands, and several sides on the continent have also expressed an interest in a player Arsenal value at over Â£30m. Lille, another Ligue 1 outfit, are understood to be monitoring Balogun's situation while the future of star striker Jonathan David remains unclear, while RB Leipzig are also considering their options should a move for Lens' Lois Openda not progress as hoped."
RB Leipzig make Josko Gvardiol transfer fee demand clear to Man City,"Jun 30, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/rb-leipzig-josko-gvardiol-transfer-fee-demand-man-city,"City have long regarded Gvardiol as one of their top summer targets - already revealed by 90min in April - and now they are pushing on with talks for the Croatian star. Sources have confirmed to 90min talks between Gvardiol's representatives and City have gone well and personal terms are agreed 'in principle' leading to confidence that a deal will soon happen. Negotiations between the two clubs are now ongoing, with Leipzig seeking a sum that surpasses the Â£80m that Manchester United paid Leicester for Harry Maguire in 2019 - the current world record transfer for a defender. feed Although City are keen not to go as high as the â¬100m (Â£85.5m) Leipzig are looking for, they do recognise that a world record bid is likely required to get the deal done. With a deal already in place for Chelsea midfielder Mateo Kovacic, City are hoping to make Gvardiol their second Croatian signing of the summer as they unite the international colleagues. The Premier League and newly crowned European champions are looking to make room for Gvardiol in their squad next season with the sale of Spain international Aymeric Laporte, who is attracting interest from a number of the Premier League clubs including Aston Villa and Tottenham."
Barcelona complete signing of Man City captain Ilkay Gundogan,"Jun 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-complete-signing-man-city-ilkay-gundogan,"The 32-year-old's deal at Camp Nou includes the option to extend for a further 12 months, bringing to an end a hugely successful seven-year stay at the Etihad Stadium. Gundogan was a hugely influential figure last season as City ended their long wait for a first Champions League crown, and he also played a significant role as the club overhauled long-time leaders Arsenal in the Premier League title race. The German's influence didn't stop there, with a brace of goals at Wembley helping City overcome neighbourhood rivals Manchester United 2-1 to win the FA Cup  - the first goal a superb volley from outside the area in what was the fastest ever goal in a final. Gundogan was out of contract at the Etihad this summer and despite Pep Guardiola's desire for him to stay, he has opted to head to La Liga for a new challenge. âFor me it has been a total privilege and pleasure to be part of Manchester City for the last seven years,âÂ Gundogan told City's official website upon confirmation of his exit. âManchester has been my home and I have felt part of a very special family at City. âI have been lucky to have experienced so many unforgettable moments in my time here and to have been captain for this extra special season has been the greatest experience of my career. manual âFirst, I would like to thank Pep. To have been able to play under and learn from him for so long has been something I will never forget. I would also like to thank all my team-mates â past and present â who have all played such a special part in making my time here so amazing. âFinally, I would like to thank the incredible City fans. They have supported me from the moment I arrived, and I owe them all so much for their support. âThis club made me realise all my dreams and I will forever be thankful for this opportunity. âI will carry City always in my heart. Once a blue, always a blue.â Gundogan made 304 appearances for City in all competitions, scoring 60 goals from midfield. He won the Premier League title five times, the FA Cup twice, the Carabao Cup four times, the Community Shield twice and, perhaps most importantly, the Champions League. He'll now slot into a Barcelona midfield that includes the likes of Pedri, Frenkie de Jong and Gavi, with Xavi's side now primed to push for Champions League glory after romping to last season's La Liga title ahead of rivals Real Madrid."

The transfer is expected to be finalised in the next few days, and Jorginho - who made the same journey from Stamford Bridge to the Emirates Stadium back in January - has stirred the pot with a cryptic post on social media. Jorginho and Havertz are among a number of Chelsea players past and present who are at the wedding of Kepa Arrizabalaga, with the likes of Manchester City-bound Mateo Kovacic and Barcelona's Andreas Christensen also guests. But Jorginho notably took the time to take a selfie with Havertz alone, posting it to his Instagram story alongside laughing face and eye emojis. â³ðð¸ (@jorginhofrello/IG) pic.twitter.com/hnWbOta0F5 90min reported earlier this summer that Havertz was a target for Real Madrid following Karim Benzema's sudden departure to Al Ittihad, but they were ultimately put off by Chelsea's asking price. Bayern Munich then showed a willingness to step up their interest in a player they have long admired, but Havertz is now set to join Arsenal instead. Havertz will leave Chelsea best remembered for scoring the winner in the 2021 UEFA Champions League final, but underwhelming for the most part across his three-year spell. He notched 32 goals in 139 games for the Blues, playing as a centre forward for the majority of his time at Stamford Bridge. feed"
How Chelsea could line up with Nicolas Jackson,"Jun 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/how-chelsea-could-line-up-with-nicolas-jackson,"Andriy Shevchenko. Fernando Torres. Romelu Lukaku. Alvaro Morata. Gonzalo Higuain. Timo Werner. Romelu Lukaku again. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Perhaps the relative obscurity of Nicolas Jackson, coming off the back of a fine breakout season at Villarreal, could help lower expectations upon arrival at Stamford Bridge. Hey, Chelsea don't have a lot left to lose at this point. So while the rest of the world tries to come up with chants to the tune of Ms Jackson by Outkast, we've devised some ways in which Mauricio Pochettino could use his new striker. feed Chelsea's striking options heading into the new season are looking a little thin, even though they're paradoxically numerous. Kai Havertz is joining Arsenal. Lukaku wants to go back to Inter. Aubameyang could very well leave. Armando Broja is coming off a serious injury. Christopher Nkunku isn't really a number nine. David Datro Fofana is likely to leave on loan. There's a good chance for Jackson to come straight into pre-season and impress Pochettino, to stake an early claim to start up front alone in the Argentine's preferred 4-2-3-1 formation. Madueke - Nkunku - Sterling - Jackson Madueke - Nkunku - Mudryk - Jackson Nkunku - Mount - Sterling - Jackson Though Pochettino is likely to play a 4-2-3-1 - both because that's how best to utilise his pressing tactics and Chelsea's squad lends itself nicely to the system - he has deviated from his norm to play two strikers together. In his later days at Tottenham, he pushed Son Heung-min up alongside Harry Kane to essentially do his pressing and running for him, while Spurs also switched to a 3-5-2 when starting as a 3-4-3 on occasion. If Pochettino is able to put his arm around the likes of Aubameyang and Lukaku to get them to buy into Chelsea's new project, they could make ideal partners for Jackson. Aubameyang - Jackson Lukaku - Jackson Broja - Jackson We've already mentioned Nkunku as a number ten behind Jackson and the possibility of the Senegal international playing with a partner, but this is an option which deserves a standalone category. Nkunku is the perfect modern-day shadow striker, and Pochettino famously oversaw the development of Dele Alli when he was more befitting of that title at a young age. Could Nkunku and Jackson be the new Dele and Kane? Probably not, but they could make a fine tribute act. Nkunku - Jackson"
Kalidou Koulibaly completes move to Al Hilal from Chelsea,"Jun 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/kalidou-koulibaly-completes-move-to-al-hilal-from-chelsea,"The Senegal defender has put pen to paper on a lucrative deal in the Middle East, bringing the curtain down on a short stay in England. He becomes Al Hilal's second high-profile signing this month after they added Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves to their ranks. Al Hilal had hoped to bring in Lionel Messi but he has instead opted to head to MLS side Inter Miami. Koulibaly signed for Chelsea during the summer 2022 transfer window, widely seen as their successor to Antonio Rudiger after he joined Real Madrid. He quickly endeared himself to fans with a superb volley to open the scoring in a 2-2 draw with rivals Tottenham on the second weekend of the 2022/23 season. Injuries limited Koulibaly to only 23 Premier League games in his only campaign in England. manual In a statement, Chelsea said: ""We would like to thank Kalidou for his contributions on and off the pitch during his time at Stamford Bridge and wish him well for the next stage of his career."" Koulibaly is the first of at least three Chelsea players heading to Saudi Arabia this summer. Edouard Mendy and Hakim Ziyech are expected to complete transfers to Al Ahli and Al Nassr respectively in the next few days, though Romelu Lukaku has turned down an approach to join the Saudi Pro League."

Mikel Arteta speaks out on Arsenal's interest in Declan Rice & Kai Havertz,"Jun 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/mikel-arteta-speaks-arsenal-interest-declan-rice-kai-havertz,"West Ham have already knocked back two bids from Arsenal for Rice, who they value at over Â£100m. The Gunners' latest offer, a package worth Â£90m, was rejected and Arsenal now face pressure from Manchester City to get a deal done. Speaking to Marca, Arteta was first asked about Rice and, given the current status of Arsenal's pursuit of the midfielder, remained predictably tight-lipped. ""I can't talk about players who are not in the club. I prefer not to say anything,"" he said. Arsenal's pursuit of Havertz is far calmer, however, with a fee of Â£65m agreed to lure the Germany international over from Chelsea, and that was reflected in the freedom with which Arteta discussed this second move. feed ""Talent comes at a price, and at Arsenal we are always interested in youngsters with experience,"" Arteta continued.  ""I repeat, I'm not talking about players from other clubs, but in the case of Kai he has already shown a lot, including [winning] a Champions League. He is a talented player, versatile and only 24 years old."" Spending money to rejuvenate the squad has been key for Arteta, who has overseen the drastic lowering of Arsenal's average age. ""We have already regenerated the squad, with a very young average and to generate performance and value,"" he explained. ""We have some owners aligned with us: build a winning team that is sustained over time, without so much investment.  ""But the demand is increasing and you have to go to the market to find what we don't have to continue improving."""
Barcelona target's price tag confirmed by club president,"Jun 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-target-price-tag-confirmed-club-president,"Diaz has excelled in Uruguay with Liverpool Montevideo and recently played a starring role in his country's run to glory at the Under-20 World Cup, with his performances attracting plenty of interest from across Europe. Barcelona have been touted as potential suitors as Xavi is on the lookout for another midfielder to replace Sergio Busquets, with Diaz seen as a potential star of both the present and future. If BarÃ§a are to pursue a deal for Diaz, they will need to meet the â¬8m asking price which was laid out by Liverpool Montevideo president Jose Luis Palma. ""[Diaz's] price is â¬8m,"" Palma revealed. ""It is likely that he will be sold in August."" feed Having seen their feasibility plan approved by La Liga, Barcelona have begun chasing their transfer targets and have already struck an agreement to land Ilkay Gundogan on a free transfer after his Manchester City contract expired. Gundogan will likely play in a more advanced role, however, leaving Xavi needing a new face to replace Busquets. 90min understands there is interest in Inter midfielder Marcelo Brozovic but Barcelona are facing serious pressure from Saudi Arabia's Al Nassr, who are capable of offering the sort of money no longer available at Camp Nou. Barcelona have asked Brozovic's representatives for more time to put together a formal offer, whereas Al Nassr are pushing to complete a move immediately."
Man Utd remain in Mason Mount talks despite third rejected bid,"Jun 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-remain-mason-mount-talks-third-rejected-bid,"United saw their latest offer of Â£50m plus Â£5m in add-ons rejected by Chelsea on Friday and had previously threatened to walk away if their bid was not accepted, with club officials thought to be wary of another prolonged transfer saga. However, sources have confirmed to 90min lines of communication remain open between the two sides, whose valuations of Mount are close but, crucially, fall on opposite sides of the Â£60m mark. United are adamant they will not pay over the odds for Mount and believe Chelsea's demands are unreasonable for a player who has just one year remaining on his contract. On the other side of the table, Chelsea have dropped their Â£70m asking price and countered United's offer with a proposal of Â£58m plus a further Â£7m - a Â£65m package in total. feed The two sides are currently Â£10m apart in valuation and neither is currently showing signs of budging, but United believe a deal can still be agreed and have not yet turned away. However, with an agreement far from certain at this point, United are exploring possible alternatives and are known admirers of Juventus' Adrien Rabiot. The Frenchman is available on a free transfer this summer but could still end up staying in Turin, although a number of sides are thought to be keen to lure him away. Chelsea are prepared to cash in on Mount, whose sale would clearly go a long way to help balance their books, but only for the right price. The Blues have seen their finances strengthened already this month after agreeing deals to part ways with a number of first-team players. Kai Havertz is on the cusp of a Â£65m move to Arsenal and Mateo Kovacic will soon join Manchester City for up to Â£30m, while Kalidou Koulibaly, Edouard Mendy and Hakim Ziyech will all move to Saudi Arabia in the coming days for around Â£40m combined."

Every PIF signing in the 2023 summer transfer window,"Jul 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/every-pif-signing-2023-summer-transfer-window,"Elite level football has historically had its roots in Europe thanks to the dominance of the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A, but Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund means unrivalled sums of cash are being used to prise players away from Europe like Major League Soccer and the Chinese Super League did before. PIF is also the majority owner at Newcastle. The sovereign wealth fund is now pumping money into Al Ahli, Al Ittihad, Al Hilal and Al Nassr with the aim of attracting more star names to make the move and subsequently boost the international stature of the league. Given how quickly these clubs are moving, here's a look at the players who have already made the move to the Saudi Pro League following PIF's new control of Al Ahli, Al Ittihad, Al Hilal and Al Nassr. Certainly the biggest name to head to Saudi Arabia so far this summer, Karim Benzema is the profile of player you would expect to make this move. Now 35 years old, the former France international is within his rights to welcome a change of pace even if he still scored 31 goals in all competitions for Real Madrid last season. With his contract expiring, Benzema chose to join Al Ittihad on a three-year deal. The Frenchman is expected to earn a frightening Â£172m per year, whereas his Real terms netted him only Â£14.5m a year. Another big name who will be at Al Ittihad next season is N'Golo Kante. The French midfielder will join compatriot Benzema after leaving Chelsea. After speculation over his future, Kante chose Al Ittihad despite only being 31 and seemingly having more to achieve in Europe. Through the course of his four-year deal with the Saudi Pro League team Kante is expected to earn Â£21.5m per season. It's not exactly Benzema's level, but it's a big raise on the rough Â£15m Chelsea were paying him each year. If you're not a fan of these deals taking place, this is the most 'concerning' one.  Ruben Neves joined Al Hilal for a fee of around Â£45m and is comfortably in his prime at only 26 years old. Reports suggest Neves is set to be paid Â£300,000 a week in Saudi Arabia, which will not be taxed. An English side would need to pay him Â£600,000 if they were to match his take-home pay. There have been reports suggesting Neves could be loaned to Newcastle in the future, which would add more than a degree of seediness to the whole affair. Of course, 'PIF signings' does not just mean teams from the Saudi Pro League. Newcastle have swiped one of the best young midfielders in the world away from AC Milan after their bid of around â¬70m was accepted pretty quickly. There was a general feeling Tonali could have spent the rest of his career at Milan, but that will not be the case. His move suggests Newcastle are able to pluck players from anywhere now, even clubs with the history and stature of Milan. Once revered as one of the best defenders in Europe, Kalidou Koulibaly jumped ship from Napoli for his big-money move to Chelsea at the wrong time. Napoli won the Serie A title while the Blues came 12th in the Premier League. Al Hilal have swooped in, adding to their ranks with the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations winner. Edouard Mendy looked like one of the bargains of the century when he played a starring role in Chelsea's 2021 Champions League success. That triumph more than compensates for his dramatic loss of form since, with error-prone Kepa Arrizabalaga seen as the more secure bet for Mauricio Pochettino. Mendy has completed a move to Al Ahli. Marcelo Brozovic's last game for Inter ended up being the Champions League final defeat to Manchester City. The Croatia international has achieved plenty in the game, winning Serie A alongside some domestic trophies. Al Nassr have bolstered their squad which finished second last season by welcoming Brozovic to Riyadh. Roberto Firmino stuck it out during the tough early spells of his Liverpool career to become an all-time legend at Anfield. The Brazilian formed a wonderful partnership with Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane but was a victim of the Reds' need for a rebuild, not getting an extension on his contract. Al Ahli subsequently picked the forward up on a free transfer. Jota was name-dropped by Cristiano Ronaldo recently as an example of the Saudi Pro League's appeal due to his and compatriot Ruben Neves' relative youth. The former Portugal youth international spent two successful seasons with Celtic, often turning up on the biggest occasions, and will hope for more grandstand moments over in the Middle East. Lens finished second in Ligue 1 last season to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 2002/03, when they came third in a group containing AC Milan, Deportivo La Coruna and Bayern Munich. It wasn't enough to keep club captain Seko Fofana around, the midfielder departing for Al Nassr, though Lens have taken the step of making Fofana a stakeholder at the club in a show of respect. Perennially linked with Europe's top clubs - most frequently and laboriously Manchester United - Sergej Milinkovic-Savic has everything a dynamic midfielder needs to succeed at one of the biggest teams in the world. No move away from Lazio ever materialised and this summer he decided to leave Stadio Olimpico for Al Hilal, where he'll form a midfield partnership with fellow new arrival Neves. manual"
Best signings of the 2023/24 Premier League summer transfer window - ranked,"Jul 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/best-signings-2023-24-premier-league-ranked,"""All this transfer talk does my head in, there's nothing more dull than that,"" the former Napoli and Chelsea manager sniffed while in charge of Lazio. But based on the unrelenting churn of the rumour mill, it appears sulky Sarri is in the minority. The excitement of endless possibilities conjured during the transfer window outstrips the underwhelming reality of the regular season for many fans - only a handful of clubs harbour any realistic hopes of winning a trophy, and even fewer actually lift any silverware. However, every club has the chance to make a clever addition in the off-season. Here are some of the best snapped up by Premier League sides this summer. Kovacic won't bring anything Manchester City haven't seen before but with the departure of Ilkay Gundogan to Manchester City, Pep Guardiola needed a solid all-rounder to come in.City took advantage of Chelsea's summer fire sale by picking up Croatia international Kovacic, who won his fourth Champions League with the Blues having previously won three with Real Madrid.His injury record is a worry but Kovacic shouldn't have any issues gelling with the squad at the Etihad. Unai Emery has grand aspirations for Aston Villa and has been reunited with defender Pau Torres, who played under the former Arsenal manager at Villarreal.Torres joins Tyrone Mings, Ezri Konsa and Diego Carlos as centre back options for Villa but the Spain international's Â£31.5m arrival suggests he's nailed on for a starting berth.Torres knows what it takes to win in Europe as a Europa League winner in 2021 and will be targeting more continental success as Villa compete in the Europa Conference League. A few viral clips of Sandro Tonali visiting St James' Park and looking glum certainly shone a light at Newcastle's new-found pulling power over clubs like AC Milan.The Magpies' evolution is a little ahead of schedule with Champions League football on the menu for the first time since 2002/03 but with Italy international Tonali's arrival they have added another level of depth to midfield.He's not the finished article yet but his role in the Rossoneri's Serie A title win of 2021/22 shows Tonali may well live up to some early Andrea Pirlo comparisons. Mikel Arteta needed to add greater quality in depth to his Arsenal backline this summer and has done exactly that in drafting in former Ajax defender Jurrien Timber.The Netherlands international is capable of slotting in across the back four and won't get caught out by any high pressing thanks to his ease in possession.Timber was part of the Dutch squads for Euro 2020 and the 2022 World Cup and arrives with two Eredivisie titles in his cabinet. In what was the worst kept secret of the summer window so far - if there are any secrets these days - Mason Mount left boyhood club Chelsea for Premier League rivals Manchester United.The England international was a frequent presence in the starting XI when the Blues won the Champions League but became somewhat of a divisive figure at Stamford Bridge. He was a frequent goal threat, totting up 33 strikes in 195 competitive appearances.For a guaranteed Â£55m with Â£5m in potential add-ons, Man Utd have acquired a hard-working midfield who should be able to gel well with Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford. Fans throughout Europe have long tracked the progress of Dominik Szoboszlai, who first popped up as a youth prospect with Salzburg.Rubbing shoulders with the likes of Erling Haaland and Takumi Minamino in Austria and Christopher Nkunku, Emil Forsberg and Dani Olmo later at RB Leipzig, Szoboszlai enjoyed prolific partnerships in attack at both franchise clubs before Liverpool met his Â£60m release clause.The Hungary international has all the desirable characteristics of a Jurgen Klopp midfielder and all eyes are glued to see how well he settles at Anfield. James Maddison was one of the players plucked from the bargain bucket of relegated clubs, joining Tottenham from Leicester in a Â£40m deal.The attacking midfielder has the exact profile of playmaking Spurs have been lacking in recent seasons, bringing a threat from set pieces and a creative mindset not previously encouraged in north London.He may have to figure out how he and Harry Kane co-exist - if the striker remains at Tottenham - but the potential link-up play with Dejan Kulusevski and Son Heung-min is dreamy. Chelsea have been burned before when signing a Bundesliga forward on the back of a goal-laden season with a lofty reputation.However, Christopher Nkunku possesses a more well-rounded game than the speed-merchant Timo Werner and - at Â£51m - doesn't represent the same tier of financial investment as Kai Havertz. After the last game of Brighton's season, Roberto De Zerbi hailed Alexis Mac Allister as one of the team's 'big, big players' capable of playing 'in a big, big European team'. Liverpool snapped up the 24-year-old early in the window, ensuring that Mac Allister will have a full pre-season to get embedded into Klopp's team.With the experience of working under De Zerbi and Graham Potter on the south coast, Mac Allister is no stranger to demanding tactical briefs. The World Cup winner offers versatility, energy and end product.At an initial fee of just Â£35m, potentially rising to Â£55m in time, Mac Allister could even prove to be the bargain of the summer. Declan Rice's reputation is at an all-time high thanks to some heroic seasons with West Ham that culminated with victory in the Europa Conference League.It soon became apparent that it would be his final contribution as a Hammer as Arsenal and Manchester City entered a brief bidding war. The Gunners eventually saw off their rivals with an initial Â£100m deal that could rise by another Â£5m.Mikel Arteta identified the England international as a summer arrival and pushed for his arrival.

It started with Cristiano Ronaldo joining Al-Nassr at the start of January but has picked up considerably since the end of the 2022/23 season. Karim Benzema joined newly crowned Al-Ittihad from Real Madrid, followed by N'Golo Kante from Chelsea. Ruben Neves, 26, then bucked the trend of ageing players heading for a pre-retirement pay day when he completed a transfer from Wolves to Al-Hilal, the club that had targeted Lionel Messi.

Chelsea have been scouring the market for a new striker and had initially identified Napoli's Victor Osimhen as their top target, but it would take a nine-figure sum to pry him away from the newly-crowned champions of Italy this summer. feed Tottenham had also anticipated an approach from the Blues for Harry Kane once former Spurs boss Pochettino was sworn in at Chelsea, but it's increasingly likely that the England captain stays put this summer.

Meanwhile, Arsenal are expected to make Kai Havertz their first summer signing after agreeing a fee with Chelsea, while they will also make another bid for Declan Rice though face competition from Manchester City.

Busquets' arrival in Miami is a significant coup as they had to fight off competition from Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, who have Cristiano Ronaldo on their roster and have huge financial backing from the Public Investment Fund (PIF). ""I'm not going to deny [it and say] there isn't truth in the speculation that we're interested in Lionel Messi and Sergio Busquets,"" former head coach Phil Neville confirmed in March.

Barcelona and cash-rich Al Hilal had attempted to sign Messi ahead of Inter Miami, but the former was unable to provide the kind of guarantees Messi was looking for despite his strong affiliation with the club. Inter Miami's offer will not only pocket Messi between $50m and $60m-a-year over time but will also give him an ownership stake in the club, while no details have yet been provided on Busquets' agreement. 90min understands, however, that the 34-year-old will join on a Designated Player contract.Â "
Chelsea reject third Man Utd bid for Mason Mount,"Jun 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-reject-third-man-utd-bid-mason-mount,"The 24-year-old's contract at Stamford Bridge expires next summer and talks over an extension have failed to yield an agreement despite months of negotiations between the two parties.

Mount has already agreed personal terms in principle with United and is seen as a key signing for Ten Hag as the club prepare to return to the Champions League. The England international has made 195 appearances for Chelsea and scored 33 goals, lifting the Champions League in 2021 after a 1-0 win over Manchester City in the final.

Cesar Azpilicueta closing in on Inter move,"Jun 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/cesar-azpilicueta-closing-in-inter-move,"The fan-favourite has fallen down the pecking order since the emergence of Reece James and came close to leaving Chelsea last year amid interest from Barcelona, only to sign a new contract at Stamford Bridge. With January signing Malo Gusto set to arrive at Stamford Bridge this summer to provide more competition for James, Azpilicueta has been told he is free to leave Chelsea and sources have confirmed to 90min that he is closing in on a move to Inter. Azpilicueta, 33, has spoken with Bayern Munich and also received interest from Saudi Arabia but is set to take his talents to Inter, who have agreed the terms of a two-year contract with the right-back. Despite still having one year remaining on his deal at Chelsea, Azpilicueta is expected to be granted a free transfer as a sign of respect for his 11 years of service. feed Azpilicueta joined from Marseille in 2012 to very little fanfare but soon established himself as an integral part of Chelsea's defence, featuring on both the right and left and even transitioning into a centre-back later in his career. In total, Azpilicueta has racked up 508 outings for Chelsea, putting him sixth on the club's all-time appearance charts, and Blues officials are keen to reward that loyalty by granting him a free transfer. Chelsea and Inter have been locked in negotiations all summer over a range of issues. While the Blues have backed away from a deal for goalkeeper Andre Onana, talks remain ongoing over striker Romelu Lukaku. Lukaku spent last season on loan with Inter and is determined to return. Chelsea are pushing for a permanent sale but Inter can only afford a loan and so work is being done to try and thrash out an agreement which benefits everyone."

European Under-21 Championship stars and the clubs they could join this summer,"Jun 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/european-under-21-championship-stars-clubs-they-could-join,"They are always thrilling to watch as viewers get an early look at some of the stars of the future. Given how quickly many players are able to burst onto the scene these days, there will be a lot of very recognisable names at the Under-21 Euros in Romania and Georgia which got underway on June 21 and run until the final on July 8. More importantly, there will be a lot of players in action who are already being linked with moves to some very big clubs. 90min has the lowdown on every player on this list of 2023 U21 Euros stars to keep an eye on as the transfer market gets into full swing. manual Belgian attacker Lois Openda was one of the best players in Ligue 1 last season and came close to leading RC Lens to a shock league title at the expense of Paris Saint-Germain. Had the Parisien side had one more wobble, it could have been a different story. Openda got 21 league goals and four assists last season which is why the 23-year-old is being linked with a big move to either AC Milan or RB Leipzig. Premier League sides like Manchester United, Liverpool, Newcastle and more have all been to see him in action recently. Lens are demanding â¬50m given he has another four years left on his contract. He only joined them last summer from Club Brugge and will be one of the most confident players at the tournament. Certainly one of the biggest names in the summer transfer window so far, it will be amazing if Khephren Thuram is still a Nice player next season. The young French defensive midfielder has already shown he has so many elements of midfield play in his locker. One of them is stamina; he played an incredible 48 games this season for Nice across all competitions. The team he seems to be the most heavily linked with is Liverpool, which is a theme for midfielders on this list. The Premier League side have been in talks with Nice but he is one of many targets Jurgen Klopp has in midfield. Another midfield name that seems to be a serious target for Liverpool, Gabri Veiga was the shining light for Celta Vigo in 2022/23 in a really tough campaign. He's an exciting attacking midfielder who grabbed 11 La Liga goals and four assists despite being in a poor side. Chelsea and Barcelona have also been linked with Veiga and it seems very likely that there will be a lot of eyes on him at the U21 Euros. Almost every big club in Europe has been watching Veiga in the second half of the season. Levi Colwill could be one of the big movers in the Premier League this season. Many Chelsea fans have been baffled by the refusal to use him in the past, but they made the right call in loaning him to Brighton. He has flourished into one of the best ball-playing defenders in the Premier League. Brighton are now prepared to try and break their transfer record for the Chelsea man. Tottenham have also been linked with Colwill, who has told Chelsea he would like to leave if he is not going to be a firm part of the first team next season. OK, this is the final Liverpool-linked midfielder on the list. Ryan Gravenberch was in a similar position last year while still an Ajax player before moving to Bayern Munich. That seemed like the end of it, but he has not managed to find his form in Bavaria and has told the club he wants to leave if he does not get more game time. Liverpool were heavily linked last year, but they now feel they could get a cut-price deal for the Dutchman. That could be a loan with an optional fee, but either way, they will be watching him closely at the U21 Euros this summer. Arguably the player closest to actually making a move on this list, Sandro Tonali suddenly looks as though he will not be an AC Milan player next season. He took less money to join the team he supports, but it seems he and Milan cannot turn down the riches of Newcastle United. The two clubs have now come to an agreement for his sale and while Tonali is really key to Milan, he is not irreplaceable. The sad truth for Serie A is no club in the league can turn down a â¬70m bid for a player like Tonali, especially when there are cheaper replacements available.  There's a very good generation of players coming through in Georgia right now. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia is the headline maker, but Giorgi Mamardashvili has been superb in goal for Valencia and is part of the reason they avoided a shock relegation to the Segunda Division. He played 100% of the minutes in La Liga in 2022/23 and managed to keep seven clean sheets, hardly bad going for a goalkeeper in a team that finished the season in 16th, two points from the drop zone. He has been in talks with various Premier League clubs over the past few months, while Monaco, AC Milan and Atletico Madrid also hold an interest. "

The players with the highest combined transfer fees,"Jun 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/players-highest-combined-transfer-fees,"It's one thing to shine brightly enough to be bought for tens of millions of pounds, but it is arguably more impressive to consistently command eye-watering sums of money across multiple moves. We're going to look at the players who have had the most spent on them in transfer fees during their career. manual Obviously. Zlatan Ibrahimovic had to feature here and just three or four years ago he would be ranked much higher. The Swedish star, who recently retired, has played for many of the biggest clubs in the world. Naturally, that means he has moved more than average and the fees have been larger than average. Money has been paid for Ibrahimovic's services on seven different occasions, with the biggest fee being the â¬69.5m (plus Samuel Eto'o) Barcelona paid Inter for him in 2009. Transfer Date Fee Malmo to Ajax July 1, 2001 â¬7.8m Ajax to Juventus August 31, 2004 â¬16m Juventus to Inter August 10, 2006 â¬24.8m Inter to Barcelona July 27, 2009 â¬69.5m Barcelona to AC Milan August 28, 2010 â¬6m (loan fee) Barcelona to AC Milan July 1, 2011 â¬24m AC Milan to PSG July 18, 2012 â¬21m There was a time when it seemed Ousmane Dembele would light up European football for many years. Things have not quite panned out that way, mainly due to injuries, but he has still had some superb moments and there are plenty of years ahead of him.  Only two fees have ever been paid for Ousmane Dembele and one of them was absolutely massive. He joined Barcelona in 2017 for what was the second-biggest transfer fee ever paid at the time. Transfer Date Fee Stade Rennes to Borussia Dortmund July 1, 2016 â¬35m Borussia Dortmund to Barcelona August 25, 2017 â¬135m It is not quite to the same extent as Ibrahimovic, but Angel Di Maria has played for some very big clubs during his career. He has moved for a fee four times in his career, and three of them were very big at the time. Transfer Date Fee Rosario to Benfica July 27, 2007 â¬8m Benfica to Real Madrid July 1, 2010 â¬33m Real Madrid to Manchester United August 26, 2014 â¬75m Manchester United to PSG August 6, 2015 â¬63m This is a name that could well rise up the list in the future, although the idea of him leaving PSG for free in 2024 is very, very plausible now. Kylian Mbappe has only ever moved for one fee, but it was an absolute monster. If he goes for a price again, it could well be bigger depending on the circumstances. Transfer Date Fee Monaco to PSG July 1, 2018 â¬180m Mbappe's France teammate, Antoine Griezmann, has racked up the same figure, but he has moved more frequently than his junior compatriot. Griezmann has moved for money on three occasions, although that is set to become four at the end of June when he signs permanently for Atletico Madrid. Transfer Date Fee Real Sociedad to Atletico Madrid July 28, 2014 â¬30m Atletico Madrid to Barcelona July 14, 2019 â¬120m Barcelona to Atletico Madrid August 31, 2021 â¬10m (loan fee) Barcelona to Atletico Madrid July 1, 2023 â¬20m (upcoming) Philippe Coutinho has had a very odd career. Without reaching the heights predicted in his youth, the trigger-happy Brazilian has still achieved plenty. He has had money paid for him on five occasions, and one of them was the record sale of a Premier League player. He still has time to achieve more at his current home, Aston Villa. Transfer Date Fee Vasco U17 to Inter July 23, 2008 â¬3.8m Inter to Liverpool January 30, 2013 â¬13m Liverpool to Barcelona January 8, 2018 â¬135m Barcelona to Bayern Munich August 19, 2019 â¬8.5m (loan fee) Barcelona to Aston Villa July 1, 2022 â¬20m The hardest quiz question in football: Who does Alvaro Morata currently belong to?  The Spanish striker has been bouncing around a handful of big teams for years and to be fair, he has generally managed to score goals at every club he has played for. Money has been spent on him six times, and he is likely not far away from another move soon.

Liverpool agree to send Fabio Carvalho on loan to Bundesliga,"Jun 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-agree-fabio-carvalho-loan-bundesliga,"The 20-year-old joined from Fulham last summer and managed 21 appearances across all competitions during his first season at Anfield. He was a regular feature in the squad to start the season but was afforded just 11 minutes of Premier League action from November onwards. A loan move for this season has been on the cards for a while now but, as 90min revealed in April, the idea of a permanent departure was firmly ruled out. Sources have confirmed that Liverpool have rejected a permanent offer from Leipzig but have agreed to a straight loan deal which does not include an option or obligation to buy for the German side. Liverpool want Carvalho back at the club ahead of the 2024/25 campaign and have ensured they remain in control of the former Fulham starlet's future. feed Liverpool officials are understood to have been keen to keep Carvalho for the upcoming pre-season to give manager Jurgen Klopp chance to make a decision on his immediate future, but the 20-year-old wanted to get his future resolved as soon as possible and is now set to head to Germany for the coming year. Deployed both as a midfielder and a left winger under Klopp, Carvalho has seen Liverpool strengthen in both positions since his arrival. Cody Gakpo and Darwin Nunez have added to the competition out wide, while Alexis Mac Allister has agreed to move to Anfield this summer to bolster in midfield. The Reds remain keen to add another fresh face in midfield. Nice's Khephren Thuram and Borussia Monchengladbach's Manu Kone have both been discussed, and interest remains in unsettled Bayern Munich youngster Ryan Gravenberch."
Man Utd enter Andre Onana talks with David de Gea exit increasingly likely,"Jun 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-andre-onana-talks-david-de-gea-exit,"The Red Devils are continuing negotiations with the Spaniard over a new deal having previously been close to an agreement on fresh terms. De Gea turned down a lucrative move to Saudi Arabia earlier in June in order to thrash out the formalities of a new contract at Old Trafford, but he is more likely than ever to leave United at the end of the month. 90min reported on Tuesday that United were actively looking at the goalkeeper market as talks with De Gea rumbled on, with Porto's Diogo Costa and Brentford's David Raya among their targets. Another name on their radar was Onana, who worked under manager Erik ten Hag at Ajax, and sources have revealed to 90min that the club have held talks with the player's camp in recent days. United have also been in touch with Inter and have been informed that it would take a total fee of â¬60m to get him out of San Siro this transfer window - Chelsea had previously been in talks with Inter over Onana but were put off by the asking price. feed If United follow through with a move for Onana, it would represent a drastic change of their summer transfer plans. They had banked on De Gea staying and then signing a cheaper alternative to challenge him for the starting spot, but if the 32-year-old departs then they will be forced to splash out on a ready-made replacement. 90min previously revealed that United had hoped young goalkeeper Matej Kovar would provide the needed competition for De Gea following an impressive loan spell at Sparta Prague. Sources have told 90min that United watched Empoli goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario at points last season, but he is set to move to Premier League rivals Tottenham."

Hojlund, who has emerged as one of Man Utd's top striker targets this transfer window, has already informed Atalanta that he is looking to leave and he is set to get his wish. Aside from Man Utd, sources have told 90min that Inter, Napoli and Juventus have all registered an interest with Atalanta.

Man Utd hopeful of agreeing Mason Mount fee with Chelsea after third bid submitted,"Jun 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-hopeful-agreeing-mason-mount-fee-chelsea,"Mount is entering the final 12 months of his current contract at Stamford Bridge, and has declined contract extension offers from the club, thus opening the door to a potential move this summer. Sources have told 90min that the England international has agreed personal terms with Man Utd, and now the Red Devils are attempting to strike a deal with Chelsea in order to get the deal over the line. The Blues recently rejected an opening bid worth Â£40m and a follow up bid of Â£50m from Man Utd for the midfielder. Chelsea had initially demanded Â£70m for Mount, but sources have confirmed that they would be willing to accept a bid of Â£60m-Â£65m. feed 90min understands that a third bid has arrived worth an initial Â£50m plus a further Â£5m in add-ons, which still falls short of Chelsea's valuation. United believe this offer to be more than fair for a player in Mount's situation and have threatened to walk away from negotiations if this latest bid is rejected. Man Utd manager Erik ten Hag is a huge fan of the player and is pushing hard to get a deal finalised, seeing Mount as a key part of his plans at Old Trafford moving forward. "
Tottenham concerned by rival interest in Edmond Tapsoba,"Jun 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-concerned-rival-interest-edmond-tapsoba,"Spurs are on the hunt for at least one new centre-back in the summer transfer window following a disastrous Premier League campaign in which they conceded 63 goals - only Bournemouth, Nottingham Forest and the three relegated clubs had worse records. Among Tottenham's targets are Manchester United captain Harry Maguire, Manchester City's Aymeric Laporte and Wolves' Max Kilman. However, they are currently pursuing a deal for 24-year-old Tapsoba, who impressed Spurs scouts during previous visits to watch teammate Piero Hincapie. 90min understands Tapsoba's representatives have signalled he is willing to move to Tottenham and they are in talks with the club over a transfer, but Spurs are not the only team in the race. feed Liverpool, Manchester United and Newcastle United are eyeing new centre-backs and have been informed of Tapsoba's situation. Arsenal have also followed the Burkina Faso international closely but are pushing ahead with a move for Ajax's Jurrien Timber instead. West Ham are set to appoint Tim Steidten, who previously worked for Leverkusen, as their new technical director and could also make their interest known. Unlike Spurs, the Hammers would be able to offer Tabsopa the prospect of European football next season. Another centre-back on Tottenham's radar is Marc Guehi, but 90min understands they have been put off by Crystal Palace's Â£60m asking price and so are currently looking at other targets. A similar situation occurred in Spurs' pursuit of a new goalkeeper. They identified David Raya as their top target but were unwilling to meet Brentford's Â£40m asking price, with Empoli's Guglielmo Vicario set to join for roughly half that sum instead."
Bernardo Silva offered monster contract to join Saudi Pro League,"Jun 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bernardo-silva-monster-contract-saudi-pro-league,"The 28-year-old has signalled his intention to leave Manchester City this summer in search of a new challenge, having won every competition available to him after last season's treble. Silva is under contract at the Etihad Stadium until 2025 and remains a hugely influential figure for Pep Guardiola - his importance was highlighted by a brace of goals for City against Real Madrid in their Champions League semi-final second leg encounter. 90min understands that City are willing to facilitate an exit this summer providing they receive an offer of around Â£75m for Silva, which wouldn't be a problem for the cash-rich Saudi Pro League. And sources have told 90min that Silva has received a contract offer from the Middle East worth around Â£80m-a-year - an astonishing figure that could earn him the equivalent of Â£220,000-a-day. manual But despite the riches on offer to Silva and many others, 90min further understands that his current preference is to stay and compete in Europe. Barcelona is his ideal destination and the player's camp have held talks with La Blaugrana about a potential transfer. But it's unlikely the club will be able to raise the funds needed to pry him away from City, leaving Paris Saint-Germain leading the chase for Silva. The Ligue 1 giants are willing to meet City's price tag and have the financial firepower to offer him a wage increase on what he's earning in Manchester.  Silva has held productive talks with sporting advisor Luis Campos but will only make a decision on his future once he knows who is succeeding Christophe Galtier as the club's head coach - Luis Enrique is the candidate PSG hope to now appoint after talks with Julian Nagelsmann fell through. The Portuguese international has prior experience of playing in Ligue 1 following a three-year stint with Monaco. He was part of the young side that toppled PSG and won the French title in 2017, earning him a Â£43.5m move to City."

Tottenham schedule Guglielmo Vicario medical amid Serie A interest,"Jun 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-schedule-guglielmo-vicario-medical-amid-serie-a-interest,"Spurs have spent recent months identifying goalkeeper targets and finding potential long-term successors to club captain Hugo Lloris, who has admitted he wants to leave for a new challenge this summer. 90min reported earlier in June that Brentford's David Raya was their top target and personal terms were not an issue, but the Bees' insistence that the Spain international would not be sold for less than Â£40m proved to be an insurmountable stumbling block for Tottenham. They began looking at other targets at the start of this week and quickly settled on 26-year-old Vicario, who broke into Italy's senior setup last season and is viewed as one of Serie A's finest goalkeepers. Tottenham have agreed a â¬20m fee with Empoli and Vicario is set to fly to London to undergo a medical, but sources have told 90min that Spurs are wary that there could be another twist in this transfer race. Inter and Milan are both admirers of Vicario and are in similar positions where their current goalkeepers - Andre Onana and Mike Maignan respectively - could leave this window. feed As such, Tottenham are attempting to push through a deal for Vicario, who is in line to become their second signing under new head coach Ange Postecoglou following Dejan Kulusevski's permanent move. Speaking to Lady Radio on Thursday, Empoli president Fabrizio Corsi admitted that he was proud to see Vicario taking such a big step in his career. ""We bought him back to sell him on. We also paid a lot to sign him considering our finances,"" he said. ""It's a source of pride for us that the top teams have him in their sights. He's also a special person, not just as a footballer."""

Manchester City to rival Arsenal with bid for Declan Rice,"Jun 22, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/manchester-city-rival-arsenal-bid-declan-rice,"The seven-time Premier League winners have known for a long time that they may need to overhaul their midfield this summer, with the futures of Ilkay Gundogan, Bernardo Silva and Kalvin Phillips subject of intense speculation for a number of months. Captain Gundogan, who played a starring role as City won the treble last season, has come to the end of his contract at the Etihad Stadium and has opted to join Barcelona on a free transfer rather than renewing his deal in Manchester, while Silva has told the first-time Champions League winners that he'd like to move on amid interest from Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain. Phillips has not been a regular starter following his Â£42m move from Leeds and has actually been linked with a move to West Ham - potentially to replace Rice, who looks destined to move on this summer with just two years remaining on his contract. Arsenal have been leading the chase to sign Rice, submitting two bids to West Ham, and his preference is to remain in London. But they have been unable to agree a fee as the Hammers stand firm in their valuation and majority owner David Sullivan is adamant that he will not compromise on price - he is seeking a deal worth at least Â£100m plus add-ons. Sources have confirmed to 90min that City are now ready to act and have intimated to West Ham that a bid is forthcoming. Pep Guardiola's side certainly have the financial muscle to meet Rice's asking price, though there could be discussions about including Phillips in the deal despite his preference to stay and fight for his place. feed Indeed, West Ham's interest in Phillips dates back to his time at Leeds United, with the club making an unsuccessful bid of Â£50m in the 2022 January transfer window. Fulham's Joao Palhinha is another player of interest to the Europa Conference League-winning Hammers as they look for Rice alternatives, though their valuation of the Portuguese international may make a deal difficult to do. City are close to the completing of signing Mateo Kovacic from Premier League rivals Chelsea, but 90min understands that they do want to sign another midfielder on top. Bayern Munich's Joshua Kimmich is strongly admired but Rice is viewed as a far more realistic signing this summer as the Bundesliga giants do not to want to sell. Arsenal are expected to return with a third, vastly improved offer for Rice, while West Ham hope that a bidding war involving Manchester United will extract maximum value for the 24-year-old. The Red Devils also want to sign a central midfielder and know that West Ham have interest in Scott McTominay, who has recently starred for Scotland on international duty."

Chelsea paid tribute to Kante in a farewell message and now the 32-year-old, who managed 269 appearances for the Blues, has now penned a letter of his own. ""Goodbye Chelsea,"" Kante wrote. ""The time has come to open a new chapter in my career. But before doing so, it was important for me to thank the great and wonderful Chelsea family. ""Fans, players, directors, coaches, members of the medical staff, everyone who has supported me over the last seven seasons with this legendary club. So many fond memories, so many victories, so many titles won at your side. ""Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

""See you soon on the pitch for new adventures with Al Ittihad and Les Bleus."" Kante leaves Chelsea as a hugely popular figure but one who saw injuries limit his time at Stamford Bridge. After avoiding any significant physical issues for his first three years in London, Kante managed just 22 Premier League appearances in the 2019/20 season and would never manage more than 30 in the years that followed. 2022/23 was particularly tough for Kante, who was restricted to just seven league outings after a hamstring injury cost him five months and a groin problem brought his campaign to an abrupt end."

Empoli have asked for a fee of â¬20m to part ways with their goalkeeper, who joined them permanently last summer and kept seven clean sheets in 31 Serie A appearances, and sources have confirmed to 90min that Spurs are happy to strike a deal at that price. Numerous Italian sides have been looking at Vicario, with Inter previously seen as favourites to land the 26-year-old as their replacement for the in-demand Andre Onana, but Spurs have moved quickly to try and fend off the competition. Talks have already been held between Spurs and Vicario, who is understood to be ready to move to England this summer. feed Vicario is now expected to arrive and take the place of Hugo Lloris, who has one year left on his contract but has confirmed his desire to leave Spurs in the coming weeks. Strengthening in goal has been a top priority this summer for Spurs and they had hoped to lure Raya across London, but Brentford stood firm on their Â£40m asking price, despite the fact the Spaniard has just one year remaining on his contract. Raya, who has also been linked with the likes of Chelsea and Manchester United, recently admitted he was concerned his high price tag could prevent him from leaving this summer.

Liverpool given Saudi Pro League warning over Mohamed Salah,"Jun 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-given-saudi-pro-league-warning-over-mohamed-salah,"Cristiano Ronaldo kicked off the Saudi Pro Leagueâs ambitious surge in late December when he joined Al-Nassr. Karim Benzema and NâGolo Kante have since traded Europe for Al-Ittihad, while Ruben Neves in the verge of joining Al-Hilal, the same club that made an offer to Lionel Messi. Chelsea pair Hakim Ziyech and Kalidou Kouliably are in talks to be next, on course to join Al-Nassr and Al-Hilal respectively, and could be followed by Stamford Bridge colleagues Edouard Mendy and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang should further talks prove successful. Saudi Arabiaâs Public Investment Fund (PIF), the same group that is Newcastleâs majority shareholder, recently took control of the leagueâs four biggest clubs, suggesting that the stream of huge investment is not going to slow down any time soon. Al-Medlej is a former head of AFCâs marketing committee, having also been an executive board member with the confederation, head of marketing of the Saudi Pro League from 2008 until 2014 and a board member of the Saudi Arabian Football Federation for 13 years. ""All transferable footballers will from now on be targeted by Saudi clubs,"" he told Koura, going on to insist that the Saudi Pro League boom will not fizzle out like the Chinese Super League famously did. feed ""The experience of China has nothing to do with us, theirs was purely marketing,â Al-Medlej added. ""Soccer there is not the most popular. In Arabia we have a state project and it will not be limited to four great teams, but to all of them. Because the passion for football of the Saudis has no limits. ""We do not hire players who are already finished. Al-Hilal is going to sign Ruben Neves, who is 26 years old and who Barcelona wanted. And Benzema has already arrived at Al-Ittihad after being crowned the Ballon d'Or with Real Madrid, who is faced with the dilemma of replacing him."" ""The departure of the big stars from Europe will be a hard blow for the Champions League and the tournament will lose much of its brilliance. We have an example in La Liga. They lost a lot with the transfer of Ronaldo to Juventus. And then they lost more when Messi went to Paris Saint-Germain. ""The departure of the stars from Europe will affect sponsorship and television contracts. Messi is the best footballer at the moment and his incorporation would have provided great value. But we are not going to compensate him with a substitute player. ""Let's hope that Bernardo Silva, from Manchester City, arrives. We must also start working on the signing of Mohamed Salah since he is overwhelmingly popular in the Arab world and in Europe. I think Salah still has records to break with Liverpool, so I hope if he doesnât come now, he will in the future."""

Newcastle progressing with Sandro Tonali talks,"Jun 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/newcastle-progressing-sandro-tonali-talks,"The 23-year-old Italy international has emerged as Newcastle's top defensive midfield target and they are moving ahead a deal after the player's camp communicated his interest in making the move. Previous interest in Nicolo Barella at city rivals Inter cooled after it emerged he was not looking to head to the Premier League, leaving Tonali to emerge as the man they want. Tonali is considered with of Italy's best defensive midfielders and is captaining his country at the European Under-21 Championship being staged in Georgia and Romania. Tonali still has four years left on the Milan contract he signed in 2022, but Newcastle are ready to offer him a significant pay rise should he put pen to paper on Tyneside. feed With Tonali giving the green light, talks have quickly progressed since Tuesday and 90min understands that Magpies director of football Dan Ashworth is currently in Italy to oversee a possible deal as the two clubs are now talking over the terms of a transfer. Newcastle are looking to finalise the move for less than Â£60m, although with add-ons it is eventually expected to be around that mark. Newcastle majority shareholders PIF are determined to provide manager Eddie Howe with a squad capable of  competing at the top of the Premier League and in the Champions League, having sealed their return to Europe's top table, and Tonali is set to be the first of a number of new additions.

West Ham still keen on Man Utd midfielder amid Declan Rice rumours,"Jun 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-still-keen-man-utd-midfielder-declan-rice-rumours,"The Hammers are preparing to lose Rice this summer after he led them to Europa Conference League final glory in June, but will not sanction a move unless any interested party is willing to offer a package worth over Â£100m. Arsenal have seen two bids for Rice rejected by West Ham, the last of which is believed to have been worth Â£90m - broken into Â£75m in guaranteed money with Â£15m in additional add-ons. The Gunners are expected to return with a third offer for West Ham's captain, knowing they must up the ante because of the latter's frustration with how negotiations have gone so far. Rice's preference is to remain in London but he is very much still a target for both Manchester City and Manchester United, the latter of whom are looking to strengthen in the middle of the park ahead of a return to next season's Champions League. Reports elsewhere have suggested that United may look to use McTominay or Harry Maguire as a bargaining chip in a move for Rice, but 90min understands that any potential transfers away from Old Trafford for those two are unlikely to be as a result of being included in a swap deal. Indeed, Rice is still likely to join Arsenal at this stage - personal terms on a contract worth in excess of Â£200,000-a-week are all but agreed - and his desire to remain in the capital could see Chelsea re-enter the running should West Ham fail to agree terms with the Gunners over a fee. feed West Ham are keen on signing both McTominay and Maguire in isolation, with their interest in the former dating back to the beginning of last season, when Erik ten Hag bolstered United's midfield options with the signing of Casemiro. David Moyes is a huge fan of 26-year-old Scotland international in particular, with his dynamism and energy in midfield likely to appeal given West Ham's increasing match workload. Newcastle are also interested in signing McTominay but they're looking at boosting their midfield with a couple of high-profile additions - AC Milan's Sandro Tonali the latest target for the Magpies after initial interest was shown in Inter's Nicolo Barella - and that could see the Scot left out in the cold once final decisions have to be made. Maguire is another player that Moyes is appreciative of and it's no secret that United are willing to let their captain move on this summer. 90min revealed in April that the 30-year-old was open to moving to Serie A on loan, while Tottenham have also registered him as one of their top defensive targets."

Juventus waiting on Adrien Rabiot decision amid continued Man Utd interest,"Jun 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/juventus-adrien-rabiot-decision-man-utd-interest,"Rabiot was one of the standout performers in Serie A during the 2022/23 campaign, bagging a career-high 11 goals in all competitions and becoming a firm fan favourite at the Allianz Stadium after being the opposite in years prior.  The French midfielder's performances were all the more remarkable given they came in the final season of his contract at Juventus, with speculation rife over a potential move elsewhere. Manchester United have long been interested in Rabiot's services and that remains the case, but sources have confirmed to 90min that Liverpool, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur are not as keen on a deal as they once were. Old Trafford remains a viable landing spot for Rabiot - particularly if he confirms his intention to leave Turin - but with a lack of substantial offers on the table, 90min understands that Juventus are confident they can tie the 28-year-old down to a new contract. They are even willing to offer a one-year extension if that's what it takes to get a deal agreed. feed Another option is also emerging for Rabiot as interest from Saudi Arabia has been confirmed to 90min.

Ruben Neves, Kalidou Koulibaly and Hakim Ziyech are expected to follow suit in the coming days, while Rabiot's Juventus team-mate, Paul Pogba, has also been targeted for a move to the Middle East.

Chelsea reject second Man Utd bid for Mason Mount,"Jun 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-reject-second-man-utd-bid-mason-mount,"United launched their opening offer for Mount last week, but that bid worth Â£40m was rejected. Now, a second bid worth Â£50m has also been quickly rebuffed by Chelsea. The second offer was worth an initial Â£45m with Â£5m in add-ons, but that is still way short of Chelsea's valuation of Mount. Chelsea had initially demanded Â£70m for Mount, although sources close to the situation believe that they could be ready to drop to between Â£60m and Â£65m. That would still require United to raise their offer by at least another Â£10m, however. 90min understands that United boss Erik ten Hag is pushing his superiors hard to get a deal finalised for Mount, who he now sees as a hugely important part of their plans ahead of the new season. feed Despite the second bid being rejected quickly, the lines of communication between the two clubs remain open and a third offer is expected shortly. Chelsea had always hoped that Mount could yet be persuaded to extend his contract beyond its current expiry date of 2024, but even the appointment of Mauricio Pochettino as head coach has failed to lead to a breakthrough. It is believed that Chelsea are now accepting that there is too much 'bad blood' between the club and Mount's camp for him to commit to a new deal."
Arsenal agree deal to sign Kai Havertz from Chelsea,"Jun 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-agree-deal-to-sign-kai-havertz-from-chelsea,"90min recently reported that the Gunners had entered talks with the Blues over a potential move for Havertz, with Chelsea keen to strike a deal worth over Â£70m in order to recoup the fee they initially shelled out to Bayer Leverkusen in 2020. Sources have confirmed that Arsenal have, however, been successful in negotiating a lower fee despite Chelsea's initial adamancy that they would not accept less than Â£70m. 90min understands that a deal worth over Â£65m overall has been accepted by the Blues. Havertz is set to become one of the highest paid players at the Emirates Stadium, alongside Bukayo Saka, once the deal is finalised. feed Havertz had previously been of interest to Bayern Munich and Real Madrid in recent weeks, with the former recently initiating talks with the forward's representatives. Real Madrid backed away from any potential deal in early June due to concerns over Chelsea's asking price for the German. The forward will join the Gunners following a rather inconsistent three-year stint at Stamford Bridge. Havertz scored 19 goals in the Premier League for Chelsea, but he will be most fondly remembered for his UEFA Champions League-winning goal against Manchester City in the 2021 final. "

Gundogan finished the season in fine form, playing a huge part in City completing the Treble.  City offered him the chance to remain at the Etihad Stadium but, after nine seasons in England, Gundogan has decided to join Barca - a decision which he confirmed to Pep Guardiola and the club's hierarchy after the Champions League final win over Inter. Sources close to Gundogan have always insisted that finances have not been a key factor in the deal, but based around his family. Gundogan has agreed what could become a three-year deal with Barca, although the final year is an option. Barcelona included the signing of Gundogan in their financial viability plans that were approved by La Liga earlier this month and once he puts pen-to-paper, there should be no issues with his contract being registered. Barca finally saw the new contract for midfield star Gavi approved earlier this week. The move gives Gundogan the chance to play for Xavi - someone who he has previously described as one of his heroes. Â ""There was not a specific player for me, but there were players like Zidane or Xavi, or even a player like Andrea Pirlo. They are players I loved to watch and enjoyed very muchâmaybe the reason is that I play a similar position to them,"" Gundogan stated earlier this year. ""As a central midfielder I like to watch how other controlling midfielders behave during a game: what kind of passes they play, what kind of solutions they have for different situations.

After putting in some superb performances during Croatia's run to the 2022 World Cup semi-finals, Gvardiol became a hot topic of transfer conversation once more, with 90min first revealing in December 2022 that Manchester City had held talks over a move. City recently made plans to firm up their interest in Gvardiol and they are now in active talks with Leipzig over a deal. A stumbling block in negotiations is Leipzig's â¬100m asking price, which City are adamant they will not meet. Nevertheless, there is a confidence in the camp of the seven-time Premier League winners that an agreement will be reached. feed In addition to City, Gvardiol remains a player admired by Real Madrid, though they have already spent a nine-figure sum on Jude Bellingham this window. Gvardiol was part of the Leipzig side that lost 7-0 to City in the second leg of their Champions League last 16 tie back in March, but his arrival at the Etihad would reinforce a defence that has added three centre-back signings over the last three summer transfer windows.  Ruben Dias and Nathan Ake joined in 2020 from Benfica and Bournemouth respectively, while Manuel Akanji proved to be one of the signings of the season when joining from Borussia Dortmund in 2022 for a fee of just Â£15m.

He was limited to just two Premier League starts all season, with both form and fitness playing a part in limiting his minutes.

Manchester United have long been trying to win the race for Kim's signature but progress in negotiations with the 26-year-old's entourage has been slow, allowing Bayern to join the race. Bayern quickly voiced a willingness to trigger Kim's release clause and set about negotiating a contract with the South Korean, and sources have confirmed to 90min that the German side are close to getting a deal done. Indeed, Napoli believe Kim is set to join Bayern and are now waiting for his release clause to be triggered early next month. feed United remain in talks with Kim's entourage but have not made any real progress over the past week, with the belief now that the centre-back is heading to Germany. Bayern have targeted Kim as they brace for interest in French international Lucas Hernandez, who has agreed personal terms with Paris Saint-Germain. President Herbert Hainer recently confirmed Bayern's desire to keep Lucas but, given he is approaching the final year of his contract, refused to rule out a sale. With Kim now expected to head to Germany, Man Utd will have to look elsewhere and have a number of alternative targets under consideration, including Leeds' Robin Koch and Monaco's Axel Disasi. United are open to parting ways with Harry Maguire but the England international remains determined to stay and fight for his place at Old Trafford."
Arsenal in talks with Southampton over midfielder Romeo Lavia,"Jun 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-talks-southampton-midfielder-romeo-lavia,"The Gunners remain locked in negotiations with West Ham over first-choice target Declan Rice, for whom a Â£90m bid was recently rejected, but there are plans to add at least one other midfielder as well. Moises Caicedo is strongly admired by Arsenal but Brighton's near Â£100m asking price has seen the club look in another direction, namely towards Belgian teenager Lavia. Sources have confirmed to 90min that talks have been held over a move for the 19-year-old, who was a stand-out performer for Southampton last season and has no shortage of teams keen to offer him the chance to remain in the Premier League. Indeed, Chelsea are long-time admirers of Lavia through Blues director Joe Shields, who recruited Lavia during his time at Manchester City and also played a role in the midfielder's move to Southampton last summer. Shields has ensured that Chelsea remain informed on Lavia, but as it stands, the Blues are prioritising other targets and are pushing to strike a deal for Caicedo. feed Liverpool, Manchester United and Newcastle are all interested in recruiting Lavia but, like Chelsea, have other priorities at this moment. However, the mounting interest in Lavia's services could spark some of his suitors into life. Southampton accept that they are set to lose Lavia but are prepared to wait until they receive the right offer for his services. The Saints had been asking for Â£50m before their relegation from the Premier League but are now expected to accept slightly less. As part of his sale to Southampton, Manchester City also secured a buy-back clause for Lavia worth around Â£40m, but that clause is only valid for the summer of 2024 and would be wiped out if the midfielder moves clubs this year."

However, Son has put an end to any uncertainty, making it abundantly clear that the level of competition in the Premier League is more valuable than any money on offer in the Saudi Pro League. ""Right now, money is not important to me,"" Son confirmed. ""The most important thing is to play in a league that I enjoy playing in.  ""I have so much more I want to accomplish in the Premier League. I absolutely love playing in the Premier League, so I want to prepare for the next season the best I can.""

""Iâve only played for Ange for half a year, but I already know that heâs tactically exceptional.

Leicester standing firm on James Maddison asking price in talks with Newcastle & Tottenham,"Jun 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/leicester-standing-firm-james-maddison-asking-price-talks-newcastle-tottenham,"The Foxes were relegated from the Premier League on the final day of the 2022/23 season despite Maddison returning to form during the campaign, registering ten goals and nine assists in 30 games. The 26-year-old also recaptured his place in the England squad having been selected by Gareth Southgate for the 2022 FIFA World Cup as well as their Euro 2024 qualifiers in March and June. Maddison wants to leave Leicester but they are playing hard-ball in talks with interested parties Newcastle and Tottenham. Sources have confirmed to 90min that the Foxes are asking for Â£60m for Maddison and they are not actively pushing for an exit at this point, hoping that other clubs will enter the race. 90min reported in April that Liverpool were exploring a move for Maddison as part of their midfield overhaul. Arsenal and Manchester United had also looked into a deal earlier this year. feed But Newcastle and Tottenham's interest is firm and long-standing - the Magpies had multiple bids rejected by Leicester last summer, while Spurs have been linked with Maddison ever since he broke through at Coventry City in the mid-2010s. Tottenham opened direct talks with Leicester earlier this month and have signalled a willingness to make Maddison one of their highest earners. Spurs face the Foxes in a pre-season friendly in Thailand on July 23. Newcastle are yet to make a firm offer to Leicester but they remain in talks and are aware of the Â£60m price tag, though are reluctant to meet that figure and pay more than the Â£50m offered last summer."
Unhappy West Ham set to reject second Arsenal bid for Declan Rice,"Jun 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/unhappy-west-ham-to-reject-second-arsenal-bid-declan-rice,"The Gunners had an opening Â£80m bid for Rice rejected by West Ham last week and now have returned to the negotiating table with an offer worth Â£90m. It's understood the offer is worth Â£75m guaranteed plus Â£15m in additional add-ons, but it remains some way short of the Â£100m valuation that West Ham have long placed on the 24-year-old. Sources have told 90min that West Ham are fuming with the latest offer put forward for Rice and have no intention of accepting, with a third bid already being prepared by Arsenal, whose approach so far is surprising given they had previously indicated to West Ham in talks that they would pay their asking price. Rice has emerged as Arsenal's number one target in the transfer window, though Mikel Arteta's side are also pushing ahead with their interest in Chelsea's Kai Havertz and Ajax's Jurrien Timber. Southampton's Romeo Lavia is another player being considered this summer as the club prepare to sanction an exit to Saudi Arabia for Thomas Partey. feed But Arsenal, who believe they are making progress in their bid to sign Rice, must do more to convince West Ham to part ways with their captain, who recently lifted the Europa Conference League trophy above his head to end the club's 43-year wait for major silverware. Personal terms are not expected to be a problem with Rice - he is likely to command wages well in excess of Â£200,000-a-week - but Arsenal must act quickly if they are to ensure that Manchester City don't look to tempt him with a move to the Etihad Stadium. The seven-time Premier League winners may need to replace their own captain, Ilkay Gundogan, as he continues to weigh up his future at the Etihad Stadium after completing a history-making treble during 2022/23.

While Kane enjoyed a superb statistical 2022/23 campaign, becoming the all-time scorer for both Tottenham and England in the process, his team came eighth in the Premier League table - their lowest finish since 2008/09. Spurs' chaotic season saw them cycle through three managers, with Ryan Mason ending the campaign in charge after Antonio Conte and then Cristian Stellini were both sacked. Former Celtic boss Ange Postecoglou has now been named head coach on a four-year deal. feed 90min reported last month that, although Bayern Munich, Manchester United, PSG and Real Madrid are interested in Kane, the belief across Europe was that the striker would not leave this summer. Following Postecoglou's appointment at the start of June, Tottenham then informed Kane they had no plans to sell him this summer. Sources have now confirmed to 90min that Spurs remain confident of tying Kane down to a new contract. He is not agitating for a move away at this moment and he could wait to re-evaluate his situation closer to the expiry of his contract next year. Tottenham are continuing to scour the transfer market for reinforcements ahead of the new season. 90min understands that James Maddison remains a top target, though they could back away from David Raya due to Brentford's firm Â£40m asking price."
Daley Blind admits interest in returning to Man Utd,"Jun 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/daley-blind-admits-interest-in-returning-to-man-utd,"Blind spent four years with United after joining the club from Ajax off the back of an impressive 2014 World Cup campaign with Netherlands â he followed Louis van Gaal to Manchester. The Dutchman was of particular importance during the 2015/16 campaign, transitioning into the centre of defence and making more appearances (56) than any other player as United lifted the FA Cup. But he became less prominent under Jose Mourinho and was sold back to Ajax in 2018. Back in Amsterdam, Blind was an integral part of Ten Hagâs Ajax side that won a domestic league and cup double, as well as making waves in Europe by getting to within a single kick of the 2019 Champions League and claiming scalps of Real Madrid and Juventus along the way. Blind ended up leaving Ajax by mutual consent midway through the 2022/23 season. He was quickly snapped up by Bayern Munich on a short-term contract to plug a gap in the squad, but has revealed during an appearance on the UTD Podcast he was tempted to call Ten Hag. feed ""To be honest, he has the same agent as me, so the connection is not that far away,"" Blind explained. Although he thought about it, the 33-year-old didnât actually pick up the phone in the end. ""He did not really need me at that moment,"" the player said. ""He [had] already bought some players in. [Lisandro] Martinez as well, in the same position, and I am not blaming him for that. I am very thankful for the time [I had] with him. I learned a lot from him.""

Gavi urges Barcelona to sign midfield target,"Jun 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/gavi-urges-barcelona-sign-midfield-target-martin-zubimendi,"La Blaugrana are on the hunt for midfield reinforcements following the departure of club legend Sergio Busquets. Zubimendi, who played a starring role for Real Sociedad as they secured a top-four finish during the 2022/23 La Liga season, has been heavily linked with a move this summer, with Arsenal and Barcelona said to be interested. He has now received an endorsement from Spain teammate Gavi, who revealed in an interview with SPORT that he thinks Zubimendi would make an excellent replacement for Busquets. When asked if he's talked to Zubimendi about a transfer, Gavi replied: ""No, I respect him. I understand that he is at La Real. If he wants to play for another team or BarÃ§a, he will decide what he will do. ""Zubimendi is a top player. He would be a good replacement [for Busquets]. I love him. But I insist, we have to respect him and Real Sociedad. We'll see in the future."" feed Despite being heavily tipped to leave Real Sociedad, Zubimendi himself has stated that he is not looking to move on this summer. Addressing the intense transfer speculation recently, he said: ""Rumours, rumours. I told my agent that I didn't want to hear anything, especially in the winter. Leaving Real Sociedad during the season we are having would be illogical. Here, I am very happy. I look forward to a quiet summer.""

He was ruled out through injury for a couple of months prior to the 2022 World Cup break, but was a key player throughout 2023 and even captained the team on a number of occasions. But Walker, having played all 180 minutes of the Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid, was only a late substitute in the final against Inter. 90min understands that surprise snub annoyed the player and is a significant factor in considering his future. feed Ideally, City want to keep him and are open to a possible contract extension beyond his current deal that expires at the end of next season. But the club will equally not stand in Walkerâs way should he want to leave and would be prepared to sell in that scenario. Talks with Bayern have already taken place. But Sheffield United, the club Walker joined at the age of seven and for whom he made seven senior appearances before being poached by Tottenham at 19, are also keen following their promotion back to the Premier League. West Ham are a third club keeping a close eye on the player with strong interest. As 90min recently revealed, Saudi Arabia could be also be a lucrative option."
Chelsea complete signing of Christopher Nkunku,"Jun 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-complete-signing-of-christopher-nkunku,"The Blues first reached an agreement for the France international shortly after the closure of the summer 2022 transfer window.

But despite Raya's desire to join Spurs, the club are no closer to agreeing a fee with Brentford for his services. Thomas Frank reiterated during the final months of the 2022/23 season that Raya would be allowed to leave for a Â£40m fee, but Tottenham are unwilling to pay that sum and neither side has budged in recent negotiations. Raya has a year left to run on his contract and has already declared he will not be signing a new one, while Brentford recently completed the signing of his long-term successor - Netherlands international Mark Flekken. 90min understands that Spurs are keeping Raya informed of developments and that they are looking at other options. feed Empoli goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario has been linked with Tottenham, though 90min understands he is being lined up as a potential replacement for Andre Onana at Inter.

But less than a fortnight remains on De Gea's current deal and he is still yet to reach an agreement with Man Utd. In the meantime, 90min understands that Man Utd have been weighing up a move for a new goalkeeper in the transfer market. feed Man Utd's top targets are Porto's Diogo Costa and Brentford's David Raya. The latter is currently in talks with Tottenham, who are unwilling to meet the Bees' Â£40m asking price, but the Red Devils could stump up that sum and scupper Spurs' plans. Erik ten Hag also remains a huge fan of Andre Onana having worked with the Cameroonian at Ajax. 90min first reported in February that Inter may need to sell him in order to balance their books, while Chelsea have cooled their recent interest in the 27-year-old. Should De Gea sign a new contract, then it is less likely that Man Utd spend a huge amount on a new goalkeeper. Bayern Munich's Yann Sommer is a target for if the Spaniard does sign on."

Alvarez, who was the subject of bids from Chelsea and Newcastle last summer, has already agreed personal terms in principle with Dortmund, and they are now locked in talks with Ajax.

However, Arsenal have stepped up their interest and made a move for the 21-year-old, lodging an opening offer. Talks are set to continue as their opening bid of â¬35m (Â£29m) is well short of Ajax's asking price, which 90min understands is â¬60m (Â£51m). Sources with knowledge of the situation have told 90min that Arsenal see Timber as a right-sided version of Oleksandr Zinchenko - someone who can play full-back but has the ability to carry the ball into midfield and operate in a pivot if required. Timber spent this season playing centrally for Ajax, but he has experience of playing all across the backline and in midfield for the Dutch giants. New Ajax boss Maurice Steijn hoped that that Timber - one of the squad's star players - would be staying put, but he looks set to lose him as well as with Mexican midfielder Edson Alvarez, who is set to join Borussia Dortmund. feed Timber had made it known earlier this year that he was looking to move this summer, although as recently as last week he insisted he and his agent were not talking with any other clubs. ""Will I stay with Ajax anyway? Iâm not sure, I can't say that,"" he said. ""I'm not in talks with Ajax now. My agent had a good talk a few times, but it's not like we're talking about anything right now."" It now remains to be seen how high Arsenal will bid, but sources close to both clubs believe a deal is 'highly likely' at this stage.

There has been interest from other clubs given his form for Reims, but the Gunners are not rushing to cash in. Competition for places is likely to be tough next season at the Emirates Stadium, although one thing that could fall in Balogunâs favour if he stays is that the goals were spread around throughout 2022/23. Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli and Martin Odegaard each scored 15 in all competitions, while Gabriel Jesus got 11 in an injury-disrupted season and Eddie Nketiah pitched in nine."

Arsenal give Thomas Partey permission to explore Saudi Arabia transfer,"Jun 22, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-give-thomas-partey-permission-explore-saudi-arabia-transfer,"Saudi Arabia is pumping money into its league, which has already seen Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema take their careers there this year. There was also interest in Lionel Messi, while a host of other players including Hakim Ziyech, Kalidou Koulibaly and Ruben Neves are edging towards moves. Partey joined Arsenal in a Â£45m transfer from Atletico Madrid in 2020 and featured in 33 of 38 Premier League games this past season as the Gunners mounted a first title challenge in 15 years. But Arsenal are already seeking to evolve a promising young squad and are open to letting 30-year-old Partey go, despite returning to the Champions League and just three years after making him the then fourth most expensive player in their history. feed 90min understands that the appeal of Partey heading to Saudi Arabia on a permanent transfer, rather than staying in Europe, is that The Gunners are hopeful of potentially even turning a profit by selling for in excess of the Â£45m they paid. Although they would also be open to offers from the continent. Partey may not be the only midfielder heading for the exit as Granit Xhaka has agreed a deal to join Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen, although Arsenal are not prepared to sanction his departure until they have wrapped up a deal for a replacement. The Gunners are leading the chase for West Ham and England star Declan Rice, who is valued by his current club in excess of Â£100m.

Ansu Fati confirms stance on Barcelona future,"Jun 19, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ansu-fati-confirms-stance-barcelona-future,"The 20-year-old has long been considered one of the most talented young players in world football, but has struggled with a number of serious injury concerns throughout his short career to date. Fati has missed 88 games due injury issues, one of which kept him out of action for close to a full year back in 2020.  Although largely back to full fitness in recent times, the youngster was little more than a peripheral figure for Xavi Hernandez's La Liga title-winning team during 2022/23 season - being limited to 12 starts in the league and just two in Europe.  90min reported back at the start of May that this lack of game time led to Barcelona informing the player that he would be allowed to leave the club during the summer transfer window. Wolves and West Ham United were the two clubs with an interest in the player's services, with Jorge Mendes trying to engineer a move to the former, however sources confirmed at the time that Fati was not keen on joining lower-Premier League teams.  feed Now the player has given an update on his future, stating that he fully intends to stay at La Blaugrana this summer. ""I have a contract with Barcelona and my intention is to continue to improve and grow here. That is my intention. I have a contract and Iâm happy. Both at my club and with the national team"", Fati told Mundo Deportivo.

Blues co-owner Todd Boehly was recently in Saudi Arabia for meetings with a number of football officials, and the availability of Chelsea's fringe players was among the topics of conversation. The Saudi chiefs have moved quickly and sources have confirmed to 90min that Ziyech will be the first Chelsea player to head over to the Middle East this summer. Ziyech has agreed a three-year deal to link up with Cristiano Ronaldo at Al-Nassr and will soon undergo a medical before putting pen to paper on the move. feed As for Koulibaly, talks are progressing over a move to Al-Hilal.

Real Madrid confirm loan signing of Joselu from Espanyol,"Jun 19, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/real-madrid-confirm-loan-signing-joselu-espanyol,"The 33-year-old, who spent three years in the Real Madrid academy between 2009 and 2012, netted 16 La Liga goals last season but was unable to save Espanyol from relegation to the second tier, setting up his departure. Having lost both Karim Benzema and Mariano Diaz on free transfers this summer, Real Madrid were in desperate need of a new striker and the club have now confirmed Joselu's switch to the Santiago Bernabeu. Joselu joins on a season-long loan which includes an option to buy. Reports in Spain put that purchase clause at around â¬1.5m. The striker managed two appearances for Real Madrid during his first stint with Los Blancos, scoring in both La Liga and the Copa del Rey, and he will now have the chance to add to that. feed Real Madrid remain keen to land a new starting striker as well as Joselu. Having already distanced themselves from Chelsea's Kai Havertz, interest was lodged in Harry Kane before Kylian Mbappe found himself in dispute with Paris Saint-Germain. Mbappe will not trigger the extension option in his contract, which now expires in 2024. While Real are keen to land the Frenchman, club president Florentino Perez recently suggested to supporters that there would be no further signings. Asked whether there would be any more business after Joselu's arrival, Perez simply responded: ""No."" Should Perez stay true to his word, Joselu will be the third and final new face at the Bernabeu, with Fran Garcia and Jude Bellingham already making moves to Madrid.

Al-Hilal have offered a significant contract to Neves which has been approved by agent Jorge Mendes, and sources have confirmed to 90min that the player is now mulling over his options. Neves has never hidden his desire to play in the Champions League and Barcelona have explored signing the midfielder. Personal terms were agreed with Mendes but the La Liga champions have other transfer priorities and have not yet moved forward with their interest. That has allowed Al-Hilal to make a move for Neves and 90min understands there is confidence among the Saudi outfit that they have already wrapped up his signing. feed There is believed to be interest in Neves' services from around the Premier League but, as with Barcelona, the Portugal international is not a priority target for any sides in England. Wolves have not yet given up hope of retaining Neves but Mendes has made it clear to Al-Hilal that a transfer to Saudi Arabia is the likeliest outcome, particularly given their concerns over meeting Financial Fair Play regulations have left them needing to raise money. Should Al-Hilal complete the deal, it would represent a drastic shift in approach from the Saudi Pro League. Up until this point, officials have focused largely on free agents or ageing players, but a big-money move for a 26-year-old will be sure to send shockwaves around Europe."

Lionel Messi insists he is 'happy' with Inter Miami decision,"Jun 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/lionel-messi-happy-with-inter-miami-decision,"Barcelona were determined to re-sign Messi ahead of next season, having seen him join Paris Saint-Germain two years ago after financial limitations meant they couldn't register his new contract. Messi was initially ready to go back to Camp Nou â even now, he is still keen for him and his family to live in the city when he retires from football â but was left unconvinced over whether the club would have the spending power to actually make it happen. Upon his move to Miami being announced, the 35-year-old said he wanted full control of the decision and not for it to be left in the hands of others, as had been the case in 2021. But even with Inter Miami sitting bottom of the Eastern Conference as Messi prepares to join when the mid-season MLS transfer window opens next month, he has no regrets about the choice. ""I'm well. Initially, we had a different idea [than joining Inter Miami],"" he told Publica in Argentina. ""We're happy with the decision taken. I'm ready and eager to face this new challenge, this change. It was an important step but at the same time, I was aware of what it meant, of what I was doing."" manual Messi had already revealed that conversations with Barcelona never progressed to the stage of formal talks about money, and that he would have taken the offer to move to Saudi Arabia had that the financial side of things been his chief source of motivation. Instead, lifestyle appears to have been among the factors in choosing Miami over elsewhere. Back in 2020, then San Jose Earthquakes head coach and former Argentina international Matias Almeyda told 90min why he thought MLS would be a good move for Messi in the future â and it had everything to do with being able to recapture a degree of normality in his family life. ""The U.S. is a big country,"" Almeyda toldÂ 90min at the time. ""It has 350m inhabitants, I think.Â The stars here can walk in peace in the street. Each person who wants a life can enjoy what he likes [and] will live a different life. ""For [Messi], for his children, for his wife, he will be able to walk, to ride a bicycle, he will be able to go to the supermarket. He won't be under that fame that turns you into a slave, you know? That's why I think [USA] could be a good place for him. In that way, you turn to be a normal human again. All the players that want to be normal pick this place."""
Bernardo Silva hoping for imminent decision on uncertain Man City future,"Jun 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bernardo-silva-hoping-for-imminent-decision-on-uncertain-man-city-future,"Silva joined City from Monaco in a Â£43m deal in the summer of 2017 and has won 12 major trophies during his time in Manchester, including the Champions League earlier this month. He has made over 300 appearances for City and has usually been a regular starter throughout. But Silva first began to struggle off the pitch in 2020 during the UKâs first Covid-19 lockdown. And while he has been a consummate professional on the pitch, he has hoped to move on ever since. Just two days after the Champions League final, Silva again informed the club he wants to leave. feed âIâll be very honest, I donât know. Weâll see in the next few days. Even if I knew, it wouldnât be the space to talk about it [on international duty],â the 28-year-old told Eleven Sports when quizzed about his future ahead of Portugalâs Euro 2024 qualifying win over Bosnia & Herzegovina. Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain have been the clubs most regularly linked with Silva in recent months. 90min revealed at the start of May that City, who have been willing to sell players like Raheem Sterling, Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko in recent times, will not stand in the way of a summer transfer should a club be prepared to meet their valuation of Silva. However, that value is a potentially prohibitive Â£75m (â¬88m). PSG are firm admirers and would be ready to make a move, but the playerâs own preference is Barcelona. The issue for the Catalans is that any approach for Silva will hinge on first raising cash through player sales."
Kylian Mbappe offers cryptic response over PSG future,"Jun 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/kylian-mbappe-offers-cryptic-response-over-psg-future,"Mbappe wrote a letter to confirm he would not trigger the one-year extension in his contract, which is due to expire in 2024, and attracted the frustration of his current employers when he tried to explain his decision. It's left PSG forced to consider selling Mbappe this summer before he can walk away for free at the end of the coming campaign, with Real Madrid desperate to finally lure the Frenchman over to the Santiago Bernabeu. Mbappe has previously insisted he is not looking to join Real Madrid this summer and recently reiterated his wish to remain with PSG for the 2023/24 campaign. While an extension currently seems unlikely, Mbappe insisted 'a lot can change' at the club in the coming 12 months, teasing the idea of fresh terms. manual ""I have already said before that Iâd stay [at PSG]. I have only decided to play at PSG next season,"" he told Telefoot.  ""Many things can happen in a year, especially at a club like PSG."" Despite Mbappe's determination, PSG could choose to cash in on the 24-year-old this summer. 90min understands club officials are adamant Mbappe will not be allowed to leave for free and so a summer sale may be their preferred option, although valuing the France forward may not be easy. PSG, understandably, have placed an enormous asking price on Mbappe's head but, given he is approaching the final year of his contract, suitors are reluctant to break the bank just 12 months before he could join for free."

Manchester United and Newcastle have additionally shown interest, but Roqueâs own preference has also been Barcelona.

Personal terms between the Catalans and Roque have already been in place for several months. But Athletico have been waiting for Barcelona to strike a deal with them regarding the transfer fee that would take the player to Spain. The agreed price will be around the â¬40m mark, but the two clubs are yet to agree the breakdown of the payments.

Villarreal striker Nicolas Jackson is close to a Â£30m move to Stamford Bridge after being identified as a cheaper alternative to Napoli's Victor Osimhen, who is valued at over Â£100m. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea are now looking for cheaper alternatives to both Caicedo and Onana after growing concerned about the costs of striking both deals. Brighton are looking for close to Â£100m to sell Caicedo - a fee Chelsea are reluctant to meet - and so the likes of Southampton's Romeo Lavia and Inter's Nicolo Barella have been mentioned as possible targets. Chelsea are still keen on Caicedo, however, and will continue attempting to negotiate a lower fee. feed Similarly, Inter are standing firm on their asking price for Andre Onana, whose future has been linked to that of Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku as he eyes a permanent return to the Serie A side. With a deal proving complicated thus far, Chelsea are analysing their options in goal and have not yet ruled out beginning the season with Kepa Arrizabalaga as their starter. Among the options being considered are Valencia's Giorgi Mamardashvili and Brentford's David Raya, while AC Milan's Mike Maignan is an expensive target who could be outside of Chelsea's price range. While Chelsea are understood to be prepared to invest heavily in their squad this summer, there is an acceptance that player sales will play a significant part in defining their budget going forwards. Mateo Kovacic is on the cusp of joining Manchester City, while Kai Havertz and Mason Mount are wanted by Arsenal and Manchester United respectively. Edouard Mendy, Kalidou Koulibaly, Hakim Ziyech and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang are all targets for Saudi Arabia.

UEFA president sends warning to Saudi Arabia over transfer spree,"Jun 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/uefa-president-sends-warning-saudi-arabia-transfer-spree,"Cristiano Ronaldo's switch to Al-Nassr in January has opened the door to a number of other players. Former Real Madrid teammate Karim Benzema has already made the move and plenty of high-profile names are expected to follow in the coming months as Saudi officials prepare to inject huge sums of money into their clubs. Asked whether he was concerned about losing so many stars to Saudi Arabia, Ceferin told NOS: ""No, no, no."" He then went on to argue that Saudi Arabia's approach to business this summer could actually harm its own footballing future and urged officials to look back at the Chinese Super League, whose lucrative attempt to become a global powerhouse during the 2010s ultimately ended in failure. The Chinese Super League saw a huge influx of money between 2012 and 2017, with players like Oscar and Carlos Tevez leaving Europe to sign some of the most lucrative contracts in history. But concerns over the long-term viability of the league led to changes in 2018, which limited spending and forced clubs to focus on producing homegrown talents. manual ""I think that it's mainly a mistake for Saudi Arabian football,"" Ceferin explained. ""Why is that a problem for them? Because they should invest in academies, they should bring coaches, and they should develop their own players. ""The system of buying the players that almost ended their career is not the system that develops football. It was a similar mistake in China when they all brought players who are at the end of their career. ""Tell me one player who is top, top age and who starts his career and went to play in Saudi Arabia?"""

Dutch international Mark Flekken has already been signed as a replacement. Chelsea and Manchester United are both known admirers of Raya but 90min understands that Tottenham are working towards an agreement over personal terms with the 27-year-old, although Brentford's lofty asking price is proving problematic. Speaking to The Times, Raya confirmed he is keen to leave Brentford this summer but voiced concerns over the price put on his head. ""I will always feel close to this team,"" Raya stressed. ""Being part of the promotion to the Premier League is something I will never forget. ""I know there are rumours about me leaving. There are some options for me to go but obviously Brentford are asking for a lot of money.

Chelsea closing in on Nicolas Jackson agreement with Villarreal,"Jun 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-close-nicolas-jackson-transfer-agreement-villarreal,"Personal terms have been agreed with the 21-year-old Senegal international, who ended last season with nine goals in his final eight La Liga games, and talks are on with Villarreal over a transfer fee. Jackson's contract contains a release clause which sits at around Â£30m but sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea are likely to strike a deal which would see them pay in instalments, rather than one up-front sum. Villarreal are prepared to accept such a structure. Should all go according to plan, Jackson will become the first signing of the Mauricio Pochettino era at Stamford Bridge. The towering forward was not Chelsea's primary striker option, with the Blues exploring high-profile deals for the likes of Victor Osimhen and Harry Kane previously. But the club's new recruitment team have identified Jackson as a worthwhile target and talks have progressed rapidly. feed 90min understands that interest in Osimhen remains, but Chelsea are aware that Napoli's huge asking price - well over Â£100m - could prevent a deal being struck. Jackson will join a young group of forwards all looking to impress Pochettino in pre-season. Academy graduate Armando Broja is back after a nasty knee injury ended his campaign six months early, while January signing David Datro Fofana is also seeking further involvement in the senior setup. It remains to be seen whether Kai Havertz will remain with the group as Arsenal and Bayern Munich are both keen to strike a deal. While Chelsea would prefer to keep the German around, their need to raise funds could see them cash in for the right price - thought to be over Â£60m. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is in talks over a move to Saudi Arabia and Romelu Lukaku also has interest from the Middle East, but the latter is thought to favour a return to Inter."

With the battle for midfield minutes at Real intensifying, 90min understands that Chelsea and Liverpool were among the sides to reach out to the Spanish outfit to enquire about Valverde's availability.

It is expected that Valverde, who has also been used on the right wing by Ancelotti, will remain a key part of Real's midfield alongside Bellingham, but the boss undoubtedly has a tough task at hand to keep all his key stars happy. 37-year-old Modric and 33-year-old Kroos are approaching the ends of their respective careers, however, and Valverde is seen as a key part of both the present and future in Madrid."

Dejan Kulusevski returns to Tottenham on permanent deal,"Jun 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/dejan-kulusevski-returns-tottenham-permanent-deal,"The Sweden international joined Spurs on loan in January 2022 on a deal which included an option to make the deal permanent for a fee of around Â£30m, but Spurs declined to trigger that clause and instead pursued a discount. As 90min reported on Friday, the two clubs settled on a fee of closer to Â£25m and Kulusevski has now completed his return to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Kulusevski has inked a five-year contract and becomes the first signing of the Ange Postecoglou era. feed Kulusevski endured a mixed 18 months on loan in London. He racked up seven goals and 16 assists in 57 appearances in all competitions, often looking like one of Spurs' top talents when he was in form. A red-hot start to life in England, which yielded five goals and eight assists in his first six months at the club, had Spurs fans relishing the bargain they had found but mixed form over the remaining year took a toll on the 23-year-old's statistics. Kulusevski's loan contract also included an obligatory purchase clause which would have been triggered if Spurs finished in the top four this season, but the Swede was powerless to stop his side finishing eighth. He is now set for a fresh start under Postecoglou, who 90min understands is keeping an open mind to working with Kulusevski."

Bayern Munich president slams Barcelona over Joshua Kimmich pursuit,"Jun 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-president-slams-barcelona-joshua-kimmich-pursuit,"While Bayern have always been determined to keep hold of Kimmich, 90min understands that the German's representatives have spoken with clubs across Europe, including Barcelona, to gauge the interest in the midfielder. Xavi was asked about his side's interest in Kimmich last month and did not shy away from discussing his desire to work with the 28-year-old, telling Mundo Deportivo: ""He is a super top player, who understands the game in a fantastic way. If there is an open door, there will be a negotiation with Bayern."" His comments appear to have frustrated Hainer, who questioned Xavi's conduct in a recent interview with Sky Sports Germany. ""First of all, Xavi was an excellent player and I have big respect for Barcelona,"" Hainer said. ""But I don't understand why they're openly and offensively 'flirting' with our player. Joshua Kimmich is an absolute cornerstone for us."" feed Confirming his desire to keep Kimmich, Haimer added: ""Joshua is a leader, has won many titles with us and will also continue to win titles with us in the future. He's firmly in our plans for the future and one of the players to build the team around."" Kimmich's situation has caught the attention of a number of Europe's top sides, with Manchester City also known admirers of the Germany international. However, he recently moved to calm the speculation on his future, insisting he still has 'big plans' for the future with Bayern. ""It was difficult not to come across [the rumours],"" he told BILD. ""Generally, Iâm not too invested in the rumours. ""I still have, as everyone knows, two years left on my contract and we have big plans [for those two years] at Bayern."""
Christian Eriksen backs Rasmus Hojlund to join Man Utd,"Jun 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/christian-eriksen-backs-rasmus-hojlund-join-man-utd,"90min understands that Hojlund is on Man Utd's list of striker targets for the summer transfer window, though Atalanta's asking price of at least â¬65m could prove to be a stumbling block. Man Utd are looking to bring in two strikers this summer - one ready-made forward with experience and one younger option, with 20-year-old Hojlund falling into the latter category. Eriksen, who joined Man Utd from Brentford on a free transfer last summer, was asked about Hojlund's potential move to Old Trafford prior to Denmark's 1-0 win against Northern Ireland on Friday night. ""I can see him [Hojlund] at Manchester United, but I haven't recommended him to Erik ten Hag,â Eriksen said to Ekstra Bladet. ""He is a fantastic guy and a good player and has really developed brilliantly at Atalanta. What the club ends up doing, I will not be able to answer."" feed Eriksen added: ""It's a club where there's a huge amount of attention because everyone has an attitude towards Manchester United. I had tried a lot when I came to the club. So I knew a little bit about what size the club was. ""For younger players who come to the club, it can be really difficult, because the club is the size it is now."" Hojlund enjoyed a superb debut season with Atalanta having only joined from Austrian side Sturm Graz last summer, registering 10 goals and four assists across 33 games."

Chelsea hoping to beat Premier League clubs to signing of Nicolas Jackson,"Jun 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-premier-league-clubs-signing-nicolas-jackson,"The Senegal international was one of La Liga's breakout stars of the 2022/23 season, scoring 12 goals in 26 games for the Yellow Submarine. He came close to leaving Villarreal midway through the season, with 90min reporting in January that Bournemouth backed away from a deal due to concerns over injuries which arose in his medical. The Cherries have been exploring a fresh deal to sign Jackson this summer after securing Premier League safety, but they face strong competition for his signature. Aston Villa are in talks with Jackson - the 21-year-old worked under Unai Emery during his time at Villarreal - while Newcastle United have been offered the chance to sign him. And 90min understands that Chelsea are now firmly in the race to sign Jackson this summer. feed The Blues are expected to have another busy transfer window. 90min reported earlier on Friday that they are in active negotiations with Inter over the futures of Romelu Lukaku, Kalidou Koulibaly and Andre Onana, while Arsenal and Bayern Munich are in talks over Kai Havertz. Chelsea have also reignited their interest in Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo, with the Seagulls holding out for a fee close to Â£100m. Conor Gallagher could head to the Amex Stadium as part of the deal, while Brighton remain keen on keeping Levi Colwill following last season's loan spell."
Tottenham reach agreement to sign Dejan Kulusevski on permanent deal from Juventus,"Jun 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-reach-agreement-dejan-kulusevski-permanent-deal-juventus,"The Sweden international has spent the last season-and-a-half on loan at Spurs and is set to continue his stay in north London. Kulusevski joined Tottenham back in January 2022, with his loan contract containing an obligatory purchase clause if Spurs qualified for the 2023/24 UEFA Champions League. But seeing as Tottenham finished eighth in the Premier League, this became an optional clause instead and the club have been working with Juventus to bring the fee down from â¬35m - 90min understands they have settled on a â¬30m deal. As negotiations over his future were ongoing, Kulusevski was not mentioned when Spurs announced their retained list, whereas fellow loanees Clement Lenglet and Arnaut Danjuma were. feed 90min reported earlier this week that Kulusevski - who was keen to join Spurs permanently - may have work to do in order to impress new head coach Ange Postecoglou, but sources close to his camp are confident that he will impress the Australian over the summer and throughout the season. Kulusevski was an instant success upon his arrival at Tottenham, linking up superbly with Harry Kane and Son Heung-min towards the end of the 2021/22 season and helping them to a fourth-place finish in the Premier League. However, due to injuries and general instability across the club, Kulusevski's 2022/23 campaign was not as prolific, ending the season with only two goals and eight assists across 37 games in all competitions."
Bayern Munich step up interest in Arsenal target Kai Havertz,"Jun 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-step-up-interest-arsenal-target-kai-havertz,"The Germany international has been heavily linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge this summer. 90min reported earlier this week that Arsenal were in talks with the Blues over a shock move across London, while Real Madrid had previously explored replacing Karim Benzema with Havertz but did not want to meet his lofty price tag. Bayern are also on the hunt for a new centre forward this transfer window, with 90min reporting back in March that they were considering a move for Havertz. Sources have confirmed that the Bavarians are stepping up their interest in the 24-year-old and are in talks over a deal. Arsenal are not out of the picture just yet despite Bayern's re-emergence in the race, with Havertz believed to be open to either a move to the Emirates Stadium or the Allianz Arena. feed Speaking earlier in 2023, Havertz admitted that it would be hard to turn down Bayern if they came calling, while he would also like to work with Thomas Tuchel again following their time together at Chelsea. ""Bayern is a huge club and for me, especially as a German, it's difficult to say no - but my goal has always been to play abroad and see a new country,"" he said. When asked whether he'd want to link up with Tuchel again, Havertz replied: ""Definitely! You never know what will happen in football. Everything can happen very quickly. Never say never."" Havertz has struggled to consistently make an impact at Chelsea following his 2020 move from Bayer Leverkusen, though did score the winning goal in the 2021 UEFA Champions League final against Manchester City. Meanwhile, 90min also reported on Friday that Bayern are in talks with Manchester City defender Kyle Walker."
Kyle Walker in talks with Bayern Munich over summer transfer,"Jun 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/kyle-walker-in-talks-bayern-munich-summer-transfer,"The 33-year-old has only 12 months left to run on his contract at the Etihad Stadium and has been assessing his options in recent months. He is not short of suitors - 90min first reported back in April that boyhood club Sheffield United were interested in a reunion with Walker, while West Ham United and clubs in Saudi Arabia have also emerged as potential destinations since. And 90min understands that Bayern are now in talks with Walker, with both parties sharing a mutual interest in finalising a deal. Bayern are set to part ways with right-back Benjamin Pavard this summer and so are on the lookout for a replacement to come in and compete with Noussair Mazraoui for the starting spot. feed Interestingly, Man City and Bayern have remained in close contact regarding the futures of Joao Cancelo and Joshua Kimmich. 90min understands the German champions want to keep Cancelo following his six-month loan spell in Bavaria, but for a fee lower than his â¬70m purchase clause. Man City are among several top European sides interested in Kimmich, who is considering his future at Bayern. Reports in Germany have claimed that head coach Thomas Tuchel has regularly been at the club's offices since the Bundesliga season ended and has not yet been on holiday as he is working on plans for the 2023/24 campaign. Bayern wrestled the Bundesliga title away from rivals Borussia Dortmund on the final day of the 2022/23 season in dramatic fashion, with BVB losing at home to Mainz and Die Roten beating Koln late on to jump back into top spot. Despite Tuchel's European pedigree, Bayern were emphatically dumped out of the UEFA Champions League at the quarter-final stage by eventual winners Man City."

Chelsea confirm departure of Tiemoue Bakayoko,"Jun 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-confirm-departure-tiemoue-bakayoko,"A Â£40m signing from Monaco in 2017, Bakayoko was the second-biggest purchase in club history at the time but he would spend just one campaign with the first team before spending the next five years out on loan. Bakayoko made 43 appearances for Chelsea in the 2017/18 campaign and never ended up playing for the Blues again, with his final competitive outing coming in a 3-0 loss to Newcastle on the final day of the campaign. A loan to AC Milan was arranged for the 2018/19 campaign, with the Rossoneri including an option to buy, but a mixed run of form saw them reject the offer and Bakayoko would eventually return to Monaco for the 2019/20 season. Monaco also declined to trigger their purchase option for Bakayoko, who was back in Italy the following campaign for a reunion with former Milan boss Gennaro Gattuso. feed He returned to Chelsea in the summer of 2021 and agreed a two-year loan with Milan which included an obligation to buy if Bakayoko made 15 Serie A appearances in either campaign, but he was restricted to just 14 outings in 2021/22 before being handed just 39 minutes across three appearances this past season. Despite his Chelsea contract running until 2024, the Blues have now bid farewell to Bakayoko 12 months earlier than expected. ""We thank Tiemoue for his contribution during his season at Stamford Bridge,"" a club statement read. The summer transfer window in which Bakayoko arrived at Chelsea has gone down in infamy for its poor return. Aside from the success story of Antonio Rudiger and the reliable service of backup goalkeeper Willy Caballero, the Blues spent a total of Â£146m to land Bakayoko, Davide Zappacosta, Alvaro Morata and Danny Drinkwater. The quartet would combine for just 190 appearances for the club."
Man Utd exclude David de Gea from end of season retained list,"Jun 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-exclude-david-de-gea-end-of-season-retained-list,"The 32-year-old has completed his 12th season at Old Trafford, which saw him scoop the Premier League's Golden Glove award for the most clean sheets. But the Spaniard's displays haven't all been singing and dancing, with concerns raised over De Gea's ability to distribute the ball the way Erik ten Hag would like. He has also made various blunders when attempting to stop shots despite pulling off a glut of sensational saves. 90min has reported at length that despite those concerns, United and Ten Hag are keen to tie down De Gea to a new contract at Old Trafford. But there will need to be a significant reduction in his Â£350,000-a-week wages and that's something the former Atletico Madrid stopper has agreed in principle. Nevertheless, United have been unable to confirm De Gea's retention when confirming which players will be staying at Old Trafford and which will be leaving, and instead revealed that talks are ongoing over a new deal. Phil Jones, Axel Tuanzebe, Ethan Galbraith, Di'Shon Bernard, Eric Hanbury, Charlie Wellens and Manni Norkett are the seven players departing, but contract extensions have been triggered for goalkeeping duo Tom Heaton and Nathan Bishop. feed United's desire for De Gea to stay has not affected their plans to bring a new goalkeeper to the club. Porto's Diogo Costa and Brentford's David Raya are two players they are keeping a close eye on, while sources have confirmed to 90min that the club are monitoring the situation of Inter's Andre Onana - he has been a long-term target for Chelsea and could cost around Â£40m. Ten Hag's other priority is to sign a new striker capable of becoming the club's regular number nine. Anthony Martial has proven to be unreliable injury wise and Wout Weghorst's loan spell at the club was only ever seen as a short-term measure.  Harry Kane, Victor Osimhen and Dusan Vlahovic are three of the more high-profile players on United's shortlist, with interest in lesser-known stars Benjamin Sesko and Rasmus Hojlund also ongoing."

Frattesi became the subject of interest from clubs in England. Brighton made an approach to sign him, while the likes of Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham had also checked on his situation in recent months. Brighton, who have already lost Alexis Mac Allister this summer and look set to sell Moises Caicedo, identified Frattesi as one of their summer targets. feed Though the prospect of linking up with Roberto De Zerbi did appeal to the midfielder, Frattesi madeÂ It clear that he did not feel a move to the Premier League was right for him at this time. Speaking from the Italian camp at the Nations League finals in the Netherlands, Frattesi confirmed that he would be staying in Italy next season. ""I don't feel ready to go abroad yet, I'd rather stay in Italy and I also told this to the Sassuolo director. This is what I have decided,"" he told Sky Italia. Inter are now firm favourites to land Frattesi ahead of Juventus and city rivals Milan. Sassuolo are hoping to earn around â¬35m from the move."

While no agreements have been reached thus far, sources close to the situation have told 90min that the meeting was productive and has given both sides a better idea of their demands. The most high-profile topic of discussion was Lukaku, who is due to return to Chelsea this summer following the expiry of his loan with Inter. Inter have confirmed their desire to keep Lukaku, who they sold to Chelsea for Â£97.5m just two years ago, and talks over such a deal will continue. The Blues want a permanent departure but the cost of such a transfer would be tough for Inter. Lukaku also has interest from Saudi Arabia but has made it clear that his top priority is to remain with Inter. feed The Serie A side also hope to strike a deal to sign centre-back Koulibaly on loan, but the 31-year-old's high wages also pose an issue to any move and either Chelsea or Koulibaly would likely have to contribute. Blues co-owner Todd Boehly has also alerted sides in Saudi Arabia to Koulibaly's availability and the player himself is understood to be considering his options. In the opposite direction, Chelsea hope to strike a deal to sign goalkeeper Onana but now face rival interest from Manchester United, who are looking for more competition for David de Gea, United, managed by Onana's former Ajax boss Erik ten Hag, are tracking developments with Chelsea and Inter are hopeful of sparking an auction which would raise the goalkeeper's price."
Mohamed Salah's agent speaks out on PSG transfer rumours,"Jun 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/mohamed-salah-agent-psg-transfer-rumours,"French outlet Sports Zone recently claimed that Salah held a meeting with Al-Khelaifi in Morocco, even going as far as to state that contact between the two has been near-constant since the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The report found its way to Salah's agent, Ramy Abbas Issa, who wasted little time in publicly shooting it down. ""He did not [meet him]. Thatâs the short story,"" he said on Twitter. Abbas has previously dismissed rumours of a link between Salah and Al-Khelaifi, tweeting back in January: ""There isnât enough shaming of people/outlets who confidently report on stories with âhard factsâ which then turn out to be garbage and just random stabs in the dark."" 31-year-old Salah signed a new contract at Liverpool last summer to tie himself to the club until 2025 and the Reds are not interested in parting ways with their top scorer. feed As for PSG, they remain on the hunt for attacking reinforcements at the start of a summer which could yield astronomical changes in the French capital. Lionel Messi has already departed the club and sealed a move to Inter Miami, while Kylian Mbappe's recent letter confirming his decision not to trigger the extension in his contract could see the French superstar sold for the right price as well. Manchester City's Bernardo Silva is among the targets for PSG, who could pursue the Portugal international after he informed City of his desire to leave this summer. The focus on Merseyside, meanwhile, is reinforcing Jurgen Klopp's squad with central midfielders as Liverpool bid to assemble a squad capable of getting back into the Premier League title mix. Alexis Mac Allister has already joined from Brighton on a long-term contract, with Nice's Khephren Thuram and Gladbach's Manu Kone two other high-profile targets."
Raphinha sends firm transfer message amid Arsenal & Newcastle links,"Jun 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/raphinha-transfer-message-arsenal-newcastle,"The Brazil international bagged ten goals and 12 assists in a solid debut year at Barcelona and has been identified by both Arsenal and Newcastle as a possible summer transfer target. While Barcelona want to keep Raphinha around, their need to raise money and trim their wage bill has led to reports that the 26-year-old could be sold for the right price, but that is something the winger himself is clearly not interested in. ""I will stay at BarÃ§a next season and the season after next, and the season after that, I have many years on my contract and I hope to serve those years and many more,"" he told Club Del Deportista. He added: ""Barcelona is a city I love, we Brazilians are very happy here."" feed Raphinha came under criticism for a slot start to life in Catalonia. He managed just one goal and one assist in his first ten outings in La Liga but soon developed into one of Xavi's most dependable players, and Raphinha was keen to praise the manager for his continued faith. ""My first six months were difficult. It was a start to the season in which I scored few goals, made few assists, and didnât play a direct role in the team,"" he explained. ""But then I started to adapt better, my teammates helped me a lot. ""We have a coach who knows perfectly the way Barcelona play, someone who knows the club inside out.

Brighton firm on Moises Caicedo fee as Chelsea near personal terms agreement,"Jun 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/brighton-moises-caicedo-chelsea-near-personal-terms-agreement,"Chelsea are emerging as leading suitors for the Ecuador international, who is also on Arsenal's radar but is seen as less of a priority compared to West Ham United's Declan Rice, for whom an opening offer has already been rejected. The Blues are progressing in talks with Caicedo's representatives and sources have confirmed that an agreement over personal terms is close to being finalised, although Chelsea never had any concerns about being able to meet the 21-year-old's demands. Negotiations between the two clubs are ongoing. Chelsea and Brighton have been in constant contact throughout the summer over a number of issues, including the Seagulls' interest in Levi Colwill and Conor Gallagher, and Chelsea are looking to strike an agreement over a fee. Brighton are prepared to sell Caicedo this summer but 90min understands they value the Ecuador international at a similar fee to Rice - Arsenal have already seen an Â£80m bid knocked back for the latter. feed It is thought that Brighton could demand closer to Â£100m to part ways with Caicedo, who remains on the radar of Arsenal despite their pursuit of Rice taking priority. Chelsea are keen to take advantage of Arsenal's decision by swooping to sign Caicedo.

Indeed, sources have confirmed to 90min Man Utd and Tottenham have both spoken with Koch's representatives, while Brentford, Newcastle and Nottingham Forest are also understood to have held exploratory talks. Whether any of those teams will follow up their interest, however, is unclear, with most still drawing up their shortlists and exploring alternative options if they miss out on their top targets. Man Utd, for example, have been focused on landing Napoli's Kim Min-jae but face serious competition from Bayern Munich to sign the South Korea international and may be forced to turn elsewhere. feed Koch is set to leave Leeds this summer although sources close to the Yorkshire side have denied reports that the 26-year-old has a clause in his contract which allows him to depart for free as a result of their relegation.

In his single season at the Stadium of Light the youngster was one of the most impressive performers in the Championship, scoring 13 goals for Sunderland as they mounted an unlikely promotion bid - a bid that would end at the hands of Luton Town in the play-offs.

He was first asked by Sky Sports about the possibility of being joined in Spain by England teammate Kane, who is on Real Madrid's shortlist for Karim Benzema replacements.

Speaking to De Telegraaf about his frustrating first season at Bayern Munich, Gravenberch revealed that he would want to leave the club this summer if he isn't guaranteed more game time. ""I had expected that I would get more chances and minutes than I eventually got. I had done very good preparation and thought I deserved it,"" he said. ""I just want to play more, preferably at Bayern Munich. And otherwise at a club where I play 100 percent. That's my preference. Because I don't want to have another year like the one I've had now.

Bellingham is already a regular fixture in Gareth Southgate's England side, too, and played a starring role for the Three Lions at the 2022 World Cup having made the squad for the delayed Euro 2020 when he was just 17 years old."
Tottenham open to Eric Dier & Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg offers,"Jun 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-open-eric-dier-pierre-emile-hojbjerg-offers,"Spurs are laying out plans for the summer transfer window, with 90min reporting last week that new head coach Ange Postecoglou has given his approval to pursue top targets and strengthen in key areas. They are in talks with Brentford over a deal for goalkeeper David Raya - personal terms could soon be finalised but issues remain over the Bees' Â£40m asking price - while midfielder James Maddison is also high on Tottenham's summer shortlist. In terms of outgoings, Spurs' squad is in need of trimming ahead of their first season without European football since 2009/10. Club captain Hugo Lloris has confirmed his desire to depart north London this summer, though 90min understands Tottenham have informed Harry Kane he will not be sold. Sources have told 90min the other two members of the squad's leadership group, Dier and Hojbjerg, will be allowed to leave. England international Dier had been in talks over a contract extension but those negotiations have stalled. The 29-year-old's performances dipped during a 2022/23 season battling injury, while he revealed plans to leave Spurs and play abroad again back in October. ""Who knows where football will take me in two or three years?"" Dier told The Times. ""I'm still young, I've got a lot of time left. I'm looking after myself. I think I will play abroad again at some point in the future, but there's no rush on that. I would really enjoy experiencing a different type of football again. I think it will happen at some point and I think I look forward to experiencing football in a different culture because I loved it as a kid as well."" feed Hojbjerg was one of Spurs' top performers during the first half of the 2022/23 season and contributed several vital goals, including the stoppage-time winner at Marseille that saw them finish top of their Champions League group. The Dane has played a staggering 145 games in just three seasons at Tottenham, but he is not thought to be part of Postecoglou's plans at this moment and could be sold. The Australian is prepared to let a number of first-team players go as the club's rebuild takes shape, with Davinson Sanchez also up for sale. Meanwhile, Dejan Kulusevski may have to win over Postecoglou if his loan move from Juventus is made permanent. Sources have told 90min the ex-Celtic boss is not too convinced by the Swede at this moment. Spurs have just over two weeks to trigger their option to buy Kulusevski outright from Juventus for Â£26m. His optional clause would have been an obligation if the club had qualified for next season's UEFA Champions League. Kulusevski arrived midway through the 2021/22 season and instantly became one of the team's best players, linking up well with Kane and Son Heung-min. However, while he started the season brightly, the winger's form dipped during the second half of the campaign, though he was believed to have been nursing an injury during that period."

Speaking to RMC Sport on Tuesday, Konate revealed that he has a strong relationship with Thuram and he would love to see him join Liverpool. feed ""Khephren, he's like a younger brother, he's someone I saw grow,"" Thuram began. ""I was with his older brother at academy level. I saw him perform well and progress greatly...it was incredible. Even when he came to join the French national team for his first cap. I saw him in training and I was really surprised by his height and his technical ability. ""[I would be] very happy to see him join Liverpool, I would take him under my wing and I will do everything to help him progress. Now it's his turn to work. But I'll do everything for him to become a top player."" Konate has made steady progress himself at Liverpool since joining from RB Leipzig in 2021, making his senior France debut last year and earning nine caps so far at senior level.

When Napoli signed Kim from Fenerbahce, they had to swoop fairly late in the window to beat Rennes to a deal. As part of frantic negotiations, they agreed to put a release clause in Kim's deal which would allow him to leave for â¬50m in the first two weeks of July. Napoli are desperate to keep Kim given the impact he had in his maiden campaign and have offered him a new contract, which would include significant pay rise but also remove this clause. Sources have confirmed to 90min that the defender does not want to agree to this stipulation. feed Kim's representatives are continuing to hold talks with numerous suitors. It is believed their preference would be to join Man Utd, who are very much in the market for a new defender as they look to move Harry Maguire on. Premier League rivals Newcastle, who can also offer Champions League football, and PSG have also made contact with his camp in recent weeks. Kim is currently back in South Korea undergoing part of his mandatory military service, but he is due back in Europe by July."

PSG engage in war of words with Kylian Mbappe over contract talks statement,"Jun 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-war-of-words-kylian-mbappe-contract-talks-statement,"A letter revealing Mbappe's decision not to trigger his one-year contract extension, which would carry his deal over into 2024, sparked widespread confusion and shock among PSG officials. In response to the reaction, Mbappe issued a statement claiming that he has never entertained conversations over a contract extension with PSG, who have known for nearly 12 months that he did not plan to trigger the extension. PSG have now fired back at Mbappe, accusing the 24-year-old of 'emphatic' lies. ""It is emphatically untrue to say Mbappeâs team have not been involved in renewal discussions,"" a club spokesperson told the New York Times. manual With Mbappe's contract now set to expire in 12 months, PSG face the prospect of being forced to sell the forward this summer before he can walk away for free at the end of the coming campaign - an eventuality sources believe is not even being considered at this point. However, Mbappe himself has vowed to remain with PSG for the coming campaign, denying allegations he is looking to engineer a move to Real Madrid this summer. Real Madrid are looking for a new striker this summer following the departure of Karim Benzema and had been prepared to push for Tottenham's Harry Kane, with Mbappe seen as a target for a free transfer in 2024. Their stance may well have changed following this public bust-up between Mbappe and PSG, who could be forced to consider offers for the superstar in the coming weeks. The saga is the latest twist in what is shaping to be a defining summer for PSG. Lionel Messi's departure to Inter Miami has already been confirmed, while Neymar's representatives have explored the possibility of the Brazilian moving to Saudi Arabia. Christophe Galtier has also been dismissed as manager despite delivering the club's ninth Ligue 1 title in the past 11 years - a consequence of failing to deliver in the Champions League among other things."

However, reports in recent months have claimed that La Blaugrana could sell Fati in order to raise funds for incoming transfers. 90min reported in May that Barcelona told the winger he could leave the club, with Mendes attempting to broker a swap deal that would send Neves to Camp Nou and Fati to Molineux. But Fati has so far resisted attempts to leave Barcelona, with Mendes confirming this in a recent interview. ""Ansu wants to stay, he wants to stay,"" Mendes insisted to Jijantes.

Kylian Mbappe and Real Madrid: Timeline of transfer saga,"Jun 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/kylian-mbappe-and-real-madrid-timeline-of-transfer-saga,"The latest from France suggests a move away from Paris Saint-Germain is inevitable, but this isn't the first time we've seen such a situation develop in the French capital regarding their coveted superstar. Real Madrid, long-time admirers of the Frenchman, are bound to emerge as a potential destination for Mbappe if he was to leave the Parc des Prices, and here's a reminder of the Spanish club's history with the French forward.  Mbappe burst onto the scene for an excellent Monaco side that contained the likes of Bernardo Silva, Thomas Lemar, Fabinho, Joao Moutinho, and Radamel Falcao during the 2016/17 season. The young Frenchman, then just 17, scored 15 Ligue 1 goals and six in the Champions League as Monaco lifted the league title and reached the semi-finals of Europe's premier club competition.  Mbappe's staggering form piqued the interest of Real Madrid, with reports emerging that the Spaniards had agreed a deal with Monaco for the forward worth upwards of â¬160m.  The French club, however, denied striking a deal with Real. While Real's interest in Mbappe was certainly concrete, PSG saw an opportunity to snatch the Parisian-born youngster away from their grasp. Just three weeks after signing Neymar in a record-breaking deal, PSG made their move for Mbappe and offered Monaco â¬180m for the Frenchman's services. The French club were also willing to double Real's reported salary offer of â¬7m. PSG wrapped up the deal from under Real Madrid's nose at the end of the 2017 summer transfer window, with Mbappe joining on an initial loan. A buy-option, however, would keep him in his hometown until 2022. ð£ ""Cuando me dicen que FICHE a MBAPPÃ yo CONTESTO: ""TRANQUILO..."" ð£ð³ Â¡OJO a FLORENTINO PÃREZ en EXCLUSIVA con @jpedrerol! #ChiringuitoFlorentino pic.twitter.com/0LzM7FdEi9 To the surprise of very few, Mbappe blossomed into a superstar at PSG and would eventually break Edinson Cavani's all-time scoring record.  For several years, there was a level of serenity regarding Mbappe's situation in Paris, but this started to change in 2021 and Real, still bitter from the events in 2017, smelt blood. They started to pursue Mbappe with a renewed sense of purpose, and club president Florentino Perez even assured Real Madrid supporters the Frenchman would join Los Blancos that summer. ""I go with the mask and they tell me 'Sign MbappÃ©!' Madrid needs a change from time to time. I do everything possible so that Madrid does not lose its rightful place. Tranquilo!,"" Perez said, with 'tranquilo' translating to 'don't worry' or 'calm'.  He was a man with a plan. Reports had surfaced towards the end of the 2020/21 season that Mbappe was set to force his way out of PSG, and Real's renewed interest sparked danger for PSG with the player's contract expiring the following summer.  However, PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi refused to back down and at the start of the 2021 summer transfer window, he asserted that Mbappe wasn't going anywhere. ""I will be clear,"" Al-Khelaifi then told L'Equipe. ""Mbappe is going to stay in Paris. We will never sell him and he will never leave on a free [transfer]."" A summer saga developed and Real opted to make their move until the very last moment. PSG were pulling out all the stops to convince Mbappe to stay in Paris, with French President Emmanuel Macron even chiming in with his two cents.  However, an offer eventually arrived from the Spanish club in the final week of the transfer window reportedly worth â¬160m. And while PSG were unsuccessful in their attempts to bring Mbappe to the negotiating table themselves, they rebuffed Real's offer before ignoring the reported two follow-up offers made by Los Blancos as deadline day neared.  At the end of the 2021 summer window, Mbappe remained a PSG player but he was into the final year of his deal. Something had to give. Kylian MbappÃ© extends his contract until 2025  ð´ðµ #KylianCestParis https://t.co/x65CgD5hpO Mbappe's situation in Paris was a precarious one throughout 2021/22, with PSG seemingly playing with fire. There was a serious chance they'd lose the Frenchman for nothing the following summer. However, a resolution was found at the end of the season with PSG confirming that Mbappe had penned a new three-year extension with the club. The terms of the deal, though, were quite different to what was made out. Mbappe had actually signed a two-year deal which included an option to extend by a further year. Nevertheless, the Frenchman's new deal prevented another saga from developing throughout the summer.  Real Madrid, meanwhile, had just won La Liga and the Champions League with Vinicius Jr and Karim Benzema spearheading their impressive double. Mbappe wasn't seen as an immediate priority. Mbappe's surprise extension left a bitter taste in the mouths of those at Real Madrid, and reports in Spain at the end of 2022, after Mbappe had almost guided France to back-to-back World Cup triumphs, suggested Real's interest in the superstar had cooled.  Vinicius Jr's remarkable development into one of the world's best had lessened the need for Mbappe's arrival, with Perez's ego undoubtedly damaged by his failed pursuits of the PSG man. The Real president certainly wasn't used to not getting what he wanted in the transfer market. Mbappe's relationship with PSG seemed to be at an all-time high following his contract extension which made him a remarkably wealthy man and gave him an unprecedented amount of power at the club. However, as Les Parisiens were enduring another indifferent season which was bound to end in the Ligue 1 title and nothing more, these sweet relations began to sour. Mbappe initially wasn't particularly happy with the club's summer recruitment as they failed to land Robert Lewandowski and Aurelien Tchouameni. Then, in April, Mbappe wasn't best pleased when the club used his image in a promotional video sent to PSG's season ticket holders in a bid to convince them to renew for the 2023/24 campaign. ""I donât agree with this video posted,"" Mbappe protested on Instagram. ð¨| Kylian MbappÃ© has informed PSG that he will not extend his contract by 1 year, meaning his contract will run out next summer pic.twitter.com/z9WfA6J8J2 And here we are.  The latest development in the Mbappe-Real Madrid saga may well spark another summer of unrelenting rumours. Reports have come out of France suggesting Mbappe has no intention of triggering the clause inserted into his PSG contract that'd keep him at the club for an extra year. His current deal at PSG, the one he signed just last year, expires next summer which means Les Parisiens are once again running the risk of losing their most prized asset for nothing. Mbappe has insisted that he intends to stay at the club for the 2023/24 season, with his future beyond that being a doubt.  As for Real, Perez recently admitted that Mbappe remains a target, but striking a deal this summer will be tricky after they just spent upwards of â¬100m on England international Jude Bellingham."

Unsurprisingly, long-term suitors Real Madrid have been tipped to reignite their chase of the Frenchman this summer and Le Parisien went as far as to claim that Mbappe's sole focus is on moving to the Bernabeu before the start of next season.

""I have already said that I will continue next season at PSG, where I am very happy."" manual The dilemma for PSG, however, is that Mbappe is currently on track to depart the club as a free agent at the end of the 2023/24 campaign and is able to discuss a contract with his suitors in just six months. Club sources insist that Mbappe, perhaps the most valuable footballer on the planet, will not be allowed to leave for nothing next summer. Real Madrid are understood to be keen to reignite their interest in Mbappe, not least because of the departure of Karim Benzema to Saudi Arabia. Club president Florentino Perez was recently captured on video admitting his intentions to sign Mbappe in the future but ruled out making a move this summer, although that was before the Frenchman's announcement on his future.

""The management of the club in charge of the extension [was informed] as of July 15, 2022, of the decision [not to continue beyond 2024],"" Mbappe's statement read.

Mbappe had until July to confirm whether he planned to opt out of the final year of the contract - both club and player had to agree to trigger the option for it to be valid - but has sent shockwaves around Europe with his letter. PSG face the prospect of being forced to sell Mbappe this summer before he can walk away for free in 12 months, with long-time admirers Real Madrid keen on a deal after losing Karim Benzema this summer. 90min understands, however, Los Blancos are reluctant to pay over the odds for the 24-year-old, who was being lined up for a free transfer to the Santiago Bernabeu in 12 months anyway. Club president Florentino Perez was even recently filmed insisting he would sign Mbappe in the future, but that was before the France forward's letter pushed him closer to the exit at Parc des Princes."

Tottenham & Brentford still far apart in valuation of David Raya,"Jun 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-brentford-far-apart-valuation-david-raya,"Spurs had been searching for a long-term successor to Hugo Lloris even before their club captain revealed last month that he would look to leave this summer. 90min has long reported that Raya has been among their top transfer targets, with new head coach Ange Postecoglou recently giving the green-light to pursue the Spain international. And while Tottenham and Raya are closing in on an agreement over personal terms, 90min understands that Brentford's valuation of the goalkeeper is proving troublesome for Spurs. The Bees have continually insisted that they would be happy to sell Raya, who is out of contract next summer and will not sign a new one, for Â£40m. However, Tottenham are someway short of that figure. Brentford technical director Lee Dykes recently revealed that Raya is free to jump ship so long as this price tag is met. ""We sat in front of David and said listen, 'If you go beyond us, then that's the time for you to go',"" Dykes said on The Beautiful Game podcast. ""I think he's one of the best in the Premier League which puts him one of the best in the world. He's in a really good moment as a goalkeeper and he's well within his rights to say, 'Maybe I want to explore my options'. That's fine. No probs. ""We signed him again in 2019, that first summer. I'd seen him come through his loan spells in the lower leagues and really develop at Blackburn. It was a great deal for us but effectively we've had a plan for him and we're okay with that. ""We'll replace him if we need to replace him or he'll sign a new deal and stay. What will be will be. We have to understand that at Brentford, like Brighton, there are bigger clubs at there that can hunt for these players and we're always of the mindset that if we help them get to the very top level, we've played our part. ""As long as the club's remunerated adequately for any potential transfer, I'm sure Phil [Giles, director of football] and Matt [Benham, club owner] will make the right decision."" feed It was then put to Dykes that head coach Thomas Frank had been asked about selling Raya for Â£20m. ""Did he laugh?"" Dykes retorted. ""Listen, the market sets itself. This summer will be a big goalkeeper market, there's a lot of goalkeepers that will be available. Phil and Matt will assess the valuation at the time. My point at David Raya is you need to pay double because he can play number ten. You get two positions."" 90min first reported in March that Brentford would be willing to let Raya run down his contract if they do not receive an acceptable offer this summer. The Bees have already signed a long-term successor to Raya in Netherlands international Mark Flekken."
Romelu Lukaku & Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang approached over Saudi Arabia moves,"Jun 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/romelu-lukaku-pierre-emerick-aubameyang-approached-saudi-arabia-moves,"The duo are facing uncertain futures at Stamford Bridge, with Lukaku set to return from loan with Inter and Aubameyang being placed on the transfer list well before last season came to an end. Both players are on high wages, with Lukaku the highest earner at Chelsea, and so the list of potential buyers is limited. Chelsea co-owner Todd Boehly travelled to Saudi Arabia last week and sources have confirmed to 90min that the American alerted clubs in the Middle East to the availability of both Aubameyang and Lukaku. The Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF), who recently assumed control of Al Ittihad, Al Nassr, Al Hilal and Al Ahli, are now in talks with both strikers in the hope of convincing them to take summer moves to the Saudi Pro League. feed The PIF are confident that they can wrap up a deal for Aubameyang, who is keen to leave Chelsea in the coming weeks. The 33-year-old does, however, have interest from Europe, where former employers Barcelona are open to a reunion, but he is not believed to be a top priority. As for Lukaku, a move for the Belgian is far more complicated. He is keen to remain with Inter, who have also voiced a desire to retain him, but an agreement between the two clubs over either a permanent deal or a second loan is still a long way away. Chelsea are due for further talks with Inter this week, with Lukaku's future on the agenda alongside a number of other topics. The Serie A side are also known admirers of centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly, who could be included in Chelsea's attempts to sign goalkeeper Andre Onana, which will continue during the upcoming meeting. Koulibaly's availability was also discussed during Boehly's meeting with Saudi officials, with the co-owner also seeking to drum up interest in goalkeeper Edouard Mendy and winger Hakim Ziyech as well. The PIF plan to continue their pursuits of both Aubameyang and Lukaku, while they are understood to be open to exploring moves for several other Chelsea players who have been told they are free to leave this summer."
WATCH: Jack Grealish begs Bernardo Silva to snub Barcelona & PSG interest,"Jun 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jack-grealish-begs-bernardo-silva-snub-barcelona-psg-interest,"90min understands that Silva has once again made it clear to City that he would like to leave the club this summer, and Pep Guardiola is happy to take his usual stance of allowing any unsettled player to leave for the right price. A fee of around Â£75m is expected to be enough to convince City to sell, which may rule long-term suitors Barcelona out of the race. Silva is thought to be prioritising a move to Camp Nou but may be forced to accept an alternative landing spot, with Paris Saint-Germain also in the race. In the meantime, Silva has been celebrating his role in City's famous treble victory alongside social media superstar Grealish, whose celebrations have been just as entertaining as any of the football City played this season. It was during one of these parties that Grealish was seen praying for Silva to stay at the club, appearing to shout 'please don't go' at his teammate. ""Please don't go"" ðJack Grealish begging Bernardo Silva to stay ð pic.twitter.com/aJJbZAYTuR Grealish later admitted: ""There's one person in this team that I absolutely adore, and he looks homeless. His name is Bernardo Silva."" Silva, who still has two years remaining on his contract, confessed after the Champions League final that he was still in the dark over where he would be playing his football next season. ""Honestly, I donât know,"" he told Telefoot. ""Weâll see what happens in the next few weeks and months."" PSG may be forced to ramp up their interest in Silva following the revelation that Kylian Mbappe could leave this summer. The 24-year-old has made it clear he does not plan to extend his contract into 2025 and therefore has just 12 months remaining on his current deal. It leaves PSG forced to consider a sale in the coming months before running the risk of losing perhaps the most valuable player on the planet for free next year."
Arsenal & West Ham make breakthrough in Declan Rice talks,"Jun 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-west-ham-breakthrough-declan-rice-talks,"Rice has long been the Gunners' top summer target, but there had been a reluctance to meet the lofty valuation of the Europa Conference League winners, who are standing firm on their insistence that the 24-year-old will only be sold for in excess of Â£100m. But with rivals Chelsea and Bayern Munich circling, 90min understands that Arsenal have pushed ahead in their bid to land Rice and have told West Ham that they will pay more than Â£100m to take their captain to north London. An official offer is yet to be made for Rice but if Arsenal finalise the deal, as they are now expected to do, the 24-year-old will become the most expensive English player of all-time, surpassing Manchester City's deal for Jack Grealish and Real Madrid's summer move for Jude Bellingham. feed West Ham chairman David Sullivan recently confirmed that they plan to sell Rice this summer, having promised the club captain that he is free to leave if the Hammers are fairly compensated for his departure. Clubs from across Europe have been following the situation but Arsenal have made the first move by indicating a willingness to meet West Ham's asking price, with Rice understood to be keen on a move to the Emirates. Progress in negotiations over Rice comes shortly after Arsenal made another major breakthrough, this time in talks with centre-back William Saliba over a new contract. Saliba's current deal has just 12 months left to run and talk over an extension had been dragging on for nearly the entire season, but an agreement over a four-year deal has now been struck to hand Arsenal an enormous boost."
Rasmus Hojlund breaks silence over alleged Man Utd transfer talks,"Jun 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/rasmus-hojlund-breaks-silence-man-utd-transfer-talks,"90min recently reported that the young Dane is on the Red Devils' shortlist of striker targets for the summer transfer window. His club, Atalanta, would be open to selling Hojlund, but only for a fee north of â¬65m (Â£55m). The Serie A side paid just â¬17m to sign the forward from Sturm Graz last summer. Hojlund, who is currently on international duty with Denmark, was asked on Monday about reports that he has had a video call with Man Utd manager Erik ten Hag to discuss a potential move to Old Trafford. ""There has been no video call. I can't say anything about that."" he told Danish publication Berlingske. ""It's a huge club, so I must have done something right if it says they want me. My goal is to reach the top shelf, and you can say that Manchester United is. So it will be huge."" feed In further quotes relayed by Tipsbladet, Hojlund added: ""As you see and hear, I imagine a lot could happen to quite a few strikers this summer, as many clubs are looking for a No.9. Something will definitely happen there, and then weâll have to wait and see if I am included in it.  ""I am very happy to be with Atalanta and we have qualified for Europe. I have found myself in a really good place here, so now we have to wait and see. Hojlund only turned 20 in February but has quickly announced himself as one of Europe's top up-and-coming strikers. He scored 10 goals in 34 games across all competitions during his debut season with Atalanta, while he has already grabbed five goals in four games for Denmark's senior side. 90min understands that Man Utd are hoping to bring in two strikers this summer - ideally one in their prime and another younger option. Harry Kane, Victor Osimhen, Lautaro Martinez and Dusan Vlahovic are targets to fill the role of the experienced forward, while Hojlund, Evan Ferguson, Santiago Gimenez and Goncalo Ramos are seen as youthful candidates."
Why Real Madrid need Kylian Mbappe's help to facilitate summer transfer,"Jun 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/why-real-madrid-need-kylian-mbappe-help-summer-transfer,"The 24-year-old has informed PSG he will not be signing a new contract or activating an extension clause to take his current deal beyond 2024. The French champions have been stunned by this choice - reports from France even state they were confused by Mbappe's decision to write them a letter explaining his decision - and they face the prospect of letting him leave for free next year or selling him this summer. PSG have already lost Lionel Messi to Inter Miami on a free transfer, while Neymar's future at Parc des Princes is also uncertain amid interest from Saudi Arabia. Mbappe nearly joined Real Madrid as a free agent in 2022 before deciding to stay at PSG, which came as a huge shock to Los Blancos. Sources have told 90min that Real Madrid want to assess Mbappe's situation this summer a little more before making a decision. feed Reports across Europe have already claimed that PSG could command a nine-figure fee for Mbappe and 90min understands Real Madrid are reluctant to get into such a transfer war. Following Karim Benzema's departure to Saudi Pro League champions Al Ittihad, Real Madrid are on the hunt for a new centre forward, with Harry Kane, Lautaro Martinez and Dusan Vlahovic among their targets. 90min understands that Real Madrid would be comfortable prioritising a move for a natural number nine, though they would not have any concerns about fitting Mbappe into a system and believe he is capable of playing through the middle. While ultimately Real Madrid and Mbappe share a mutual interest in making a transfer work, Los Blancos will need the 2022 World Cup Golden Boot winner to help facilitate a move from PSG. Real Madrid president Florentino Perez was recently filmed being asked about whether the club would sign Mbappe, replying: ""Yes, but not this summer."" This was prior to Monday's revelations, however."

Kylian Mbappe tells PSG he won't sign new contract,"Jun 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/kylian-mbappe-tells-psg-wont-sign-new-contract,"Mbappe has attracted heavy interest from Real Madrid over the past few years, but first turned them down in 2022 when he signed a new contract at Parc des Princes. PSG retained the Ligue 1 title but are facing a summer of change with Lionel Messi departing after two seasons and Neymar also courting interest after another injury-plagued campaign. Mbappe was again consistent for the French giants but Champions League glory evaded them in a last 16 exit to Bayern Munich and Mbappe's decision now places further pressure on PSG.  90min understands the club are shocked by Mbappe's decision, which will force them to either sell this summer or let the World Cup winner walk for free in a year. feed The extra year is a mutual option, which means both sides need to agree for it to be exercised. Real Madrid are in the market for a new forward in the wake of Karim Benzema's move to Saudi Arabia. Los Blancos had previously earmarked Tottenham's Harry Kane as their top target and Florentino Perez was even captured on film saying Real would sign Mbappe at some point, ""but not this year"". Mbappe had said at the end of May he intended to stay at PSG and honour his contract, but his latest decision on his future will force Les Parisiens' hand. Real are already gearing up to announce the signing of England international Jude Bellingham, who recently passed a medical ahead of his initial â¬100m move from Borussia Dortmund."
Feyenoord land Premier League duo from Newcastle and Brighton,"Jun 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/feyenoord-land-premier-league-duo-newcastle-brighton,"Newcastle have just confirmed Minteh's arrival from Danish side OB in a deal worth around Â£6m and the young forward has agreed to join the Dutch champions on loan next season. Magpies sporting director Dan Ashworth said: ""We are very pleased to be bringing a player with Yankuba's high potential to Newcastle United. ""We look forward to working with him in this exciting phase of his development, and we're excited to see how he performs at Feyenoord, a club that also has a strong development record of its own. feed ""As well as supporting the first team with players for the here and now, we have a clear philosophy to invest in emerging talent and we want to provide a player pathway that will help to build and sustain long-term success."" Also joining Feyenoord is Belgian defender Tsoungui, who has signed a permanent two-year deal from Brighton. The 20-year-old joined the Seagulls in 2018 from Chelsea and made one first-team appearance for the club in the League Cup, before spending last season on loan with Belgian side Lommel. Brighton technical director David Weir explained: ""This represents a fantastic move for Antef, to be joining the Dutch league winners, and we wish him the best of luck for the future."""

Bernardo Silva informs Manchester City he wants to leave the club,"Jun 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bernardo-silva-manchester-city-wants-to-leave-club,"The 28-year-old, who is contracted to City until 2025, played a crucial role in helping Pep Guardiola's side achieve a historic treble, putting in particularly impressive performances in the Champions League - most notably scoring a brace in the convincing 4-0 win over Real Madrid in the second leg of their heavyweight semi-final. The 1-0 win over Inter in the Champions League final was the 14th trophy of Silva's City career, which started in May 2017 when the Premier League champions agreed to pay Monaco upwards of Â£60m including performance add-ons. But despite City's continued success over the past six years, Silva's future at the club has become increasingly uncertain. He admitted in August 2022, amid strong links to Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain, that although he was happy at City, he had 'no idea what's going to happen' in the future. 90min then revealed in September 2022 that the Portuguese international was one of Barca's priority transfer targets and the Catalan giants even saw a January enquiry turned down by City. Silva previously told City of his intention to seek a new challenge and 90min understands that he has reaffirmed his desire to leave this summer, with the club willing to do business providing they receive an offer around the Â£75m mark. feed Whether or not Barcelona have the financial means to complete a transfer remains to be seen, but 90min understands that Ligue 1 champions PSG see Silva as a potentially ideal replacement for Inter Miami-bound Lionel Messi. Messi had looked to be closing in on a fairy-tale return to Camp Nou after months of speculation and back and forth between agents, but Barca were ultimately unable to get their financial affairs in order to make a move possible. ""Although I heard it was said La Liga had accepted that everything was fine for me to return, there were still many other things that had to be done.Â I heard that [Barcelona] had to sell players or lower player salaries and the truth is that I didn't want to go through that,"" Messi said after announcing his intention to move to MLS. With Messi on his way out of the French capital, PSG are hoping to convince Silva that a return to Ligue 1 is his best option - although at this stage it's believed that a move to Barcelona would be the player's preference. Nevertheless, sources have told 90min that Silva and his representatives have a good relationship with PSG's current Director of Football Luis Campos, having previously worked together at Monaco. Silva famously won the Ligue 1 title with Monaco in 2017, ironically scoring a stunning goal against PSG to end the club's 17-year wait for a top-flight championship."

Their gamble somewhat paid off, but greater success in Europe is necessary if their current approach is to be a success.  Both clubs remain distinctly attractive destinations for players across the globe, and here's a list of all their dealings, along with other notable La Liga moves, in the 2023 summer transfer window."
Chelsea set asking price for Man Utd target Mason Mount,"Jun 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-asking-price-man-utd-mason-mount,"Mount will enter the final 12 months of his Chelsea contract this summer and has so far declined to sign an extension, despite new manager Mauricio Pochettino's desire to work with the England international. Chelsea officials have made it clear to Mount that they are prepared to sell him this summer if he does not extend, but sources have confirmed to 90min that the Blues are not prepared to be pressured into lowering their demands. A value of Â£70m has been placed on Mount's head and Chelsea have made it clear they will not sell the 24-year-old if their asking price is not met. That could be bad news for suitors Man Utd, who are keen to land Mount this summer but are currently not willing to offer any higher than Â£50m for his services, given his expiring contract and their need to invest in other areas of the squad. feed Chelsea have not yet given up hope of extending Mount's contract and are willing to sit down once again to try and thrash out an agreement, but no further progress has been made at this point. Any developments will be watched keenly by United, who believe Chelsea could lower their asking price as the summer progresses if they fail to convince Mount to put pen to paper. Pochettino, who made a successful return to management in England with a victory at the helm of the World XI in Sunday's Soccer Aid charity event, wants to keep Mount next season but faces an anxious wait to see whether he will get his wish. Bolstering in midfield remains a key priority for Chelsea even if Mount does stay at the club and Blues officials have not yet ruled out pursuing both Brighton's Moises Caicedo and West Ham's Declan Rice. There are also hopes to bolster in attack, where Inter's Lautaro Martinez has been added to a shortlist which also includes Napoli's Victor Osimhen and Atalanta's Rasmus Hojlund."

The free transfers Barcelona should target in the summer window,"Jun 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/the-free-transfers-barcelona-should-target-in-the-summer-window,"Many parts of the squad seem to need refreshing, there are a number of players that have been deemed surplus to requirements, and there is not a great deal of cash available to spend as they try to make sure they stay in business. That all points to one thing: free transfers. There are a number of very good players that are available to sign without a transfer fee this summer, meaning Barcelona will only have to worry about signing-on fees and wages.   Here are six players that Barcelona could look at signing without spending money on transfer fees. feed This is the obvious option for absolutely every club that can afford his wages. Ilkay Gundogan has been simply sensational for Manchester City this season and has stepped up with so many important goals from midfield.He grabbed both goals in the FA Cup final against Manchester United and he is such an incredibly tidy player. City are trying to keep him but it seems he will be on his way this summer. Barcelona have been linked anyway, but there will be stiff competition.  Another name that has been linked with almost every club under the sun over the past few months, Thuram would be a great option to provide depth in both the wide areas as well as upfront. The Frenchman is set to leave Borussia Monchengladbach this summer, with likes of AC Milan reportedly being interested in his services. With Barcelona seemingly keen to move on some forward players, Thuram could be a perfect replacement for the likes of Ferran Torres.  This is almost a combination of Ilkay Gundogan and Marcus Thuram. Roberto Firmino is a quality player who would undoubtedly be of serious use to Barcelona, and he also addresses a genuine needs in the squad too. It is not yet clear where Firmino is going to end up playing next season, but he still has so much to offer a top team in Europe. A player who has been destined to leave Lyon for a very long time now, various big clubs have been linked with a move for Moussa Dembele. If Barcelona can convince Dembele to be a deputy to Robert Lewandowski next season, they could have a very strong backup striker who can lighten the load on the Pole who, while still looking extremely fit, has to age at some point soon. 2022/23 has been something of a redemption arc for Adrien Rabiot. The midfielder was heavily ridiculed for his performances during the 2021/22 season, failing to score a single goal, but really turned a corner this past season and became a very, very good attacking midfielder.In what has been an incredibly tough season for Juventus, he has been one of their best players. Rabiot has contributed goals from midfield and his athleticism has really caught the eye too. Some height in midfield may be needed with Sergio Busquets out of the frame, and while Rabiot is not a Busquets-style player, Xavi could find an important role for him. Another Juventus player, Angel Di Maria endured a mixed campaign for the Bianconeri as he was limited by injuries and clearly struggled to thrive in Massimiliano Allegri's pragmatic system.Despite that, he did produce some really superb moments for Juventus in his one season at the club and was the driving force behind their run to the Europa League semi-finals. He would likely be able to give Barcelona one very good season while they do some planning for the future at the very least.  "
Alphonso Davies reveals details of failed Barcelona transfer,"Jun 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/alphonso-davies-reveals-details-of-failed-barcelona-transfer,"Davies joined Bayern for a then-record fee for an MLS player of $22m, joining from Vancouver Whitecaps in January 2019.  Since them, the Canadian international has become one of the best full-backs in the world, winning five Bundesliga titles, two DFB-Pokals and one UEFA Champions League during his time with the Bavarian club.  Speaking on podcast 'Say Less', Davies has revealed that he could have made a move to Catalunya instead of Bavaria afer leaving MLS footballer, saying that Barcelona approached him but ultimately then-president Josep Bartomeu renegged on the deal because of the player's nationality:  feed âBarcelona approached me but the president [Josep Bartomeu] didnât want me because Iâm from Canada. This was what the press said, I donât know if the President really said that, but Iâm not going to lie, it kind of crushed my feelings.â La Blaugrana are currently in the market for a full-back after the mutual termination of Jordi Alba's contract at the end of the 2022/23 season.  90min understands that the club are monitoring Joao Cancelo's situation at Manchester City and Bayern Munich. While Bayern are keen to keep hold of the Portuguese international, they are unwilling to pay anywhere near their â¬70m option to buy the player this summer thus potentially paving the way for Barca to swoop in and secure his services.

Following Saturday's final, Man City boss Pep Guardiola reserved special praise for Onana. ""When you have a goalkeeper like Onana who can read perfectly where everyone is to pass to, with [Hakan] Calhanoglu and [Nicolo] Barella, then the strikers hold it up and move the ball around. It is very, very difficult. It would be a tiny bit easier without this goalkeeper, but still very tough,"" Guardiola said in his post-match press conference."

Simons completed a return to his homeland last summer, signing for PSV and enjoying a breakout season back in the Netherlands, ending the campaign with 22 goals and 18 assists across 48 games in all competitions. The versatile forward - who is capable of playing on either wing, behind the striker or as a number nine - has made tremendous progress over the last 12 months and his development has not gone unnoticed. He played up front in PSV's 2-0 win against Arsenal in the Europa League group stage, while he started on the right in a 1-0 defeat at the Emirates Stadium. Reports from the Netherlands claim that Simons has drawn the attention of the Gunners, who are said to be contemplating a bid to take him off of PSV's hands already. feed Speaking to De Volkskrant, Simons was coy on his future at the Philips Stadion and admitted he needed time to think about his next move. ""I don't know yet. I'm now with the Dutch national team, I'm going to work here for two weeks and then we'll see what happens. Soon we will decide together with family what is best for me,"" Simons said.

However, sources have told 90min that the Gunners are currently unwilling to meet his Â£100m price tag, instead valuing him at around Â£90m. Other players on Arsenal's radar include former Barcelona winger Malcom and Manchester City full-back Joao Cancelo. Brighton's Moises Caicedo has continued to be linked with a move to the Emirates Stadium after Arsenal failed to sign him from the Seagulls back in January.

Mikel Arteta's side suffered in Saliba's absence, winning just five of their 11 Premier League games without him and ultimately falling behind Manchester City in the title race, underlying his importance to the team. Arsenal have already wrapped up the futures of Gabriel Martinelli, Bukayo Saka and Aaron Ramsdale, and tying Saliba down to a new deal will come as an enormous boost for Arteta's plans to keep his young core together.

Diaz would later return to Milan on a fresh two-year loan deal, during which he established himself as a key player for the Serie A side, winning the league title in 2021/22, and he has now returned to Spain to take up a role in Real Madrid's first team once again.

The Blues also have an option to extend his deal for a further year to help facilitate a loan move. feed Chelsea officials are keen to do some form of business with Milan, who were previously interested in a number of Blues players before Maldini's departure. Kalidou Koulibaly, Hakim Ziyech and Callum Hudson-Odoi were all on Milan's initial radar, as was Christian Pulisic, who has been offered around Serie A as Chelsea seek a permanent departure which would benefit everyone involved.

Other Premier League sides like Newcastle and West Ham are also monitoring the situation, though 90min understands Maguire is keen to battle for a more regular starting XI spot. United are keen to add another defender to their ranks and have held talks with Napoli's Kim Min-jae, who has a clause in his contract which allows him to leave for less than Â£50m at the start of July. If Maguire refuses to budge, United may change their transfer strategy in defence. feed Some club officials still hope to draft in another centre-back regardless of Maguire's stance or the future of Victor Lindelof. The Swede is known to have impressed Ten Hag in the backend of the season when Martinez and Varane were sidelined by injuries. Maguire is contracted at Man Utd until 2025 with the option of another year and his England credentials have not been harmed as of yet by his reduced playing time under Ten Hag. However, Three Lions manager Gareth Southgate admitted in May it would be difficult to keep picking the 30-year-old if he continues to go unused at Old Trafford. Maguire started eight Premier League games in 2022/23 and was a regular in United's cup XI both domestically and in the Europa League. "

An asking price of Â£100m has been placed on Rice's head and West Ham believe the midfielder could end up commanding a higher fee if a bidding war can be sparked. 90min understands Arsenal are wary of paying so much and instead value Rice at closer to Â£90m, and the Gunners would be looking to strike a deal that would see them pay an initial Â£80m with add-ons to take the price higher. feed That difference in valuation has left the door open for one of Rice's many suitors to come to the negotiating table, but sources have confirmed that Arsenal remain confident that they will win the race for Rice's signature. Those in charge at the Emirates Stadium believe Arsenal is Rice's preferred destination and there is confidence that will help the Gunners fend off any competition if a transfer battle arises. Despite not yet finding a side prepared to meet their demands, West Ham have conducted serious work in anticipation of losing Rice and have drawn up a shortlist of targets to pursue if and when they end up cashing in on their captain.

Declan Rice became just the third West Ham captain to hoist major silverware above his head, following in the footsteps of club legends Bobby Moore and Billy Bonds, but the game is expected to be his last in claret and blue amid a glut of Premier League interest. 90min understands West Ham are braced for bids to come in for Rice - Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United all interested in signing the 24-year-old who is valued at Â£100m - and majority owner David Sullivan revealed on Thursday the club had 'promised' to let him leave to further his ambitions.

West Ham are also considering making a bid for long-term target Kalvin Phillips, who has been unable to command regular first-team football at Manchester City. The 27-year-old penned a six-year contract when he joined in a deal worth Â£45m last summer but played just 291 minutes of Premier League football for the champions. An offer could also be forthcoming for Joao Palhinha, with his stock at an all-time high after an impressive debut season in the Premier League. The Portuguese international arrived at Fulham for just Â£20m last summer but his value has soared after a string of commanding performances in the heart of Marco Silva's midfield. West Ham will be able to offer Europa League football to any prospective new signing next season - their Europa Conference League winning exploits making up for a difficult Premier League campaign that yielded 20 defeats and a 14th place finish."

Chelsea and United, who have been following Martinez's career for years now, have registered their interest in a summer deal but they will have to fend off interest from Real Madrid if they are to bring him to the Premier League.

Chiefs in Saudi Arabia want to add more of Europe's elite talent to their ranks and sources have confirmed to 90min that Pogba is firmly on their radar. The 30-year-old has endured an injury and controversy-riddled campaign following his return to Juventus last summer from Manchester United. The Frenchman started just one Serie A game last season, while he was dropped from Juventus' squad for their Europa League knockout tie with Freiburg because of disciplinary issues' earlier in the year. Despite his struggles Pogba has insisted that he wants to remain in Turin and prove his worth, but Juve themselves have endured a tumultuous campaign beset with off-field controversies. Those ultimately spilled out on to the field in the form of a ten-point deduction for financial irregularities. manual Juventus are now looking at a potential rebuild this summer - they will play in the Europa Conference League qualifiers next year after missing out on Champions League and Europa League football - and that could lead to the potential departure of Pogba, who is one of their highest earners. The opportunity to offload Pogba to Saudi Arabia may prove to be tempting for Juve, while a potential transfer would be another significant coup for the Pro League. All of the big-name signings secured so far have been free transfers but with the nation's Public Investment Fund (PIF), who also own Newcastle United, pumping funds into the Pro League's top four clubs - Al Ittihad, Al Ahli, Al Nassr and Al Hilal - they will have no issues in paying substantial fees for any future targets. Benzema has moved to Saudi Arabia on a deal worth in excess of Â£250,000-a-day without tax - Kante will follow suit when he officially puts pen to paper - and Pogba can expect a similar pay day should he end up making the move to the Middle East."

Left-back has been a tricky position for Ancelotti. Usual starter Ferland Mendy has regularly struggled with injuries and, with the versatile David Alaba also sidelined for parts of last season, it was over to versatile midfielder Eduardo Camavinga to help out at the back. While Camavinga enjoyed some excellent run-outs at full-back, he has made it clear that he sees his future in his preferred position of midfield, and the arrival of Garcia should help the Frenchman stick to his favourite role.

Leicester are looking for a fee of between Â£55m and Â£60m for the two-cap England international, whose entourage has also been spoken to by Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal over the last six months, and it appears Spurs are now going head-to-head with Newcastle for his signature. The Magpies are considering moves for a number of players at the three teams who were relegated and still want Maddison, who was the subject of a failed Â£50m bid last summer. However, 90min understands they are reluctant to offer much more than that sum at this stage. feed Tottenham have now started negotiating with Leicester as they look to spruce up their midfield options. A lack of creativity hindered Spurs throughout the 2022/23 season before their embarrassing implosion, while Newcastle reached the Champions League thanks in part to the efforts of Bruno Guimaraes, Joelinton and Joe Willock. Spurs are ready to offer a salary comparable to star striker Harry Kane, while Newcastle would make him the joint-highest earner at the club alongside Guimaraes.. A move to Spurs would see Maddison link up more frequently with England captain Harry Kane. Both were included in the 2022 World Cup squad and are also in line to feature in Euro 2024 qualifiers against Malta and North Macedonia this month. Kane's own future has been the subject of fierce scrutiny with Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Manchester United among those keen, but 90min understands Tottenham have told the 29-year-old he will not leave north London this summer."
Karim Benzema reveals key factor in ditching Real Madrid for Al Ittihad,"Jun 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/karim-benzema-reveals-key-factor-ditching-real-madrid-al-ittihad,"The 35-year-old's decision to leave Real Madrid at the end of his contract shocked the footballing world, with many expecting the Frenchman to extend his stay at the Santiago Bernabeu by at least another 12 months. But after meeting with Real Madrid president Florentino Perez, Benzema opted to take up the offer of moving to Saudi Arabia, penning a three-year deal with champions Al Ittihad on Tuesday. Benzema's arrival could spark a mass exodus from Europe's top five leagues to Saudi Arabia, as a number of other high-profile players have also received lucrative offers. N'Golo Kante and Wilfried Zaha are close to joining Al Ittihad and Al Nassr respectively, while 90min understands Neymar's representatives have held talks over a move to the Middle East. Al Ittihad unveiled Benzema as their marquee new arrival on Thursday, where the 2022 Ballon d'Or winner admitted his religion had played a role in deciding his future. ""Well, because I'm muslim and this is a muslim country, and I have always wanted to live here,"" Benzema told the club's media channels. manual ""I'm so ready to show my talent in this new challenge, there are so many big names play here in this league - Cristiano Ronaldo and now me,"" he continued.  ""So, it's very important to show that Saudi football can have a global impact, because it's not only about playing well here, I should bring the success I managed to achieve in Europe and play the same way I used to do with Real Madrid. ""[Ronaldo] is my friend and he is here. It's amazing to see him here in Saudi Arabia, also he represents the new era of football in this country and the progress that's happening here, which is important on the international level."" Benzema previously indicated he planned on retiring at Real Madrid, but the unexpected opportunity to move to Saudi Arabia, where he will become one of the highest-paid players in world football, changed his plans after consulting with his family."
Liverpool director sends warning to Man Utd & Real Madrid over Harry Kane pursuit,"Jun 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-director-warning-man-utd-real-madrid-harry-kane,"Kane is set to enter the final 12 months of his contract with Spurs this summer and has attracted serious interest from Manchester United and Real Madrid, although 90min understands chairman Daniel Levy has made it clear he has no intentions of selling his star striker this summer regardless of how much money is offered. Even if Levy could be convinced to sell Kane, it would take an enormous transfer fee which would put Kane among the most expensive players in history - the sort of deal which Graham, Liverpool's director of research, believes would be a huge risk. Asked which club will end up signing Kane this summer, Graham told the Cheltenham Science Festival: ""A club that doesnât care about value for money."" Graham added: ""Heâs 29. Itâs going to be a high transfer fee for three years of performance that might start declining. feed ""From a data point of view, itâs magnificent the way Alex Ferguson constructed a team that was ageing just as he left [Manchester United]. It really did cement his legacy."" Kane has been told he will not be sold this summer as Spurs still hope to convince the striker to sign a contract extension next season before he is able to leave the club on a free transfer.  Graham, who will leave Liverpool this summer after 11 years as part of the club's transfer analysis team, also took the time to crush any slim hopes the Reds may have of landing long-time social media target Kylian Mbappe. ""Unfortunately, financially, out of Liverpoolâs league,"" he said of the Paris Saint-Germain forward."
Bayern Munich confirm signing of Konrad Laimer from RB Leipzig,"Jun 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-confirm-signing-konrad-laimer-rb-leipzig,"Laimer was a target for Premier League sides last summer as he approached the end of his contract in Leipzig but Bayern also lodged their interest and have been confident of wrapping up a deal for the Austria international for months. It has been one of the worst-kept secrets in football but now Bayern have finally made Laimer's move to Munich official, tying the 26-year-old down to a four-year contract. ""It's a dream come true for me,"" Laimer said after completing his move. ""FC Bayern is one of the biggest clubs in the world.  ""I will give everything for the club and the fans. FC Bayern always has the highest goals - just like me. I'm in the right place here. I'm only capable of giving 100%, and that's what I'll put into every training session from day one. I can hardly wait."" feed Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen added: ""We are delighted to have signed Konrad Laimer. He comes to us as a two-time DFB Cup winner - and together we will now hopefully celebrate many more great victories and titles here at FC Bayern."" Laimer becomes Bayern's first signing of the summer, and the Thomas Tuchel era, and could be followed by a new striker as the Bundesliga champions look to add more firepower in attack. Eintracht Frankfurt's Randal Kolo Muani is seen as a likely target, with Tottenham's Harry Kane expected to be too expensive, although the Frenchman has recently teased a potential move to the Premier League instead. Also heading to England from Germany could be Bayern right-back Benjamin Pavard who, with one year remaining on his contract, has made it clear he would like to leave this summer."
Football transfer rumours: Kane chooses next club; Real Madrid receive Valverde bid,"Jun 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/football-transfer-rumours-kane-next-club-real-madrid-valverde-9-6-23,manual
Newcastle ready to raid relegated Premier League clubs,"Jun 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/newcastle-ready-to-raid-relegated-premier-league-clubs,"The Magpies booked a place in next season's Champions League after securing a top-four Premier League finish - the first time they will have appeared in the competition for 20 years. Around Â£150m was spent on new players over the course of the 2022/23 season - Nick Pope, Sven Botman, Alexander Isak and Anthony Gordon among those to arrive - and sources have confirmed to 90min that the spending will continue to ensure the club remain competitive at a high level. Among the positions on the club's shopping list are a right-sided centre-back, a left-back, two central midfielders and a wide forward, and there's some potential bargains to be had from the teams who have been relegated not only from the Premier League but also from Europe's other top five leagues. The most high-profile targets are Leicester City duo James Maddison and Harvey Barnes, who have both been on the club's radar for a long time. The former was the subject of a Â£50m from Newcastle last summer, which was turned down, and he remains one of the club's priorities. Interest in Barnes was first reported by 90min in April - a result of his outstanding form in a Leicester side who eventually dropped out of the top-flight just two years after winning the FA Cup. The 25-year-old scored 13 Premier League goals during 2022/23 and is a two-footed player capable of cutting inside the full-back or driving to the byline. Tottenham will provide competition for both player's signatures, while West Ham and Aston Villa are also keen admirers of Barnes. Newcastle have also shown interest in a quintet of Southampton players who are likely to leave St Mary's this summer following their relegation. Captain James Ward-Prowse is perhaps the highest profile player of interest, while versatile full-back Kyle Walker-Peters is another who has garnered attention from some of the Premier League's top clubs. Teenage prodigy Romeo Lavia is another player being followed by Newcastle and a host of other top Premier League sides - 90min reported in April that the Saints will look to cash in on the Belgian. Enquiries have also been made over 20-year-old Argentine playmaker Carlos Alcaraz, who has been at Southampton for less than six months after joining from Racing Club, and 21-year-old centre-back Armel Bolla-Kotchap, who made his senior international debut for Germany last year. Alcaraz may cost Newcastle as much as Â£25m should they wish to pursue a deal - double what Southampton paid - while Bolla-Kotchap still has three years remaining on his contract. Leeds' demise from the Premier League is likely to see a number of their international players leave, with central midfielder Tyler Adams among those to have impressed Newcastle. The tenacious American was a key figure until a hamstring injury ended his season with 12 games remaining - Leeds picked up just eight points from a possible 36 without him in the side. Brenden Aaronson, Adams' international teammate with the United States, is another player admired by Newcastle, likewise Jack Harrison - the Magpies tried to sign him last summer but were unable to agree terms. He signed a new contract at Elland Road this year, after a deadline day move to Leicester fell through, but Newcastle may look to test Leeds' resolve with a summer bid. Newcastle have also been impressed by the versatility offered by Robin Koch, who can play in either central defence or just in front of the back four. The German international is just 26 and has been at Elland Road for three seasons. Another long-term Newcastle target relegated on the continent was teenage right-back Ivan Fresneda - a player the club have previously held talks with. His release clause of â¬40m has halved because of Real Valladolid's relegation from La Liga, but Arsenal, Aston Villa and Borussia Dortmund will provide stiff competition for the 18-year-old Spaniard's signature."
Xavi makes Barcelona summer transfer demand,"Jun 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/xavi-makes-barcelona-summer-transfer-demand,"Busquets is set to join Inter Miami, alongside former Camp Nou teammates Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez for a new challenge outside Europe. But he takes 15 years of experience and over 720 first-team appearances with him out of the club. With Gavi and Pedri continuing to both establish themselves among the next generation of global superstars, Xavi is looking to further develop his midfield off the back of La Liga glory this past season and a renewed Champions League title in 2023/24 after successive group stage exits. ""I lack [the] inside game [in midfield].Â The departure of Sergio Busquets is a big problem for me.Â Frenkie has stepped up, but I need creative players in midfield,"" the boss said. feed ""You have to go for a high-level substitute,"" he added on the need for depth. ""You have to prioritise if the club has financial problems.Â And the first is the pivot and the second is a play-maker.Â The rest we'll see how far we'll go."" Barcelona are hoping to sign Ilkay Gundogan on a free transfer this summer. His contract with Manchester City is due to expire this month and no fresh deal has been agreed. Gundogan's City teammate Bernardo Silva is another on the radar but could cost Â£75m. There have additionally been conversations regarding Joshua Kimmich, who is considering his Bayern Munich future after becoming unsettled. He still has another two years left on his contract at the Allianz Arena and could equally command a big fee as a result."
Jude Bellingham passes Real Madrid medical,"Jun 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jude-bellingham-passes-real-madrid-medical,"Los Blancos have agreed to pay an initial â¬100m, plus significant add-ons, to land the 19-year-old midfielder's signature, fending off competition from across Europe to get a deal done. Bellingham recently travelled to Madrid for medical checks, including tests on a knee injury which could rule him out of England's upcoming Euro 2024 qualifiers against Malta and North Macedonia. While a final decision on whether Bellingham may need surgery has not yet been taken, 90min understands that the teenager has now completed his medical exams and is one step closer to sealing his transfer from Germany to Spain. feed Real Madrid hope to be able to announce Bellingham's signing later this week ahead of a media presentation in the days that follow. With Bellingham's arrival inching closer to completion, Real Madrid can start to focus on their pressing need to recruit in attack after the quartet of Karim Benzema, Marco Asensio, Eden Hazard and Mariano Diaz all left the club on free transfers. Brahim Diaz has returned from his loan with AC Milan and is expected to sign a new contract ahead of taking a role in Carlo Ancelotti's first team. Elsewhere, Real Madrid are keen to sign Tottenham striker Harry Kane, whose asking price could prove difficult to meet following the signing of Bellingham, while they have also distanced themselves from Chelsea's Kai Havertz due to concerns about his valuation."
Neymar attracting interest from Saudi Arabia as Xavi rejects Barcelona return,"Jun 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/neymar-interest-saudi-arabia-xavi-rejects-barcelona-return,"The 31-year-old has two years remaining on his Paris Saint-Germain contract, with the Ligue 1 giants having the option to extend by a further 12 months. But the flamboyant Brazilian has been targeted by a section of PSG supporters who are disgruntled with his on-field performances and there were recent protests outside of his house by ultras demanding he leave the club this summer. 90min revealed at the beginning of May that Newcastle's owners, PIF, were exploring the possibility of taking Neymar to Tyneside - a potential first blockbuster signing in the North East as they build on the success of qualifying for next season's Champions League - and it's believed that he would prefer to remain in Europe if he leaves PSG. However, sources have confirmed to 90min that talks have been held with Neymar's representatives by a delegation representing the Saudi Pro League, who are interested in making him the next marquee arrival in the Middle East. Karim Benzema joined Al Ittihad from Real Madrid on a three-year deal on Tuesday, while N'Golo Kante and a host of other players are also being offered huge sums of money to follow in the footsteps of Cristiano Ronaldo, who joined Al Nassr at the back end of 2022 to elevate Saudi Arabia into the footballing limelight. feed 90min further understands that Neymar has been offered to Barcelona - who missed out on re-signing Lionel Messi after he opted to join Inter Miami - but manager Xavi has denied having any interest in re-signing him, telling Twitch channel Jijantes FC of the rumours: ""Iâm surprisedâ¦ heâs not in our plan.  ""I really like Ney as a friend, but we have different priorities."" Neymar previously spent four trophy-laden seasons at Camp Nou between 2013 and 2017, winning a famous treble in 2015, before making a world record â¬222m move to PSG. He has won a catalogue of Ligue 1 titles in the French capital, but has been unable to help PSG win a maiden Champions League crown despite playing alongside Messi and Kylian Mbappe for the last two seasons. Much of Neymar's time in Paris has actually been spent on the sidelines injured, with various ailments limiting him to just 112 Ligue 1 appearances in six full seasons at the club. Manchester United and Chelsea are also being kept informed over Neymar's situation, 90min can confirm, with PSG willing to sanction an exit this summer should they receive an offer in the region of Â£75m."
Chelsea consider double swoop for Moises Caicedo & Declan Rice,"Jun 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-consider-double-swoop-moises-caicedo-declan-rice,"With N'Golo Kante walking away on a free transfer to join Saudi Arabian side Al-Ittihad, Chelsea are prepared to lose at least four of their senior midfielders this summer. Alongside Kante, Mateo Kovacic and Ruben Loftus-Cheek are in talks over permanent moves to Manchester City and AC Milan, respectively, while Denis Zakaria has returned to Juventus after Chelsea declined to turn his loan into a permanent deal. As a result, midfield reinforcements are a high priority this summer and Chelsea, who have already missed out on the signing of Manuel Ugarte to Paris Saint-Germain, now have both Caicedo and Rice in their sights. 90min understands that Chelsea are pushing to strike a deal for Caicedo and have not yet ruled out launching a simultaneous move for Rice to bolster in midfield. feed The Blues are well aware of the level of interest in both players from elsewhere. Caicedo is high on the wish list of Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, who is also known to be keen to lure Rice to the Emirates Stadium this summer. The Gunners are understood to be leading the race for the England international. Manchester City, Manchester United and Bayern Munich are also monitoring Rice, who is expected to be the subject of significant bids now that West Ham's Europa Conference League campaign has come to a triumphant end. Rice is valued in excess of Â£100m and West Ham are prepared to stand firm on that figure. His current contract runs until 2024 but the Hammers have the option to extend that by a further 12 months. Brighton's demands for Caicedo are not expected to be as high, with an Â£80m fee thought to be enough to secure the signature of the Ecuador international."
Liverpool confirm shirt number for Alexis Mac Allister,"Jun 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-confirm-shirt-number-alexis-mac-allister,"The 24-year-old has arrived at Anfield on a long-term contract after rising to prominence with Brighton & Hove Albion over the past three seasons. Mac Allister also played a crucial role in Argentina's World Cup success last December, scoring the opening goal against Poland in a vital group stage win. He previously wore the number 10 shirt at the AMEX Stadium and will do so again on Merseyside, with the number vacant last season after Sadio Mane's surprise departure to Bayern Munich. The Senegalese international wore the number for four seasons after originally taking 19 upon his arrival from Southampton. Philippe Coutinho, Luis Garcia, Michael Owen and John Barnes are four recognisable names to have worn 10 since regular squad numbers were introduced, and manager Jurgen Klopp revealed to Liverpool's official website how much of a boost Mac Allister's signing is for the club. ""We are adding a very talented, very smart, very technically skilled boy to our squad and this is super news, really it is,"" Klopp said. ""I do not think the football world needs me to say too much about Alexis' qualities because they are already pretty well known but it is clear that he is someone who can play in a number of positions in the midfield and is an all-rounder, I would say. He is calm and composed and someone with proper game intelligence. feed ""My admiration and respect for what Brighton are doing is well known and Alexis has been a part of the journey that they have been on in becoming one of the toughest and best sides in the Premier League. ""I'm really happy his next steps will now be with us and we get to work with a player who is already excellent and experienced, but also has so much more to come given he is just 24 years old. ""He is just as excited to be joining and working with us and that already makes it a good partnership, but there is no pressure on him. He is still so young, so it is obvious he will only improve and our job is to help him take the next steps. ""I'm grateful to everyone at the club who helped make this transfer happen and I am sure I speak for everyone here when I say I cannot wait to start working with Alexis."" In addition to Mac Allister, 90min understands Liverpool hope to add a further two midfielders to their squad in a bid to challenge for next season's Premier League title. Manu Kone and Khephren Thuram are two players the club are actively in talks with over potential moves, although they do have a number of other transfer targets shortlisted. Outgoings wise, Roberto Firmino, Naby Keita, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and James Milner are leaving on free transfers, while there could be defensive casualties in a bid to freshen up Klopp's backline."
Arsenal willing to sell Jorginho & latest on Emile Smith Rowe future,"Jun 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-willing-to-sell-jorginho-latest-on-emile-smith-rowe-future,"The 31-year-old moved to the Emirates Stadium in January as Mikel Arteta looked to galvanise his squad for an unexpected push towards the Premier League title. Squad depth had been an issue for the Spaniard, who relied heavily on the likes of Thomas Partey, Granit Xhaka and Martin Odegaard in the first five months of the season, and Jorginho's experience of competing at the top level was seen as a welcome boost as Arsenal looked to shake off the relentless Manchester City. Jorginho dislodged Partey from his role as a deep-lying playmaker, making 14 appearances in total, but wasn't able to prevent Arsenal's incredible run of results from tailing off. They eventually finished as runners-up to City but remained comfortably ahead of Manchester United and Newcastle. However, Jorginho's signing was only ever seen as a short-term measure, and 90min understands that Arsenal will not stand in his way this summer should he have the chance to return to Italy. Former Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri, now in charge of Lazio, is keen to reunite with Jorginho at the Stadio Olimpico, and 90min understands that Serie A winners Napoli and Champions League semi-finalists AC Milan are also interested. Arsenal are not actively looking to force Jorginho out of the club but are acutely aware that they need to make space in their squad for incomings. Granit Xhaka is leaving the club to join Bayer Leverkusen and Albert Sambi Lokonga, whose loan spell at Crystal Palace didn't work out, is also likely to be moved on. Their exits could facilitate the arrivals of Declan Rice and Moises Caicedo, with Arsenal keen to sign both players despite their lofty price tags. West Ham captain Rice, who lifted the Europa Conference League on Wednesday night, wants to move on to further his ambitions but 90min understands the club will hold firm with their Â£100m vaulation. Chairman David Sullivan has at least confirmed he'll be leaving. As for Brighton, they may be willing to accept around Â£80m for Caicedo - a figure Arsenal were not prepared to way in the January transfer window. The Gunners may need to pull out all the stops this time round as big-spending Chelsea are interested in signing the pair for new head coach Mauricio Pochettino - they too have players to move on and a wage bill that needs significant trimming. feed Arsenal have no plans to sell attacking midfielder Emile Smith Rowe, 90min further understands, amid speculation over his future in north London. The 22-year-old signed a new five-year contract back in July 2021 and was handed the number ten shirt made famous by Dennis Bergkamp. A firm fans' favourite, he went to enjoy a superb 2021/22 campaign, scoring ten Premier League goals, but struggled to make an impact last season because of a groin injury that required surgery. Smith Rowe was then unable to dislodge Gabriel Martinelli from the starting lineup upon his return, and further competition for places was added when Leandro Trossard arrived from Brighton & Hove Albion in January. But despite playing just 161 minutes of Premier League football, sources have told 90min that Arsenal have no intention of selling and hope Smith Rowe, who was previously the subject of rejected bids from Aston Villa worth at least Â£25m, can recapture his best form next season. The Gunners are also finalising a contract extension for winger Reiss Nelson, who is set to sign a new long-term contract despite concerns of his own around game time."

Mac Allister underwent a successful medical on Tuesday, with Liverpool keen to tie up a deal for the talented Argentina before he went off on international duty later in the week, and the deal has now been confirmed. ""It feels amazing,"" said Mac Allister after completing his move to Anfield. ""Itâs a dream come true, itâs amazing to be here and I canât wait to get started.

Along with Mac Allister, Jurgen Klopp is also keen to add further midfielders to his squad this summer. 90min understands that the club have held talks with both Borussia Monchengladbach's Manu Kone and Nice's Khephren Thuram's representatives over a potential move to Anfield.  Mason Mount has also been linked with a move, although sources have confirmed that Manchester United are currently the frontrunners for his signature due to agreeing personal terms last week. "

Messi has instead joined MLS club Inter Miami, admitting in an interview with Mundo Deportivo and SPORT that the financial issues at Barcelona led to his decision. He said: ""I heard it was said La Liga had accepted that everything was fine for me to return, there were still many other things that had to be done.Â I heard that [Barcelona] had to sell players or lower player salaries and the truth is that I didn't want to go through that."" manual Speaking at a Kings League event, Messi's ex-teammate and Barcelona legend Pique lambasted his former club for the financial issues that led to the club missing out on signing the greatest footballer of all time. ""I'm glad I left because I gave BarÃ§a space on the salary scale. But it seems that, despite this, there are still financial problems. I wonder who should go now. They said that we are responsible for our salaries [Pique, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba]. ""Now, we've all left and yet they can't sign players [Lionel Messi]!"" Pique left Barcelona in December 2022, mutually terminating his contract to help the club financially.

After lifting the trophy, Rice insisted it was 'not goodbye yet' but now Sullivan has confirmed he believes the 24-year-old has played his final game for the club. ""I think it has to be [Rice's final game],"" Sullivan told talkSPORT. ""We promised him he could go. He set his heart on going. You can't ask for a man who has committed more to us this season. ""In due course, he has to get on and we have to get a replacement - or several replacements. feed ""It's not something we want to happen. We offered him Â£200,000-a-week 18 months ago.

Sullivan insisted West Ham are yet to receive any bids for Rice but, with their calendar now clear, he believes the bids will start flying in. ""I think the offers will start to come today,"" he continued. ""There are three or four clubs who have shown interest, but out of respect to West Ham, while we're still playing, you don't make offers for players. ""That's not the way decent clubs do things."" 90min understands that Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United are all interested in offering Rice a move across the Premier League, while Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich are also admirers."

West Ham have accepted they are likely to part ways with Rice this summer but are prepared to hold firm on their asking price of Â£100m - seen as a fair price for a player of Rice's age, ability and status as an England international. The pursuit of Rice is expected to accelerate drastically now that West Ham's season is over, with the midfielder previously keeping out of conversations over his future in order to keep his focus on the Europa Conference League final."

How Barcelona failed to re-sign Lionel Messi,"Jun 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/how-barcelona-failed-to-re-sign-lionel-messi,"The club was run into the ground under former president Josep Maria Bartomeu and major financial difficulties that are still hampering them meant Messi was forced to leave Camp Nou in 2021. That was strike one. After a few seasons at Paris Saint-Germain, Messi's contract expired and he headed into the summer of 2023 with a number of options for his next step. A lucrative offer came in from Saudi Arabia while Barcelona talked the talk but failed to put an offer to the 2022 World Cup winner. Despite a lot of public claims from president Joan Laporta and manager Xavi that BarÃ§a wanted Messi to return, they frequently put the ball in his court and his patience eventually waned, opting to move to the United States with Major League Soccer outfit Inter Miami instead. For BarÃ§a fans, that was strike two. But how did the Blaugrana fail to secure the return of their greatest ever player? Barcelona debts were spiralling in 2021 as their on-pitch results got worse and worse. The effects of the Covid-19 pandemic hit them hard, while the increasingly erratic financial handling and decision making of then president Bartomeu made things even worse. Players like Antoine Griezmann and Philippe Coutinho were signed for extraordinary sums all the while Messi's contract approached its expiry. Not enough money could be freed up to register a new deal that was already verbally agreed and Messi's departure was announced in a tearful press conference. PSG was then revealed as his next team, where he'd play alongside Neymar and Kylian Mbappe for two seasons. Messi signed a two-year contract with PSG but never fit fit the mould at Parc des Princes, despite his second season showing improvement after a disappointing first. BarÃ§a officials were never too far away from commenting on his future and the likes of Laporta and Xavi started making more noise about a homecoming in 2023. Laporta claimed Messi would return back in April when asked by Cadena SER and later added he had improved the club's relationship with the star forward. He said in May: ""We will do everything we can to bring Leo Messi back to Barcelona. ""I have spoken with Messi to address the situation. It was very nice. We have recovered our relationship. Messi wants BarÃ§a, he feels this club is his home, but speaking now would do him a disservice."" Xavi added he would find a way to add Messi into his 2022/23 La Liga title winners, but shortly after said the transfer would depend almost entirely on Messi - despite BarÃ§a's infamous financial difficulties. He said: ""Our fans started to mention Leo Messiâs name at every game...I like the feeling. But trust me, the comeback of Leo Messi only depends on him. ""I'd say that it depends 99% on Messi. I have no doubts on football point of view - it's up to Leo."" That ultimatum wasn't enough to drag Messi back to Camp Nou, as Inter Miami won the transfer battle in early June ahead of BarÃ§a and Saudi Arabian team Al-Hilal for his signature. Barcelona couldn't free up enough cash in line with La Liga's financial guidelines, so no formal offer was ever put to Messi despite their previous insistence and optimism that a deal could be struck. The idea of Messi moving to Inter Miami and then joining Barcelona on loan in the future has been mooted. It was an option club co-owner David Beckham used during his playing days, twice signing on loan for AC Milan from LA Galaxy during the MLS off-season. The regular season in America runs from February to October with the play-offs being played from October to December. Given Inter Miami are bottom of the Eastern Conference, a significant improvement would be required for Phil Neville's old side to get anywhere near the post-season. manual"
Barcelona respond to Lionel Messi transfer snub,"Jun 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-respond-lionel-messi-transfer-snub-inter-miami,"Messi publicly communicated his decision to Miami in an interview with two Barcelona-based newspapers on Wednesday night. In the process of taking his career to a brand new continent, he turned down the advances of his former team. Messi himself admitted that he was really keen to head back to Barcelona, but wasnât prepared for a repeat of the uncertainty that surrounded his 2021 exit. In its statement, the club also appears to have offered a slightly different version of events of what happened. Messi himself suggested that negotiations never got as far as being presented with a formal contract offer by Barcelona, which was part of the reason he looked elsewhere. Barcelona implied his reasons for turning down a return were different. feed âOn Monday, June 5, Jorge Messi, the playerâs father and representative, informed club president Joan Laporta of the player's decision to join Inter Miami, despite having been presented with a proposal from BarÃ§a, in consideration of the desire of both FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi for him to once again wear Blaugrana,â the Barcelona statement read. âPresident Laporta understood and respected Messi's decision to want to compete in a league with fewer demands, further away from the spotlight and the pressure he has been subject to in recent years. Both Joan Laporta and Jorge Messi also agreed to work together to promote a proper tribute from BarÃ§a fans to honor a footballer who has been, is, and always will be beloved by BarÃ§a.â The latter part seems to refer to Messiâs departure to Paris Saint-Germain two years ago coming at a time when he couldnât have a proper send-off, both due to the expectation that he would stay and fans not being able to attend games due to Covid-19 restrictions."
Lionel Messi reveals reason for not choosing Barcelona in transfer decision,"Jun 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/lionel-messi-reveals-reason-not-choosing-barcelona-transfer-decision-inter-miami,"The only reason Messi left Camp Nou at all in 2021 was because did not have the spending power to register his agreed contract. Now, with his time at PSG at an end two years on, he has chosen Inter Miami for his next chapter because he wasnât convinced that Barcelona wouldnât have the same issue all over again. ""I obviously really wanted to [return],"" Messi explained in a joint interview with Mundo Deportivo and SPORT, during which he revealed his decision to join Inter Miami. ""[I was] very excited to be able to return, but, on the other hand, after having experienced what I experienced and the exit I had [in 2021], I did not want to be in the same situation again: wait to see what would happen and leave my future in someone else's hands, so to speak. ""I wanted to make my own decision, thinking about myself, about my family.Â Although I heard it was said LaLiga had accepted that everything was fine for me to return, there were still many other things that had to be done.Â I heard that [Barcelona] had to sell players or lower player salaries and the truth is that I didn't want to go through that."" Already a 'bit tired', Messi added that La Liga had initially accepted things first time round in 2021 but it still proved to not be possible, which ended up with the player and his family in limbo in a Paris hotel. ""I wanted to make my own decision and that's why it was a bit that I didn't turn to BarÃ§a.Â Although I would have loved it, it couldn't [happen]."" He also explained that it wasn't a question of the money that was offered. feed ""We never even got to talk about the contract,"" he said. ""A proposal was passed over, but never a formal, written, signed proposal, because there was still nothing. There was the intention, but we couldn't advance anything, we didn't even talk about money formally. ""If it had been a matter of money I would have gone to Saudi Arabia or elsewhere.Â It seemed like a lot of money to me and the truth is that my decision was for the other side and not for money."" Barcelona president Joan Laporta had been particularly vocal about re-signing Messi in recent months. But while there were regular conversations with coach and former teammate Xavi, talks with Laporta happened 'once or twice at most'. Asked if he thought Barcelona had done everything possible to bring him back, 35-year-old replied: ""It is their issue. Many things were missing.Â The club, today, was not in a position to confirm 100% that I could return."" The point has already been raised that Messi could yet play for Barcelona again in the way that David Beckham, who is part-owner of Inter Miami, twice joined AC Milan on loan from LA Galaxy during MLS off-seasons. Some kind of ambassadorial role or secretary role was also put to him in the interview. Messi confirmed he would 'like to be close to the club' and will base his permanent family home in the city he has lived for more than half his life in retirement. ""I don't know when, but hopefully one day I can contribute something to the club and help because it is a club that I love as I always said.Â I appreciate the love I had from people during my career and I would like to be here again, yes,"" he explained."
Luis Suarez set to join Lionel Messi at Inter Miami,"Jun 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/luis-suarez-set-to-join-lionel-messi-inter-miami-mls,"90min confirmed on Wednesday that Lionel Messi would be joining Inter Miami this summer, where he would be joined by close friend Sergio Busquets. Now 90min can also confirm that veteran Uruguay star Suarez, who was very close with Messi at Camp Nou, will also be joining the Major League Soccer outfit going through a huge revamp. Messi is arriving on a free transfer after he ran down his contract at Paris Saint-Germain, and likewise Busquets comes in for nothing after leaving Barcelona at the end of the 2022/23 European season. Suarez has been with Brazilian side Gremio since last year following a stint in his homeland with Nacional. The 36-year-old is contracted to Gremio until 2024, but he has a release clause which he and Miami have activated and his signing will soon be confirmed. Suarez's arrival in south Florida will mean he returns to the same squad as Messi and Busquets for the first time since 2020, when he left Camp Nou for Atletico Madrid.  The trio spent six hugely successful years together in Catalonia and it is believed Messi has played his part in helping bring both his former colleagues to the club. feed"
Lionel Messi announces decision to join Inter Miami,"Jun 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/breaking-lionel-messi-announces-decision-join-inter-miami-mls,"Barca had been confident of re-signing the 35-year-old from Paris Saint-Germain for much of 2023, with Messi's father, Jorge, even stating that his son wanted to return to the club at which he scored a quite astonishing 672 goals in 778 appearances - both club records. Messi had also been offered an eye-watering â¬400m-a-year deal to join Saudi Pro League team Al Hilal this summer - a figure far greater than the amounts being paid to Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, who joined Al Ittihad on Tuesday. But it's Miami and Major League Soccer where Messi will be plying his trade next, with a blockbuster announcement from the player himself in a joint interview with Mundo Deportivo and SPORT confirming he will head to Florida to continue his career. ""I made the decision that I am going to go to Miami,"" Messi said. ""I still haven't closed it one hundred percent. I'm missing some things but we decided to continue the path."" ""I had offers from other European teams but I didn't even evaluate them because my idea was to go to Barcelona. If the Barcelona thing didn't work out, then leaving European football, much more after winning the World Cup, was what I needed. Finishing my career on this side and living the United States league in a different way, enjoying day to day much more but with the same responsibility of wanting to win and always doing things well, but with more peace of mind."" Inter Miami quickly followed up the release of Messi's interview in Spain with a video of their own, poking fun at the reports in recent months sceptical of MLS and linking him with Barcelona or a move to the Saudi Pro League. 90min revealed earlier on Wednesday that MLS and Inter Miami had sensed that there was an opportunity to poach Messi from under the noses of Barcelona, largely due to the financial packaged which involved payments from the league's largest commercial partners in Apple and adidas.  This will be the first time Messi has ever played senior football outside of Europe, having enjoyed 17 years in the Barcelona first-team before leaving for Paris Saint-Germain - where he won Ligue 1 in two consecutive seasons. Crucially, however, Messi wasn't able to lead PSG to a first Champions League success, despite playing in a dream front three alongside Kylian Mbappe and Neymar. feed"
Shirt numbers Lionel Messi could wear at Inter Miami,"Jun 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/shirt-numbers-lionel-messi-could-wear-inter-miami,"But Lionel Messi joining Inter Miami is on another level, rivalling when the late, great Pele joined the NASL revolution by signing for New York Cosmos in the 1970s. Messiâs presence in Miami will send the club global and promises to put more eyes on MLS than ever before. His shirt, just like it was at Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain, will immediately be one of the most popular that there is. feed Messi is most famous for his number 10 shirt. He wore the jersey at 13 years for Barcelona, from 2008 following the departure of Ronaldinho until he left the club himself in 2021. Upon joining PSG, the number 10 was already occupied by another superstar, Neymar. Instead, Messi was granted special permission to wear 30, a shirt usually reserved for goalkeepers in France. It was the shirt number that he had first worn when he broke into the Barcelona first-team in 2004. The only other number that Messi has worn in his senior club career to date is 19, which he took at Barcelona in 2005 ahead of his second season. He retained it for three years until switching to 10. Messi has also consistently worn numebr 10 at international level for Argentina since 2008, most notably when he lifted the 2022 World Cup as captain last year. The seven-time Ballon d'Or winner inherited the jersey from Juan Roman Riquelme, having previously worn a mixture of 18 and 19 for his country, as well as number 15 during the 2008 Olympics. Realistically, 10 is part of the Messi brand and he has no reason to take any other shirt at Inter Miami because it was vacated at the end of last year when Gonzalo Higuain retired. It has remained free since then, now nearing the halfway through the 2023 MLS season The MLS transfer deadline passed in late April, but the upcoming mid-season transfer window will open for new signings from 5 July. Although is set to be unveiled imminently, he won't be eligible to play until then, which perhaps suits him coming off the back of a full season in Europe."
Who will Arsenal sign this summer? Every player linked with the Gunners before the transfer window,"Jun 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/who-will-arsenal-sign-this-summer-every-player-linked-before-transfer-window,"A four-game winless run in April followed by back-to-back defeats in May allowed Manchester City to eventually waltz to their third-straight title after the Gunners had led the way for so long. Nevertheless, victory over Wolves on the final day ensured Mikel Arteta's exuberant outfit finished with their highest points tally since the Invincibles. Arteta's project is on the right track, that's for sure, but the club's stellar campaign will only raise expectations moving forward. Title challenges should become the norm, but only a huge summer transfer window will allow them to compete with City at the top next season. Here are the key positions Arsenal must strengthen ahead of the 2023/24 season and the players they've been linked with thus far. One must be capable of operating on the left side of Arteta's midfield three and adept at receiving possession between the lines in a more advanced role. The other, meanwhile, must take on the demanding holding midfield function. Although, Arteta took steps to ease the burden on his number six in possession by utilising Oleksandr Zinchenko as an inverted full-back.  Arsenal's priority midfield target is Declan Rice and the club will make a move for the England international after he leads West Ham out in the Europa Conference League final against Fiorentina. However, the Gunners face stiff competition from the likes of Manchester United, Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Man City for his signature, according to 90min. Moises Caicedo is also high on Arsenal's list of midfield targets, with 90min reporting Brighton are ready to listen to offers for the Ecuadorian. The Seagulls recently parted with Alexis Mac Allister for a meagre Â£35m and they're unlikely to be so generous when it comes to Caicedo. The Gunners are also keen on signing Man City pair Ilkay Gundogan and Joao Cancelo. Gundogan, who's a free agent this summer, has several options at his disposal and could yet extend his contract with the Cityzens. Cancelo, who spent the second half of the season on loan at Bayern, will return to City and 90min understands Arsenal along with Bayern and Barcelona are keen on signing the versatile full-back.  City, however, will not want to sell to the Gunners after letting Gabriel Jesus and Zinchenko fall into their lap last summer. A surprise name to keep an eye on in the coming weeks is former Barcelona flop Malcom. The Brazilian enjoyed a remarkable season with Zenit and has attracted plenty of interest from top European clubs. 90min believe Arsenal are one of the teams keen on signing the winger. feed With Aaron Ramsdale signing a new long-term extension and Matt Turner proving his worth as a number two, Arsenal are unlikely to make any alterations to their goalkeeper depth chart this summer.

Real Madrid reach agreement with Borussia Dortmund over Jude Bellingham,"Jun 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/real-madrid-reach-agreement-borussia-dortmund-jude-bellingham,"90min confirmed last month the deal between the two sides was close and an agreement is now in place. Real have agreed to pay an initial â¬100m plus adds-ons which could amount to 30% of that fee - sources have told 90min that Dortmund are 'very happy' with the agreement reached between the two parties which will make Bellingham the fourth most expensive player of all time. Bellingham is already in Madrid to undergo medical tests, allowing the England star to continue rehab on a knee issue which hampered the end to his season with Dortmund. The injury looks set to rule him out of the Three Lions' forthcoming Euro 2024 qualifiers against Malta and North Macedonia despite being included in Gareth Southgate's squad. manual The agreement between Real and Dortmund comes after contract terms were finalised with Bellingham at the beginning of May. The transfer is also welcome news for Bellingham's former club Birmingham, who are due around 5% of the deal."
Who will Man Utd sign this summer? Every player linked with the Red Devils before the transfer window,"Jun 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/who-will-man-utd-sign-this-summer-every-player-linked-before-transfer-window,"While the campaign ended on a bitter note as they fell to defeat in the FA Cup final to treble-chasers and crosstown rivals Manchester City, Erik ten Hag had already secured the club a piece of silverware and a swift return to the Champions League in his first season at the helm. However, the great Man Utd aspire to be much more than merely in their noisy neighbours' shadow. This term was undoubtedly an excellent starting point, but the Red Devils have a long way to go until they're competing with Pep Guardiola's Cityzens for the highest honours. A big summer beckons at Old Trafford with Ten Hag stressing the need for a busy window before his side's defeat at Wembley. Here's an overview of the key positions United need to strengthen and the players they've been linked with heading into the summer transfer window. You might argue that United need to strengthen across the board if they're to make a big leap in 2023/24. Sure, David de Gea may have ended the season with the Premier League's Golden Glove, but nobody would have said he was the best goalkeeper in the division. Errors continue to undermine his game and his sub-par work in possession means he's certainly vulnerable to losing his place next season to a shot-stopper more competent with the ball at his feet. De Gea's contract expires this summer, but the Spaniard is likely to pen a new deal. At the other end of the pitch, United essentially operated without an outright number nine for much of the season. With Anthony Martial often injured and Wout Weghorst proving an ineffectual addition, the goalscoring burden fell on the shoulders of Marcus Rashford, who performs better when darting in off the left. The Red Devils have a long list of striker targets this summer, and it's imperative that they snag one of their favoured options.  In terms of other priorities, it looks as if Man Utd will target a defender with the likes of Harry Maguire and Aaron Wan-Bissaka departing, while another midfielder, one capable of performing multiple functions, could be added to the club's arsenal with Marcel Sabitzer unlikely to continue at Old Trafford.  feed United typically play a leading role in the transfer market, and rumour mills love to link the club with a whole host of players from across the continent.  The club want to add two strikers to their ranks this summer - one young and the other established - but Karim Benzema's Real Madrid exit could compromise their pursuit of Kane. Vlahovic has told Juventus he wants to leave the club, while Atalanta want upwards of Â£50m for Hojlund's services.  Player Position Team Potential fee Diogo Costa GK Porto Â£65m David Raya GK Brentford Â£40m Emiliano Martinez GK Aston Villa Â£30m Player Position Team Potential fee Jurrien Timber RB/CB Ajax Â£45m Jules Kounde RB/CB Barcelona Â£70m Benjamin Pavard  RB/CB Bayern Munich Â£25m Kim Min-jae CB Napoli Â£55m Player Position Team Potential fee Mason Mount AM/CM Chelsea Â£50m Sofyan Amrabat DM Fiorentina Â£20m Declan Rice DM/CM West Ham Â£110m Adrien Rabiot CM Juventus Free Mohammed Kudus AM Ajax Â£45m Player Position Team Potential fee Harry Kane ST Tottenham Â£100m Victor Osimhen ST Napoli Â£95m Dusan Vlahovic ST Juventus Â£70m Rasmus Hojlund ST Atalanta Â£52m Randal Kolo-Muani ST Eintracht Frankfurt Â£85m Neymar LW/AM Paris Saint-Germain Â£60m"

If that bid doesn't entice the Blues, Brighton have also told Chelsea they'd be willing to consider offering midfielder Moises Caicedo in part-exchange for Colwill. Manager De Zerbi all but confirmed Caicedo is set to leave the club this summer after his side's final game of the season, with Chelsea, Man Utd, Arsenal and Man City all retaining an interest. 90min recently reported Brighton are willing to listen to offers for their star midfielder. Despite the Seagulls' strong interest in Colwill, Chelsea currently consider the defender 'unsellable' and are keen to see how he performs in pre-season. The player himself has told the Blues he wants to leave if he is not part of the the first-team, but the club has ensured him he is indeed part of Mauricio Pochettino's first-team plans heading into the 2023/24 season."
Man City preparing to make move for Real Madrid target Josko Gvardiol,"Jun 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-city-preparing-make-move-real-madrid-target-josko-gvardiol,"Gvardiol has emerged in recent months as one of the most highly-rated defenders in football following on from his performances at the 2022 World Cup. The left-footed centre-backÂ was close to joining Chelsea last summer, but the Blues failed to secure a deal with Leipzig. Chelsea do still hold an interest, yet without any European competition to offer 2023/24, they have little hope of persuading the player to move to Stamford Bridge. Gvardiol has a clause in his contract worth just shy of Â£100m that is due to kick in from 2024. But, as 90min revealed earlier this year, Leipzig are ready to take less than the figure to facilitate a move. feed Gvardiol himself knows he will virtually have his pick of clubs when he decides to leave and 90min understands that, as it stands, his preferred options are Manchester City and Real Madrid. City will make room in their squad with the sale of Spain international Aymeric Laporte, who has made it known he is ready to move and amid interest from clubs including Aston Villa and Tottenham. It remains to be seen if Real Madrid will push to do a deal this summer. Like City, Los Blancos are huge fans of Gvardiol and have been following him closely, but they have other needs and it is believed they want a new left-back ahead of a left-sided centre-back at this time."
N'Golo Kante close to joining Karim Benzema at Al Ittihad,"Jun 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/n-golo-kante-close-to-joining-karim-benzema-al-ittihad,"The 32-year-old is out of contract at Stamford Bridge this summer and has been in lengthy talks over an extension. There had been confidence in west London that Kante would ink fresh terms and prolong his stay at the club, despite interest from Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain. But 90min reported on Friday that Kante, who has struggled with numerous injury problems and was restricted to just seven Premier League appearances last season, had received an approach from the Middle East and was prepared to engage in talks to see what was on offer in Saudi Arabia. A meeting is understood to have taken place in London between Kante's representatives and a PIF delegation from Saudi Arabia, with an agreement now close on a blockbuster two-year contract that will see the Frenchman earn slightly less than his international teammate Benzema, who joined Al Ittihad on a three-year deal on Tuesday. 90min understands that the finishing touches are now being applied to the deal, which will end Kante's impressive eight-season stay in the Premier League. feed Regarded as one of the finest central midfielders of the modern era, Kante played a significant role in helping Leicester City achieve in the impossible in 2015/16, when they won the Premier League title, before replicating that success at Chelsea 12 months later. Kante also played significant roles in Chelsea's Europa League and Champions League successes in 2018/19 and 2020/21, while he has appeared in nine other cup finals for the club. His impending departure could be the first step of a dramatic makeover of Chelsea's bloated squad. New head coach Mauricio Pochettino has a number of decisions to make in terms of key personnel and 90min understands that Kante may not be the only departure from central midfield. Mateo Kovacic looks to be heading for the exit door, potentially to champions Manchester City, while Mason Mount's future at the club is uncertain amid interest from a number of Premier League rivals. The 24-year-old has agreed personal terms with Manchester United, though he could still remain in west London should Pochettino determine he's part of his long-term plans."
MLS & Inter Miami working on signing Lionel Messi ahead of Barcelona,"Jun 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/mls-inter-miami-working-on-signing-lionel-messi-ahead-of-barcelona,"The 35-year-old's departure from Paris Saint-Germain has been a long time coming, with many expecting a fairytale return to Barcelona to materialise despite the Catalan giants' ongoing financial difficulties. Messi's father, Jorge, has been in regular dialogue with president Joan Laporta over a return to Camp Nou and it's no secret that it's his preferred destination. Whether or not Barcelona are in a position to re-sign Messi remains to be seen, despite La Liga approving their financial viability plan. 90min understands that registering Gavi's new contract was the club's first order of business, while Ronald Araujo and Alejandro Balde's improved deals still need to be officially ratified. Multiple sources have confirmed to 90min that MLS and Inter Miami sense an opportunity to steal in and poach Messi, and there's increasing optimism that a deal can be agreed to take the star of last year's World Cup stateside. The package offered to Messi is expected to involve payments from MLS' two largest commercial partners, Apple and adidas - both of whom have the financial muscle to help match the potential earnings of a move back to Barcelona. There's even a possibility that Messi could join Inter Miami before heading back to Barcelona on loan - that would be one way of the Argentine having one last crack at winning the Champions League under Xavi before focusing on MLS for the final years of his career. manual Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal have also put a gargantuan offer on the table for Messi, which 90min revealed in May was understood to be worth more than â¬400m-a-year - significantly more than what Cristiano Ronaldo is earning at Al Nassr. There's no indication at this stage that Messi is looking to accept that offer, but the longer Barcelona have to drag their heels and iron out their financial plans, the more chance there is of the Argentine growing impatient. Were Messi to head to Saudi Arabia, he would join Karim Benzema as a marquee arrival in the Middle East - the Frenchman recently penned a three-year deal to join champions Al Ittihad from Real Madrid. N'Golo Kante and Wilfried Zaha are two other players closing in on a move to Saudi Arabia, with their respective Premier League careers appearing to be coming to an end after receiving huge contract proposals, and a raft of other huge names have been tipped to join Benzema in the not too distant future."

Real Madrid back away from Kai Havertz deal after learning Chelsea asking price,"Jun 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/real-madrid-kai-havertz-chelsea-asking-price,"The Spanish side have spoken with Havertz's representatives and have made it clear that they would be interested in a summer deal, with manager Carlo Ancelotti seeing the 23-year-old as the kind of versatile forward that could replace the departing duo of Eden Hazard and Marco Asensio. Chelsea are keen to keep Havertz this summer but 90min understands they would sell for the right price, such is their need to raise money after 12 months of immense spending failed to result in Champions League football. The Blues are believed to be keen to recoup the money they spent to sign Havertz in 2020, in excess of Â£70m, and sources have confirmed that Real Madrid have backed away from the negotiating table as things stand. Real Madrid officials do not share the same value of Havertz, who has two years remaining on his contract, and are not currently prepared to pursue a deal at that price. feed Despite the breakdown in negotiations, Havertz still has a real chance of leaving Chelsea this summer. Bayern Munich, led by former Blues boss Thomas Tuchel, are long-term admirers of the German and see him as a possible replacement for the ageing Thomas Muller. Paris Saint-Germain have also been alerted to Havertz's potential availability as they look to replace Lionel Messi. Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino has made it clear that Havertz still has a place in his team but, with Christopher Nkunku arriving this summer and plans in place to sign a new central striker, the Argentine is ready to sanction his departure. Real Madrid chased Havertz's signature back in 2020 before he ultimately opted for Chelsea and the German forward still has plenty of fans at the Santiago Bernabeu. Indeed, they may go back in for Havertz depending on how their pursuit of Tottenham striker Harry Kane works out - he has just one-year left on his contract and has been identified as Karim Benzema's potential successor."
David de Gea to shun Saudi Arabia interest and stay at Man Utd,"Jun 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/david-de-gea-shun-saudi-arabia-interest-stay-man-utd,"De Gea, the Premier League Golden Glove winner for the 2022/23 season, has been one of Erik ten Hag's most trusted players during his first season at Old Trafford. Ten Hag wants Man Utd to bring in competition for De Gea, but ever since arriving at Old Trafford in 2022, he has made it clear that he wants the Spaniard to sign a new deal. Terms with De Gea have been agreed in principle - as 90min revealed last month - and an announcement has been expected in order to confirm this new contract, but late interest from Saudi Arabia's Pro League threatened to complicate the situation. However, sources have told 90min that De Gea does not have a desire to leave Man Utd for the Middle East at this point of his career. Talks between Man Utd and De Gea have been harmonious from the off and there has never been any worry from either side about terms not being agreed, despite his current contract expiring at the end of this month. feed The one major issue to overcome was the fact De Gea has long been the club's highest earner on over Â£350,000-a-week. But the goalkeeper is taking a substantial pay cut to stay on at Old Trafford and confirmation of his new deal is expected at some point this month. Once De Gea's deal is finalised, Man Utd will look to bring in more competition between the sticks as they currently few backup options. Man Utd are considering promoting highly-rated young Czech goalkeeper Matej Kovar, who has impressed on loan at Sparta Prague this season. Jack Butland, who finished the season with Man Utd, has joined Rangers after his loan from Crystal Palace expired.

Zaha had, however, planned on prioritising a move to a club competing in the UEFA Champions League, with Atletico Madrid and Marseille prepared to offer him such a prospect. He has also been approached by Qatari outfit Al Sadd. But sources have told 90min that the contract on the table from Al Nassr has blown Zaha's other offers out of the water and they are confident of completing a deal. Should Zaha accept, he will become a teammate of Cristiano Ronaldo. Various high-profile players are swapping Europe for Saudi Arabia this summer. Karim Benzema's move to champions Al-Ittihad was confirmed on Tuesday evening, while Lionel Messi is still weighing up an offer from Al Hilal.

Sofyan Amrabat responds to Liverpool & Man Utd transfer links,"Jun 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/sofyan-amrabat-responds-liverpool-man-utd-transfer-links,"Amrabat announced himself to the footballing world as the defensive midfield linchpin behind Moroccoâs journey to the 2022 World Cup semi-finals in December. Those performances immediately put him in the shop window. 90min reported at the time that Liverpool and Tottenham were both interested in a January approach. Spurs were getting close to a deal, while Barcelona also made an ambitious loan offer. Manchester United are another club linked with the 26-year-old as part of their midfield rebuild. feed Amrabat is certainly open to the opportunity of heading to England, where older brother Nordin previously spent 18 months at Watford. But he is diplomatic, too, holding a strong admiration for both La Liga and Serie A as well. That being said, Amrabat thinks English football would 'suit' him. ""Of course, the Premier League is a fantastic league, one of the strongest in the world. It would be nice to play there one day, but itâs not that I want only to go to England, because Spain is nice, Serie A is a nice league,"" the player told The Times ahead of Fiorentinaâs Europa Conference League final.

Harry Maguire & Aymeric Laporte among Tottenham's top defensive targets,"Jun 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/harry-maguire-aymeric-laporte-tottenham-defensive-targets,"Spurs endured a miserable 2022/23 season, sacking head coach Antonio Conte and then interim boss Cristian Stellini down the final stretch of another campaign without a trophy. Their eighth-placed finish was the club's lowest since 2008/09, while Tottenham became the first team in 15 years to both score and concede more than 60 goals in a Premier League season. Understandably, Spurs have hopes of strengthening their defensive core ahead of the 2023/24 campaign. 90min understands that incoming boss Postecoglou has been consulted on the club's transfer plans and has given his approval to sign a new centre-back. manual Tottenham currently have three defenders at the top of their shortlist, with the standout name being Manchester United captain Harry Maguire. 90min reported in April that the England international has been offered to clubs in Serie A and that his preference should he leave Man Utd would be to a move to Italy. Manchester City's Aymeric Laporte, who lost his place as a regular starter during the 2022/23 season, is also high on Spurs' shortlist. 90min previously reported that Tottenham and PSG had been offered the chance to sign the Spain international this summer, though they have now been joined in the race by Aston Villa. Wolves' Max Kilman has long had admirers in north London and he remains a target for Tottenham."
Ange Postecoglou gives approval to Tottenham transfer plans,"Jun 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ange-postecoglou-tottenham-transfer-plans,"Postecoglou's move from Celtic to Spurs was confirmed on Tuesday morning, with the 57-year-old signing a four-year contract in north London. He will be the first Australian to ever manage in the Premier League. Though Postecoglou will officially begin work on July 1, he will be consulted on footballing operations throughout June and has already been given the lowdown on key areas that will look to be strengthened during the transfer window. 90min understands that Postecoglou is happy for Spurs to continue their pursuit of England midfielder James Maddison, who was relegated from the top-flight with Leicester City at the end of the 2022/23 season. At this stage, Tottenham are only in direct competition with Newcastle United for Maddison, though the Magpies can boast the lure of Champions League football next season. Club captain Hugo Lloris revealed last week that he plans to leave Spurs this summer and so Postecoglou agrees that a new starter is necessary. manual Brentford's David Raya remains high on Tottenham's shortlist, though they are reluctant to meet the Bees' public Â£40m price tag. The Spain international has just one year left to run on his contract and Brentford have already signed a successor in Netherlands stopper Mark Flekken.  90min previously reported that Inter's Andre Onana is an option for Tottenham and though this remains the case, rival interest from Chelsea will complicate any pursuit of the Cameroonian. At least one new centre-back is also a priority for Tottenham this summer, with Manchester United's Harry Maguire and Manchester City's Aymeric Laporte among their targets. Meanwhile, 90min understands that Celtic are fearful that Postecoglou will attempt to take some of his star players during his time at Parkhead down to England. The Hoops believe that striker Kyogo Furuhashi, winger Jota and midfielder Reo Hatate - who were all brought to Celtic during Postecoglou's tenure - could be subject of approaches by Spurs."
Aston Villa interested in Pau Torres and Aymeric Laporte ,"Jun 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/aston-villa-interested-pau-torres-aymeric-laporte,"The Villans enjoyed a hugely successful 2022/23 campaign under new manager Unai Emery, securing a place in next season's UEFA Europa Conference League. With European football secured and strong financial backing behind them, Villa have ambitious plans in the works for this summer's transfer window. They recently targeted Real Madrid winger Marco Asensio, who is leaving the club on a free transfer, but ultimately lost out to Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain. They are also keen to strengthen in central defence and sources have confirmed to 90min that Villarreal's Torres and Manchester City's Laporte are two names on their summer shopping list. Emery has previously worked with Torres at Villarreal, winning a Europa League title together during the former's time in charge, while Laporte has enjoyed extensive success with reigning Premier League champions Manchester City over the past five years. 90min understands that Villarreal have accepted that Torres is likely to leave the club this summer, and the 26-year-old does have a release clause worth around â¬50m in his contract. feed As for Laporte, he's found regular minutes hard to come by under Pep Guardiola this season, instead watching on as a combination of John Stones, Manuel Akanji and Nathan Ake have partnered Ruben Dias in central defence. The Cityzens have also switched to a fluid defensive system that sees Ake drift out to left-back and Stones into a defensive midfield role, further limiting the opportunities for Laporte to play. It's 90min's understanding that the Spaniard is looking to leave in order to play regular first team football, and that could be on offer not only at Villa but also at Tottenham. The Lilywhites are in the market for a new centre-back this summer having finally secured Ange Postecoglou as their head coach on a four-year contract. Laporte could be available for around Â£40m, having become City's record signing in January 2018 when he arrived from Athletic Club for a fee of Â£57m - his contractual release clause at the time."
Nottingham Forest in talks over permanent Dean Henderson transfer,"Jun 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/nottingham-forest-in-talks-permanent-dean-henderson-transfer,"Henderson spent the 2022/23 campaign on loan with Forest, which saw the club survive in the Premier League in their first top flight season for 23 years. The 26-year-old had previously earned a reputation as a top Premier League goalkeeper during time on loan with Sheffield United. But he was unable to displace David de Gea at Old Trafford when that spell came to an end, despite signing a bumper long-term contract in 2020. Henderson was a regular starter for Forest in the first half of his loan at the City Ground, only for a thigh injury in January to rule him out for several months. At that point, the club drafted in three-time Champions League winner Keylor Navas for the rest of the season. 90min understands that Forest had been waiting to see whether re-signing Navas would be viable. But the 36-year-old Costa Rican is set to have numerous offers to choose from amid interest from clubs in Europe, the Middle East, MLS and South America. feed Henderson has equally been waiting on the Navas situation as it is important to him to be a regular starter, rather than risk being a back-up. 90min understands that while talks between the clubs are not at an advanced stage, contact has been made and conversations are happening. Cumbria-born Henderson was 14 when he recruited by Manchester United after four years in the youth ranks at local club Carlisle. His first taste of senior football came during a loan with Stockport County shortly before turning 19, with further loans at Grimsby and Shrewsbury to follow. But it was when the goalkeeper was loaned to Sheffield United in the summer of 2018, still only 21 at the time, that his real opportunity came. Over two seasons, Henderson was a key part of the Blades team that earned promotion to the Premier League and then finished ninth in the top flight. Henderson returned to Manchester and played 26 times for his parent club across all competitions during the 2020/21 season, including an extended run ahead of De Gea in the Premier League. But he couldn't make it stick and fell almost completely out of favour in 2021/22."

""Itâs difficult to speak with so many emotions, but I want to say thank you to Real Madrid,"" he told the audience at his farewell presentation on Tuesday.

Chelsea enquire about AC Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan,"Jun 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-enquire-ac-milan-goalkeeper-mike-maignan-inter-andre-onana,"Milan are keen to strike a deal to sign Chelsea midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek and the two sides have been negotiating over the past few weeks with a view to a permanent deal which could be worth close to â¬20m. While at the negotiating table, sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea officials took the opportunity to bring up Maignan, who has established himself as one of the top goalkeepers on the planet since his move to San Siro in 2021. However, their approach was met with fierce resistance from Milan, who are not keen on parting ways with the 27-year-old French stopper this summer. The negotiations over Loftus-Cheek, which are progressing well, are understood to be separate to any talks over a hypothetical move for Maignan. feed Chelsea are big fans of Maignan, whose experience with both Milan and Lille has impressed the Blues on their search for a new starting goalkeeper. Scouts have also been impressed elsewhere in the city as Inter's Andre Onana is understood to be another key target. The Blues, as is the case with most of their targets this summer, are looking to drive down the price of any deal for Onana by offering to include a player in the deal, and 90min understands that centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly has been discussed. Chelsea have proposed sending Koulibaly to Inter on a loan with an option to buy and the Serie A side are understood to be satisfied with that proposal. Also leaving Chelsea could be Edouard Mendy, whose departure from Stamford Bridge is seen as more likely than that of Kepa Arrizabalaga, although both goalkeepers are understood to be available. The Blues are known admirers of Porto's Diogo Costa and Valencia's Giorgi Mamardashvili, but the experience of Maignan and Onana has given the Serie A duo the edge in Chelsea's estimations."
Real Madrid hold talks over Kai Havertz summer transfer,"Jun 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/real-madrid-hold-talks-kai-havertz-summer-transfer,"The Spanish side are looking to bolster their forward line this summer after confirming the departures of Karim Benzema, Marco Asensio, Eden Hazard and Mariano Diaz, and Havertz is seen as an affordable, high-level option. Tottenham striker Harry Kane has been earmarked as the preferred replacement for Benzema, with Real officials instead seeing Havertz as the versatile forward who could fill Hazard's spot in the squad. Havertz will enter the final two years of his contract this summer and Chelsea, who are reluctant to see any player arrive at such a point in their deal, have made it clear that he does still have a future at the club. However, 90min understands that Chelsea officials are well aware of the need to sell players to raise money this summer and Havertz, who is among the club's highest earners, could well be sold if he indicates a desire to leave the club. feed New Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino, while being open to working with Havertz, is prepared to sanction the 23-year-old's departure if the right deal arises, and there are plenty of interested sides across Europe. As revealed in March, Bayern Munich are keen to land Havertz, but Real Madrid have also held conversations with the German's representatives in the past week and are understood to hold a significant interest in luring him to the Santiago Bernabeu. 90min understands that Paris Saint-Germain have also been alerted to the possibility of a summer exit for Havertz, whose chances of leaving Chelsea are growing with the mounting interest in his services. Havertz has made 139 appearances for Chelsea since joining in the summer of 2020, lining up largely as the team's central striker, but the Blues are looking for reinforcements in that position this summer and have identified Napoli's Victor Osimhen as their dream signing.

Speaking to The Guardian after his Barcelona exit, Busquets admitted that he does not want to play for another European club because he would not want to play against his boyhood club.  ""I still don't have plans, honestly. I do have three or four options but nothing is done.

Karim Benzema agrees Al-Ittihad contract,"Jun 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/karim-benzema-agrees-al-ittihad-contract,"Benzema called time on his Real Madrid career earlier this month, bringing an end to his 14-year association with Los Blancos and going out in suitable fashion with a goal in the 1-1 draw with Athletic Club to close out the 2022/23 La Liga season. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Benzema is now set to take his talents to Saudi Arabia, where Al-Ittihad have agreed the terms of a three-year deal with the veteran striker. Real Madrid will host a farewell event for Benzema on Tuesday, after which the 35-year-old's move to Al-Ittihad is expected to be announced.

The Celtic players Ange Postecoglou could take to Tottenham,"Jun 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/the-celtic-players-ange-postecoglou-could-take-to-tottenham,"After Arne Slot seemingly used the club's interest as leverage in contract negotiations with Feyenoord, Tottenham threatened to endure another torturous managerial search as was the case in 2021.  Spurs' search two summers ago was nothing short of a joke, and while some supporters aren't best pleased with the route they've gone down this time around, at least they've got their new boss in before the summer transfer window opens for business.  While a very likeable bloke and potentially the facilitator of a brand of football Spurs supporters desire, there's no denying the risks with appointing Postecoglou given the sheer enormity of the task that awaits the 57-year-old Australian.  Time and patience is necessary among the fanbase with a difficult road ahead, and Postecoglou may seek familiarity in a bid to ease his transition into the Premier League. Here are four Celtic players he could bring with him to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this summer.  feed Ange has been wedded to a 4-3-3 since he joined Yokohama F. Marinos in 2018, and we should expect the Australian to adopt a similar system in north London.However, with Rodrigo Bentancur recovering from an ACL tear, there are currently few midfielders within the Spurs squad capable of excelling as a box-to-box number eight. You might argue that the two best suited to the roles, Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso, are destined to be moved on this summer. There are alternate options, such as Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Pape Matar Sarr, but Postecoglou might try and reunite with converted forward Hatate, who was arguably the most impressive performer in the Scottish top flight during the Australian's two years at Celtic Park.  With Lucas Moura moving on and Bryan Gil's future uncertain, Spurs require depth in wide areas - even more so if Harry Kane departs and Richarlison is tasked with replacing him up top.Thus, a possible familiar option for Postecoglou is Jota, who dazzled during the big man's two years at Celtic. The Benfica academy graduate has notched 41 Scottish Premiership goal contributions in 62 appearances. The 24-year-old is adept off both flanks and perhaps ready for a step up in standard after standing out in Scotland. His playmaking capacity is equally impressive as his goalscoring, and a move to Spurs would allow him to reunite with the boss that got the very best out of him. The club's current options mean Jota wouldn't be expected to claim a starting role right away either.   Cameron Carter-Vickers' success in the Scottish top flight points towards a major drop in standard compared to the Premier League, and many Spurs supporters will undoubtedly turn their noses up at the prospect of signing CCV's steady centre-back partner. Tottenham are in dire need of defensive reinforcements, and a left sided defender is of paramount importance. Clement Lenglet could join the club permanently, but Postecoglou needs much more. Starfelt is by no means a superstar, far from it, and his signing would make little sense if Lenglet was to sign a multi-year deal. The Swede could be a serviceable back-up, though, after shining at Celtic Park during Ange's two seasons at the club. The 28-year-old is a progressive ball player, but his experience at the highest level is minimal. The former Vissel Kobe hitman is another Japanese international who's taken to the Scottish Premiership like a duck to water. After a modest start to life at Celtic Park, Kyogo ended the 2022/23 campaign as the league's top scorer; netting an impressive 27 times in 36 games. The seasoned striker is a remarkably intelligent forward who excels off the ball. His movement helps him get into optimal scoring positions, and he's usually clinical in front of goal - although he did slightly underperform his xG this season. Kyogo certainly appears ready for a big move, but the 28-year-old is far from a ready-made Harry Kane replacement. Like Jota and Starfelt, he'd be much more suited to initially playing a less prominent role if Ange was to bring him to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. "
Sergio Ramos urges Harry Kane to choose Real Madrid over Man Utd,"Jun 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/sergio-ramos-harry-kane-choose-real-madrid-over-man-utd,"Kane is about to enter the final year of the long-term Spurs contract he signed back in 2018.

Other options in Madrid include the aforementioned Osimhen, as well as Kai Havertz and Joselu. Ramos, who spent 16 years at Real and infamously resisted the chance to join Manchester United in 2015, has warned Kane against rebuffing the chance to join Real. ""My advice to any player is don't turn down the opportunity to play forÂ Real Madrid â it is a special club who know how to win,"" the centre-back explained. ""[Kane] has an incredible physical presence, you can't score as many goals as he does in theÂ Premier LeagueÂ and not be able to play the physical side of the game. But he can also play the technical side of the game as well and I don't think he gets enough credit for that. ""Yes, he is a great goal scorer but he is also a great football player as well."""

Jorge later confirmed to Jijantes FC that, with Barcelona's financial viability plan expected to be approved by La Liga, a final decision on Messi's future will be made imminently. ""The decision will be known this Tuesday or Wednesday,"" Jorge confirmed. feed Jorge later admitted that 'it is difficult' to say where Messi would be playing next season and stressed that a return to Barcelona hinges solely on whether the La Liga champions can actually afford to offer him a contract. Barcelona have exceeded their salary cap and have been banned from adding any extra salary by La Liga, who have received a viability plan from the Blaugrana in an attempt to gain permission to make moves this summer. 90min understands that their transfer wishes are expected to be given the green light imminently but Barcelona do have plenty of other business to attend to. Registering the contracts of Gavi and Ronald Araujo, whose senior extensions are still technically not official, remains a high priority as well. Once a final decision on Messi's future has been made, Barcelona also plan to recruit centre-back Inigo Martinez, who will leave Athletic Club as a free agent this summer, and they also want to sign Manchester City captain Ilkay Gundogan on a free transfer."

Erling Haaland contract: Man City pushing to remove clauses & agree new deal,"Jun 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/erling-haaland-contract-man-city-clauses-new-deal,"The 22-year-old arrived at the Etihad Stadium last summer in a bargain deal worth just over Â£50m, thanks to a release clause in his contract at Borussia Dortmund. Haaland has more than paid back the fee with a series of stunning performances during his debut campaign, and has registered an incredible 52 goals in all competitions at a rate of one goal per game. 36 of those goals came in City's successful Premier League title defence - a record for most goals scored in a single season - en route to collecting the Golden Boot, Player of the Season and Young Player of the Season awards. As well scooping those individual accolades, Haaland has helped City to the brink of a famous treble - Saturday's UEFA Champions League final against Inter on Saturday the missing piece of the jigsaw after the FA Cup final win over Manchester United last weekend. 90min revealed in March that City were keen to reward Haaland with a new contract, not only to reward his outstanding performances but also to remove a number of clauses that were inserted into the deal - with one in particular believed to stipulate that the Norwegian can leave should a certain figure be offered to City. Not all of the clauses in Haaland's contract are active - there's one that is believed to involve the future of Pep Guardiola as manager - but 90min understands that City remain keen on negotiating a new deal to prevent them becoming live in the future. The player's representatives, however, do not see the need to remove them at this time. Indeed, Haaland's agent, Rafaela Pimenta, explained to Spanish publication AS last year why the clauses are crucial to her client's contract. manual âWhen a player goes to a club, I do all I can to create a situation where the key is in their hands,"" Pimenta said. ""If tomorrow you donât want to be there anymore because you donât like it, or if they donât pay you well, or if your wide wants to live in Paris, well, you go, no? I donât like it when the player has no freedom to decide. I have done all the contracts in this agency in 25 years. All of them. There wasnât a single time when a player said âI want to goâ and they could not do it. âFor me,Â HaalandÂ is worth a billion, no one is going to pay that, but itâs the potential that he has when he arrives at a club. He brings with him fans, goals, results, professionalism, digital content, notoriety, sponsors...if you put all that together, his value includes a lot of things. âBut the price of a footballer, in reality, is set by a club. I know that no one is going to pay 700m for one player, but itâs very clear that Erlingâs value when he arrives at a club is immense, itâs at least a billion.â Pimenta added to the mystery of a potential release clause in a recent interview with Mundo Deportivo and has previously spoken about a move to Real Madrid amid links to the Santiago Bernabeu. The Spaniards are unexpectedly searching for a new centre forward after Karim Benzema opted to end his 14-year stay in the Spanish capital in favour of a move to Saudi Arabia, and Haaland is a known long-term target for the club alongside Kylian Mbappe and Harry Kane. Kane is expected to be the striker Real make a move for now, with Haaland's future at City likely secure in the short-term given the success of his first season in Manchester."

West Ham braced for opening bids for Declan Rice,"Jun 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-braced-for-opening-bids-for-declan-rice,"The Hammers will appear in their first major European final for 47 years on Wednesday looking to win their first trophy of any kind since 1980, when they surprisingly beat Arsenal 1-0, as a second division side, to lift the FA Cup at Wembley. David Moyes' side were disappointing in the Premier League during 2022/23, losing 20 of their 38 games to finish 14th in the table, but have been excellent in Europe, overcoming Gent and AZ Alkmaar in the knockout stages of the Conference League to book their place in Prague. Central to their run to the final has been Rice, whose long-term future has dominated the build-up to the game. Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United all hold significant interest in the 24-year-old, as do Bayern Munich - Bundesliga champions for the last 11 seasons. West Ham have accepted that Rice, who has two years remaining on his contract, is likely to leave London Stadium this summer and have been preparing for his eventual departure for some time. But they are also determined to hold firm in their valuation of Rice and will not settle for anything less than Â£100m - either that price is met or a deal will not be agreed. The club expect bids for Rice to come in straight after Wednesday's final, sources have confirmed to 90min, but it remains to be seen whether Arsenal, Chelsea or any other interested party are willing to immediately pay the price West Ham are looking for. 90min has reported extensively on Rice's potential next steps, revealing that new Chelsea head coach Mauricio Pochettino is keen on the England international in addition to detailing Manchester City's renewed interest. Arsenal's pursuit of Rice, and their desire to strengthen Mikel Arteta's midfield options, has also been well documented. feed The surprise interest of Bayern Munich has stolen the headlines for the past week, while noises continue to be made over a potential late move from Manchester United. The Red Devils are in the market for new midfielders - personal terms have already been agreed with Chelsea's Mason Mount - and manager Erik ten Hag is believed to be impressed with Rice's all-around game. Rice has publicly stated his ambition to play in the Champions League and compete for trophies, and it's unlikely that a West Ham win against Fiorentina - which would book a place in next season's Europa League - will be enough to keep him at the club. And though money is not a factor in Rice's decision making, it's clear that his growing stature and reputation - one that has been enhanced by the interest of so many clubs - could command a significant wage packet that West Ham simply aren't able to afford. As it stands, Rice has not made it clear if he has a preferred destination, despite talk of the player wanting to remain in London to be . Furthermore, he is leaving talks over his future to his family and representatives while he focuses on leading West Ham out against Fiorentina."

Midfielder Gavi and centre-back Ronald Araujo both agreed long-term extensions months ago but Barcelona's attempts to register those deals were blocked by La Liga, who banned the club from adding to their salary while they were already over their cap. Since then, Barcelona have been working tirelessly behind the scenes to prove to La Liga that they can afford their plans, with the recent departures of both Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba going a long way to help that cause. Registering Gavi and Araujo's extensions is high on the list of priorities for Barcelona who, once negotiations with Messi come to an end, will also begin pursuing a number of other transfer targets. Athletic Club's Inigo Martinez could join after confirming his departure from the Basque side this summer, while Manchester City duo Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gundogan are also targets for Barcelona."

""Real Madrid wants to express its affection for Eden Hazard and wishes him and his entire family the best of luck in this new stage."" feed Real Madrid will end their season against Athletic Club on Sunday, with Hazard heading into the game having racked up just 76 appearances in all competitions for Los Blancos. The 32-year-old winger, who is one of Real's top earners, has contributed seven goals and 12 assists during his time in Spain, which quickly turned into a nightmare after Hazard suffered a foot injury early into his debut season. Several surgeries failed to bring Hazard back to his best form and, by the time he had managed to shake off the injury bug, he had lost the majority of the faith from those in charge at the Bernabeu and struggled for game time. The former Chelsea winger has appeared just six times in La Liga this season, despite only being unavailable for three matches through injury, and is now just weeks away from bringing his disasterous spell in Spain to an abrupt end."
Sergio Ramos: Potential destinations as former Real Madrid star confirms PSG departure,"Jun 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/sergio-ramos-potential-destinations-former-real-madrid-star-confirms-psg-departure,"However, when the time comes to parse through Ramos' glittering career, the two years he spent at Paris Saint-Germain will serve as little more than a forgotten footnote. Ramos almost had his deal terminated after limping through his first three months in Paris on the sidelines. The centre-back's second appearance for the club, in December, brought a trademark red card. Once fit enough to be a regular, Ramos couldn't transpose his Champions League-winning pedigree onto the dysfunctional unit, failing to preside over a single clean sheet in European competition. With 37 years and almost as many titles to his name, Ramos could live up to his pirate aesthetic and happily sail off into the sunset. Yet, while signing off at PSG he promised: ""I will face new challenges, I will wear other colours."" Here are some possible shades Ramos could don next season. Cristiano Ronaldo's view of Middle Eastern football has dramatically changed over the course of six months. After distancing himself from a move to Saudi Arabia in his infamous interview with Piers Morgan, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner is now calling for ""big players and big names"" to join him in the kingdom.Ramos played 340 matches alongside Ronaldo at Real Madrid but endured a complicated relationship with the demanding forward. Contact between the duo has been limited since Ronaldo joined Juventus in 2018 but they could be reunited at Al Nassr this summer. Ronaldo may have propelled Al Nassr to prominence following his arrival but Al Hilal are Saudi Arabia's traditional elite.In the midst of a transfer ban when Ronaldo arrived at Al Nassr after the winter World Cup, Al Hilal have relentlessly been linked with a gargantuan move for Lionel Messi, who is following Ramos out of the door at PSG this summer.Reports in France speak of an offer to quadruple Ramos' PSG wages - which were hardly insignificant - should he join on a free transfer this summer. With the Saudi top flight targeting as many as 20 high-profile players in the division next season, Ramos could be one of the arrivals. feed Inter Miami have been sniffing around Ramos since he entered the final months of his penultimate contract with Real Madrid in 2020. Three years on, the rugged centre-back isn't quite at the heights of that La Liga-winning vintage but whispers of a move to David Beckham's Inter persist.Beckham's former club LA Galaxy are also supposedly interested in the 37-year-old. Both clubs have made dire starts to the MLS season, with Inter propping up the Eastern Conference and Galaxy recording the worst defensive record in the western half of the division. 18-year-old Sergio Ramos for Sevilla during 2004/2005 season:â37 gamesâ½ï¸3 goalsâï¸14 clean sheetsGenerational talent. Beginning of a legend. pic.twitter.com/Ecl3KfQy0d When Ramos' mum warned him off following his first passion - bullfighting - he channelled his exuberance into football, rapidly rising through the ranks at Sevilla.Ramos only spent one full season in the senior side before joining Real Madrid, systematically eroding all of the good faith he had built during his time as a precocious teenager in Andalusia. As recently as March 2023, Sevilla had part of their stadium closed as a delayed punishment for abuse that the fans dished out to Ramos in 2017.However, there have been tentative rumours of a return to Spain for Ramos this summer. Victory in the Europa League final, and the prospect of Champions League football next season, makes Sevilla a more attractive destination but Ramos would have to stomach a hefty pay cut. After Real Madrid president Florentino Perez supposedly denied Ramos a lucrative move to China in 2019, the centre-back diplomatically outlined the bond between the two strong characters.""The president and I have a father-son relationship,"" Ramos said, ""we love each other a lot, the friction produces love."" However, in the intervening years, the love appears to have faded while the friction has increased.Putting aside the relationship between Perez and Ramos, Real Madrid have been uncharacteristically frugal in recent years, pinching the pennies and prioritising youth.While it would be a romantic return to the club that he captained to so much success, it remains unlikely."

Lloris does still have one year remaining on his contract but he confirmed to Nice Matin that he hopes to find an agreement to leave Spurs this summer and bring his 11-year association with the club to an end. ""We are coming to an important moment, for the club or for me,"" he began. ""It's the end of an era. I have desires for other things. ""I will ask myself to study what is possible, but I don't forget that I still have one year left on my contract with Tottenham and that, in football, it is always difficult to predict what will happen.

""My goal is to recover in July, then we'll see what the future holds for me."" feed Asked about links with a possible move to Saudi Arabia, Lloris appeared to stress he believes he is good enough to remain in Europe. ""You can't go from a successful World Cup to being an average player in a few months,"" the goalkeeper insisted. ""I had a few hard knocks, I was a little inconsistent in my performance, I got injured twice. I came out of the World Cup pretty dull. The pace had been hellish before that.  ""This is the first time in my career that I am unavailable. But I'm good in my head, in my body. This period will bring me freshness to still make me happy with my performance, my work. The most important thing is to find a project in which I flourish."" Lloris made 31 appearances in all competitions for Tottenham this season, with injury problems adding to what was a frustrating campaign for everyone at the club. ""It's not what we hoped for as a team,"" the Frenchman conceded. ""We made it halfway through the season rather well, in the Premier League and the Champions League. During the second part of the season, we experienced a lot of hard knocks on the collective level but also on the individual level with two injuries.  ""We failed as a team by not being able to reverse the course of things. It's disappointing but it's part of the life of a top-level football club. The most important thing is to prepare as well as possible for next season and to learn from our mistakes."""

As for PSG, Messi is not the only superstar leaving the club this summer as Sergio Ramos' departure from the Parc des Princes was confirmed on Friday. Ramos joined PSG on a free transfer just weeks before Messi's own move to France and the duo's departures will leave a significant whole in the first team which club officials are already working to fill.

Their pursuit of the 24-year-old is hardly a secret, but Liverpool fans have at least received some reassurance from a member of his family that a deal will soon be done.

Carlo Ancelotti discusses Harry Kane transfer links,"Jun 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/carlo-ancelotti-discusses-harry-kane-transfer-links,"90min revealed earlier this week that Europe's top clubs believe that Kane, who only has one year left to run on his contract, will not leave Spurs this summer. Nevertheless, the likes of Real Madrid remain keen on a deal and could step up their efforts to pry him away from his boyhood club. Karim Benzema was expected to accept an offer to join Saudi Pro League champions Al Ittihad earlier this week, but he changed his mind at the last minute and will remain in the Spanish capital for one more season at least. However, Real Madrid may still look to bring in a new striker during the summer transfer window regardless, with their pursuit of Kane becoming front-page news in Spain on Saturday. At a press conference ahead of their final game of the season against Athletic Club, Ancelotti was asked about Kane. feed ""'I'm sure you all are curious to see what will happen next season,"" he replied. ""I'm not going to talk about the future of the squad. Kane is a top player, but we have to respect Tottenham, he is a Tottenham player. ""I can guarantee to you that Real Madrid will have a competitive team again next season."" Real Madrid and Tottenham have both had subpar seasons by their own standards. While Los Blancos did win the Copa del Rey for the first time since 2013/14, they fell short in their defences of La Liga and the Champions League. Barcelona beat them to the Spanish title with staggering ease, while Manchester City tore them apart in the semi-finals of their European Cup defence. Spurs, meanwhile, came eighth in the Premier League, their lowest finish in 15 years, and failed to win a trophy for a 15th successive season.

However, he then fielded an offer from Saudi Arabia's Pro League to join new champions Al-Ittihad on a two-year deal that would have been worth â¬200m. Benzema conveyed the news he was leaving to president Florentino Perez in a meeting on Thursday, during which the Real supremo made it clear they wanted him to stay. But the Frenchman at that point had decided to end his Madrid career after 14 years. feed However, sources have now told 90min that further meetings have been held, at which Benzema decided he would indeed stay for another season at the Santiago Bernabeu. Whilst Real were shocked and had not planned for Benzema's departure, their transfer team headed by Juni Calafat was already working on potential replacements - which was headed by Harry Kane However, Benzema's decision now means Real can again focus on other areas of their squad, which includes finalising a deal for England star Jude Bellingham."

Benzema was honoured at an event on Thursday night with the Marca Legend award. During a Q&A session on stage, he was asked about his future, but instead pointed to the fact that there is still one more game of the season to play in La Liga.

But the 24-year-old, who scored 12 goals in Ligue 1 in 2021/22, went on to net 15 times in the Bundesliga and reached 23 in all competitions. He also made the international breakthrough with France, called up for Les Bleusâ 2022 World Cup squad.

Harry Kane tops Real Madrid's list to replace Karim Benzema,"Jun 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/harry-kane-real-madrid-list-to-replace-karim-benzema,"Madrid have long been admirers of Kane, but they were not anticipating needing to replace Benzema until next summer as he had agreed terms to stay in the Spanish capital for another 12-months. However, Benzema's deal has remained unsigned and now he is understood to be close to agreeing a two-year deal to join Saudi Arabia's Pro-League with Al-Ittihad. Now Real's transfer team, led by Juni Calafat, are putting plans in place to replace Benzema and 90min has been told that Kane is their top target having already done plenty of background work on Tottenham's captain. Tottenham's hierarchy have already made it clear that they were not looking to sell Kane this summer, despite the fact he has just one year left on his current deal. feed Kane is also Manchester United's first choice transfer target this summer, but Spurs CEO Daniel Levy is not keen to do business with any other Premier League. That fact could very well open the door to Madrid, however much will depend on Kane's own position on his future and, as yet, he has not pushed to leave the club this summer. Should a move for Kane prove too difficult, as may be the case, they have other options in mind. One of these other options is Napoli's Victor Osimhen - another United target but also one who is very high on Chelsea's summer shopping list.

Joao Cancelo: Potential destinations for Man City star after Bayern loan ends,"May 31, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/joao-cancelo-potential-destinations-man-city-bayern-loan,"Canelo, an utterly unique footballer given his skillset, once appeared to be an indispensable member of City's juggernaut, but a diminished role after the 2022 World Cup saw his relationship with the boss become somewhat strained.  Guardiola's change in tack saw the introduction of four centre-backs across City's defensive line which left little room for Cancelo.  A loan move to Bayern followed in January with both of the clubs Cancelo represented in 2022/23 ending the season as champions. Everyone's a winner! However, with his future at City up in the air and a permanent move to Bayern far from guaranteed, there are doubts over where the Portuguese international will be playing his football next season.  Cancelo, however, does have a number of suitors.  Barcelona's ambition knows no bounds despite their financial misery, and 90min understands that Cancelo, a player they've had their eye on for a while, is on their summer wish list.A January move was impossible due to La Liga's Financial Fair Play regulations but with Jordi Alba now a goner and Jules Kounde looking to play centrally, there's potentially space on either side of Barca's defence.Re-signing Lionel Messi is the club's priority, which would make any kind of permanent deal for Cancelo difficult to achieve, but there's no knowing just how many levers Joan Laporta has left to pull in order to get what he wants. Arsenal are never too far away when a player wants out of Manchester City. The Gunners snapped up Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko last summer, with both playing leading roles in the club's excellent 2022/23 season that for so long looked like would culminate in Premier League glory.The Cityzens, in the absence of Cancelo, however, woke up down the stretch and eventually strolled to their third-straight title. `A busy summer beckons in north London as Arsenal attempt to bridge the gap between themselves and the champions, and sources have confirmed to 90min that Cancelo is of interest. Mikel Arteta only briefly worked with the full-back in Manchester, and there's no doubt the Portuguese international would thrive within his framework.However, will City make the same mistake and allow a player of Cancelo's talent to waltz into the lap of a potential title contender for years to come? That remains to be seen. Bayern have first dibs on Cancelo this summer, owing to the â¬70m optional purchase clause in his loan deal, but it's unlikely that will be triggered.Instead, rather than walk away from him altogether, Bayern may look to do business at around â¬40m to â¬50m - prices that are a little more reflective of Cancelo's standing in the market.With Benjamin Pavard's future uncertain - he's generating interest from Manchester United among others - that may be a smart route for the Bavarians to take. Real Madrid have fallen short of the mark this season, with their Copa del Rey success over Osasuna failing to paper over the cracks of a number of inconsisent performances.One area that undoubtedly needs strengthening is full-back, particularly on the right-hand side. Dani Carvajal remains Real's number one choice but he doesn't really have quality competition for his place - the veteran is also past his best and is not getting any younger.It's 90min's understanding that Real have explored a move for Cancelo, so don't be surprised if Los Blancos come from left field with a cheeky bid. One club always likely to be in the mix for a player like Joao Cancelo is Paris Saint-Germain.The Ligue 1 giants have money oozing out of their paws and often take advantage when others dither in the transfer market, with the sole ambition to strengthen their squad in the hope of winning the Champions League.Cancelo has experience of getting to the final with City and would complement a healthy talent pool that includes Achraf Hakimi and Nuno Mendes."

""My heart's set on that, doing it for the club, my family, for the fans and thatâs my only focus. I want to make them all very happy and my focus is on doing that."" The Hammers are scheduled to face off against Serie A side Fiorentina in the Europa Conference League final on Wednesday 7 June. It will be West Ham's first European final since 1976 when they lost to Anderlecht in the Cup Winners' Cup. The club previously won that competition in 1965."
Diogo Dalot signs new five-year contract with Manchester United,"May 31, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/diogo-dalot-signs-new-five-year-contract-manchester-united,"Dalot has enjoyed a strong season under new United coach Erik ten Hag, and the Dutchman has been keen to get a deal over the line for the Portugal international - who is predominantly a right full-back but also capable of playing on the left side. United have agreed terms after several months of negotiations with the player and his representatives, and Dalot has now signed on the dotted line to take his contract beyond next summer.

When does the 2024 January transfer window open?,"May 31, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/when-does-2024-january-transfer-window-open,"The saying goes that clubs who do their work properly in the summer transfer window do not need to use the January transfer window. That being said, no one can account for big injuries to key players and even the best-run clubs can find themselves needing to make a quick dip into the January transfer market.  Here is what we know so far about the January 2024 transfer window. There can occasionally be calendar confusion around the start of the January transfer window but as 2024 arrives, so will the January transfer window on January 1.  Clubs will then have exactly one month, with the window closing on February 1, to try to protect their prized assets from vultures or make sure they have enough quality and depth in the squad to achieve their objectives for the season. The January transfer window looms large over teams who underachieve at the start of the season. They will be wondering whether sacking their coach and getting someone in ahead of the window to provide transfer input is the best move, or whether they should give the incumbent coach more time.

That being said, some very expensive transfers have taken place in the Premier League during January windows if the right player comes up at that time. Huge names such as Juan Mata, Fernando Torres, Virgil van Dijk and Aymeric Laporte have moved either to or within the Premier League in recent January transfer windows. The most expensive January signing by a Premier League club was actually made in 2023, when Enzo Fernandez signed for Chelsea from Benfica for an incredible Â£106.8m. In that same transfer window, Mykhailo Mudryk also signed for the Blues from Shakhtar Donetsk for Â£62m. Those moves show spending loads of money in January does not always bring an immediate change in results. Below is a table of the most expensive signings by Premier League clubs in the January transfer window. Ranking Player Club left Club joined Year Transfer fee 1 Enzo Fernandez Benfica Chelsea 2023 Â£106.8m 2 Virgil van Dijk Southampton Liverpool 2018 Â£75m 3 Mykhailo Mudryk Shakhtar Donetsk Chelsea 2023 Â£62m 4 Christian Pulisic Borussia Dortmund Chelsea 2019 Â£57.56m 5 Aymeric Laporte Athletic Club Man City 2018 Â£57.2m 6 Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang Borussia Dortmund Arsenal 2018 Â£56m 7 Bruno Fernandes Sporting CP Man United 2020 Â£55m 8 Fernando Torres Liverpool Chelsea 2011 Â£50m 9 Luis Diaz Porto Liverpool 2022 Â£49.9m 10 Anthony Gordon Everton  Newcastle 2023 Â£40m Chelsea have often been the most prolific January shoppers with four of the top ten deals being conducted by them.  The hit rate is not good, either, with Fernando Torres struggling at Chelsea, Christian Pulisic failing to make much of a mark, and Mudryk and Fernandez toiling to begin with. Bruno Fernandes and Virgil van Dijk's signings appear to be the most successful out of the ten on the list above, with both having a clear impact on the team for fees that have aged well."

Champions League finalists Manchester City and Inter hold interest of their own, while Real Madrid and Barcelona are ready to hold talks once the Spanish league season concludes. Liverpool have been in talks with Bayern over potentially bringing Ryan Gravenberch to Anfield, and also hold interest in 27-year-old Pavard. 90min first revealed interest in Pavard's situation from a number of Europe's biggest teams in April. feed The aforementioned clubs have been alerted to a transfer which represents good value for money, with Bayern's price to sell Pavard sitting at around â¬30m. They are willing to cash in given the player has indicated his desire to leave, while they are also looking to raise funds to reinvest in the squad - Bayern are looking to sign a new first choice striker and are interested in West Ham's Declan Rice. United, meanwhile, are in the market to sign cover at centre-back and right-back at a suitable price. 90min has reported previously of their interest in Napoli's Kim Min-jae and Ajax's Jurrien Timber, though Pavard would likely be a cheaper alternative to the two. The former Lille and Stuttgart defender has wanted to leave Bayern for a number of months, and even before the arrival of Thomas Tuchel as Julian Nagelsmann's replacement. His desire is to move to another European ""giant"" and feels that now is the right time. Pavard's camp are actively assessing his options and there are many to consider. The player indicated late last year of his interest in moving to Italy to link up with Olivier Giroud at Milan.

Tottenham are also braced for Chelsea to enter the sweepstakes following the appointment of Mauricio Pochettino as head coach. feed However, sources have now told 90min that the belief across Europe is that Kane will not leave Spurs this summer. Though the striker has only one year left to run on his contract, the belief is Tottenham would demand over Â£100m for him. However, chairman Daniel Levy is not putting a price tag on Kane as he is not currently willing to sanction an exit. Should Kane stay at Tottenham for another year, he would be able to leave on a free transfer in the summer of 2024 if he does not agree terms on a new deal.

Xavi reveals deciding factor in Lionel Messi's Barcelona return,"May 31, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/xavi-deciding-factor-lionel-messi-barcelona-return,"Messi was forced to leave Barca in 2021 after nearly two decades on their books as the club were not able to register his contract with La Liga due to strict financial restrictions. The Argentine forward headed to PSG on a free transfer, but his spell at Parc des Princes has not gone according to plan. PSG have won back-to-back Ligue 1 titles but have continued to underperform in the Champions League, and Messi is set to walk away after just two years in the French capital. 90min understands that Barcelona are confident of finalising a deal in line with La Liga to bring Messi back to Catalonia, though they do face significant competition from Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal, who are ready to make him the highest-paid footballer of all time. Reports in France claim that Al Hilal's offer to Messi could see him earn more than â¬1bn, while there's rumours that Barcelona want Inter Miami to help facilitate a Camp Nou return by signing and loaning him back to La Blaugrana. However, Xavi has insisted that the only thing Barca are waiting on is for Messi to sign a contract, but every other part of the deal is in place. feed ""Our fans started to mention Leo Messiâs name at every gameâ¦I like the feeling. But trust me, the comeback of Leo Messi only depends on him,"" Xavi told Catalan outlet TV3. ""I'd say that it depends 99% on Messi. I have no doubts on football point of view - it's up to Leo."" Xavi recently discussed in a separate interview with Spanish publication SPORT how Messi's return could be accomodated tactically, saying: """"Leo could play in various positions: as a false nine, as a winger, as an inside player, even at the base of midfield coming in to make the final pass. ""Perhaps he has been losing his explosiveness, but we also saw an extraordinary Messi at the World Cup, with explosiveness. In the end I think he still has years ahead of him, at a very high level. Today there is no doubt that he would help us. Messi scored the crucial goal in PSG's 1-1 draw away at Strasbourg on Sunday to hand them a record 11th Ligue 1 title - the strike also saw him become the all-time record scorer in Europe's top five leagues, overtaking Cristiano Ronaldo's total of 495."

Sabitzer's versatility came in handy for Man Utd during the second half of the 2022/23 season and he became a valuable member of the squad. 90min reported in April that Erik ten Hag wanted to keep the 29-year-old having been impressed by him in his brief time at Old Trafford. However, 90min understands that Man Utd and Bayern's valuations of Sabitzer are far apart and a permanent transfer could fall through. feed Man Utd had been hoping to seal a deal for around Â£10m, with 90min previously reporting that the German champions would command a fee similar to the Â£13.7m they paid to RB Leipzig in 2021 for him.

Man Utd remain in the market for a midfielder, with 90min recently reporting of their interest in Mason Mount.

Chelsea hold talks over PSG target Manuel Ugarte,"May 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-talks-psg-target-manuel-ugarte,"A new midfielder has long been on Chelsea's agenda for this summer even before the arrival of new manager Mauricio Pochettino, whose move to Stamford Bridge was finally made official on Monday. Chelsea scouts have drawn up a long list of potential targets and 90min understands that 22-year-old Sporting midfielder Ugarte has emerged as a player of interest, with the Blues reaching out to discuss a possible deal. Paris Saint-Germain are also chasing Ugarte and recently struck an agreement over personal terms with the Uruguay international. The French side are looking to avoid paying his â¬60m release clause up front and are attempting to negotiate a payment plan. It is understood that the Parisians' pursuit of Ugarte is slightly more advanced at this stage, but Chelsea remain in talks over a deal which, if completed, would be the first of the Pochettino era. manual Sporting manager Ruben Amorim recently confessed his club face an uphill battle to keep hold of Ugarte after their failure to qualify for next season's Champions League. ""Obviously itâs difficult to keep players like him, there are several clubs interested, not just one, knowing that our project is not sold and that we missed the Champions League,"" Amorim said. ""It makes everything more difficult."" Chelsea's midfield transfer plans will depend on how many players are sold this summer. Talks are ongoing with N'Golo Kante, who is evaluating his options, while Mateo Kovacic will enter the final 12 months of his contract and could be sold amid interest from a number of Premier League rivals. Alongside Ugarte on Chelsea's radar are West Ham United's Declan Rice and Brighton's Moises Caicedo but, with England's elite all keen on the expensive duo, the Blues are keen to take closer looks at a number of targets. Southampton's Romeo Lavia and Borussia Monchengladbach's Manu Kone are both admired at Stamford Bridge but much will depend on just how much space Chelsea can free up through sales."
The strikers Mauricio Pochettino should sign for Chelsea,"May 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/the-strikers-mauricio-pochettino-should-sign-for-chelsea,"The Blues have been 'bolstering' in attack for the last five years and yet still boast some of the worst goalscoring numbers in the Premier League. With Pochettino now installed in the dugout, it's the Argentine's turn to try and figure out a solution. Here are some strikers he could turn to. manual As one of Europe's top marksmen this season, Napoli hotshot Victor Osimhen is an obvious candidate here.Citing Didier Drogba as his idol, 24-year-old Osimhen has been outrageous this year, leading Serie A's scoring charts and helping turn the Partenopei into one of the continent's leading sides.The main issue here is Osimhen's price tag. Napoli agreed to pay up to â¬80m when they signed him from Lille in 2020 and the belief is he could cost twice as much as that this time around. Yikes. If you want a striker with Premier League experience, Ivan Toney appears the most feasible option. Well, that was until his eight-month ban for gambling offences.With his season now over, Toney ends the campaign with 20 league goals for Brentford. The last time Chelsea had a player reach that number? Diego Costa, six years ago.The ban obviously complicates things. Toney is not permitted to return to action until late January, 2024. That sounds like a discount. The cream of the crop when it comes to attainable Premier League strikers, Tottenham's Harry Kane may jump at the chance to reunite with the man who set him off on the journey to superstardom.Pochettino knows how Kane works and the pair's relationship remains strong. With his situation at Spurs growing more and more uncomfortable, the chance to jump ship may be too strong.Would Spurs ever sell to Chelsea? There's your real dilemma. If Chelsea fans are being honest, Lautaro Martinez wasn't really on the general wish list before fellow Argentine Pochettino took charge.Regardless of how we've found ourselves here, the reality is that Martinez is having a sensational campaign - perhaps the best of his career - and is somehow still flying under the radar.The Inter man isn't the physical, bruising forward that most fans are looking for, but if you want somebody who can put the ball in the back of the net, maybe he's your guy. Why sign a new Â£97.5m striker when you've already got a Â£97.5m striker at home?Nothing else needs to be said about the collapse in relationship between Chelsea fans and Romelu Lukaku, but now we're in a new era, it could be time to leave the past in the past, drop the Italian microphones and get back to playing football.If you can get Lukaku ticking, he's one of a select few strikers who can genuinely claim to be among the world's elite. If Pochettino is up for the battle, this is by far the easiest solution."
Newcastle confident over new Bruno Guimaraes contract despite Barcelona interest,"May 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/newcastle-confident-over-new-bruno-guimaraes-contract-despite-barcelona-interest,"Guimaraes has helped transform Newcastle into a genuine force since his arrival in January 2022, establishing himself as one of the influential midfielders in the Premier League as the Magpies sealed fourth place this season under Eddie Howe. His form has attracted interest from a number of sides across Europe, with Barcelona and Real Madrid both known to be keeping an eye on his situation, but sources have confirmed to 90min that Newcastle have no concerns about losing Guimaraes this summer. 90min understands that Guimaraes is very happy at St James' Park and has been in talks over a huge new contract for months, and Newcastle are confident they will have wrapped up an extension for the midfielder before the new season begins. feed While Barcelona are known to be fans of Guimaraes, he is not believed to be among their top priorities heading into a summer in which the La Liga champions are not expected to have the sort of money needed to complete such a deal. Instead, impending free agent Ilkay Gundogan of Manchester City remains a key target, while Real Sociedad's Martin Zubimendi has also been identified as a preferred replacement for the departing Sergio Busquets at the base of midfield - a position manager Xavi has publicly highlighted as his main concern. Bernardo Silva, Gundogan's City teammate, is also high on Xavi's wish list, while a large portion of the club's spare finances has currently been set aside for their push to re-sign Lionel Messi from Paris Saint-Germain. Barcelona will not make any major decisions on their transfer strategy until La Liga approve their budget for the summer, with Messi expected to be a top priority, while Barcelona also need to find the salary to register Gavi and Ronald Araujo's new contracts."
Mason Mount sends message to Chelsea fans ahead of uncertain summer,"May 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/mason-mount-sends-message-to-chelsea-fans-ahead-of-uncertain-summer,"Having missed the end of Chelsea's season with a pelvic injury, there is a real possibility that Mount may have played his last game for the Blues as he approaches a summer transfer window in which he could be sold. Mount will enter the final year of his contract and has been warned he will be sold this summer if he does not agree an extension. All offers thus far have failed to tempt the midfielder but talks have not yet been ended, with incoming manager Mauricio Pochettino known to be keen to keep hold of Mount. After Sunday's 1-1 draw to close out the season at Stamford Bridge, Mount took part in the lap of appreciation for fans, with Ben Chilwell putting his arm around his close friend as they approached the tunnel. Mount later took to Instagram to send a message to Chelsea fans after what has undoubtedly been a challenging campaign. feed âItâs fair to say itâs been an up and down season but your support has never dipped,"" he began. ""Travelling around the country, you were with us every step of the way and at times we didnât deserve you. But now itâs time to have a break and recover... Thank you and enjoy your summer bluesâ Chelsea have not yet given up hope of keeping Mount, with Pochettino pushing to keep the England international, but club officials are prepared to cash in on one of their most valuable assets before he enters the final 12 months of his contract. Premier League rivals like Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United are all known to be keen to take advantage of the situation and are readying bids for the 24-year-old if he does hit the market."
Dejan Kulusevski unsure about Tottenham future after loan expires,"May 29, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/dejan-kulusevski-unsure-tottenham-future-loan-expires,"The wide forward has been on loan at Tottenham since January 2022 on an initial 18-month loan. Tottenham would have had an obligation to sign the player on a permanent deal for a reported Â£30m, but their failure to qualify for the UEFA Champions League - having finishing eighth in the Premier League - means that said obligation was not triggered.  Due to this, rumours have begun to swirl regarding the Swede's future with the Lilywhites after it previously seemed like a forgone conclusion that he'd sign a long-term deal in north London.  Speaking after his final game, a 4-1 win over relegated Leeds United before his scheduled return to parent club Juventus, Kulusevski admitted he was unsure where his future lies. feed âI don't know, honestly, we will see,"" Kulusevski confessed. ""I am just focused on the pitch, I tried to do as good as I can and now of course it's time to speak with the club.â The 23-year-old has generally impressed at Tottenham when fit, bagging seven assists during his full season at the club. At the tail end of the 2021/22 campaign Kulusevski was arguably the club's best player (along with Harry Kane obviously), scoring five and bagging eight assists in 18 games as Tottenham rallied to secure Champions League football.  Injuries have largely hindered his progress however, with a thigh injury seeing him miss 10 games this season.  Kulusevski ends his loan with Tottenham having made 57 appearances in all competitions, scoring seven goals and adding 16 assists."

Roberto De Zerbi confirms Alexis Mac Allister and Moises Caicedo transfer decision,"May 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/roberto-de-zerbi-confirms-alexis-mac-allister-and-moises-caicedo-transfer-decision,"The pair both featured in Brighton's 2-1 defeat at the hands of Aston Villa on the final day of the season, with Mac Allister playing the full 90 minutes while Caicedo was a half-time substitute. Despite the defeat, Brighton have secured UEFA Europa League football for the 2023/24 season, finishing in sixth place at the end of what's been a stunning campaign for the club.  Unfortunately for the Seagulls fans however, they will have to play in the Europa League without their two star midfielders after De Zerbi confirmed both were set to leave the club: âYes, I think it can be the last game for Alexis and Moises Caicedo. I am really sorry because they are two great people and two great players but the policy of Brighton is like this. âIt is right that they can leave, they can play at a higher level.

A deal to sign the midfielder may cost as much as Â£70m.  Caicedo, on the other hand, is of interest to Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City. 90min recently reported that Brighton were willing to listen to offers for the player this summer.

The best players available to sign from relegated Premier League sides,"May 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/the-best-players-available-to-sign-relegated-premier-league-sides-,"That scenario is likely to play out this summer in particular, with some exceptionally talented squads underperforming and a whole host of talented players dropping down out of the top flight as a result. Everton live to fight another day but, arguably, the real gems for now and in the future can be found at Leicester, Leeds and Southampton - all of whom have surrendered their spot among the elite. Here's the ten best players likely to be on the move this summer. How on earth have Leicester City been relegated? That's the question many people are asking. Not only are the Foxes down just seven years after stunning the world to win the Premier League title, they are going to lose a number of really, really good players. One of the first out of the door will surely be James Maddison, who has been linked with Manchester United, Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal in the past. His most likely landing spot? Quite possibly Newcastle, who are entering the Champions League and could really do with a player of his creative quality. Romeo Lavia has been one of the rare bright spots of a terrible Southampton season. Aged just 19, he has shown incredible composure in central midfield, competing at an exceptionally high level despite things collapsing around him. Chelsea and Liverpool are two of the more logical landing spots and he may be seen by Arsenal as a cheaper alternative to West Ham's Declan Rice. Manchester United and Manchester City have also been linked, though the latter's Â£40m buy-back clause doesn't kick in until 2024. Robin Koch has not enjoyed himself at Leeds United this season, but anybody with a pair of eyes will know his level has been dragged down by those around him. A move away from Elland Road feels like an inevitably, with Newcastle heavily linked as they need more depth in central defence. A versatile operator who is just 26, Koch will also have his pick of clubs back home in the Bundesliga, should any of the top brass feel he's attainable for under Â£20m. It has been a very unusual season for Wilfried Gnonto. For a patch of time, he was the darling of both Leeds United and the Italian national team, but the departure of Jesse Marsch as coach saw his playing time reduce drastically under Javi Gracia. Having paid just â¬4.5m for the former Inter youngster, Leeds could make a serious profit on a player who showed in a very short space of time what he's capable of. A Premier League stay would be nice but the queue of clubs wanting to take Gnonto back to Serie A is growing. If there's one player who has given their all for the cause, it's Southampton captain James Ward-Prowse. The 28-year-old has been the heartbeat of the Saints for the best part of a decade and is one of the world's best free-kick takers. He's also a leader who knows the Premier League inside out, making him an exceptionally appetising prospect. Ward-Prowse regularly knocks on the door of England squad's, which tells you all you need to know about the level of club he could join. This is a situation that Leicester will wish they had handled differently. Youri Tielemans is out of contract on June 30, 2023, so is now certain to leave on a free transfer. Not so long ago, the Belgian was being linked with a move away for around Â£60m - money that could have been reinvested effectively by Leicester. As it is, he will leave for nothing, with Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United potential landing spots. Roma also like Tielemans and he's shown a willingness to move to different countries in the past. If there's one player who really doesn't deserve to go down, based on individual performances alone, it's Harvey Barnes. A scorer of 13 Premier League goals, Barnes showed time and again during 2022/23 just how dangerous he can be on the left flank. A quick, direct runner, he has a keen appetite for goal and is a winger who is genuinely good with both feet. Leicester may still be able to demand up to Â£50m for Barnes, but he's not going to be short of suitors. Newcastle, Aston Villa and West Ham are among those to have been linked, but don't rule out a top side coming in. Jack Harrison is still only 26 years old and has shown during Leeds United's time in the Premier League that he can cut it at that level. Harrison actually travelled to Leicester in January for a medical but the move fell through at the last minute. A new contract was signed at Elland Road, but that may be rendered insignificant if a big-money offer comes in. Wilfred Ndidi was once regarded as one of Europe's best defensive midfielders - it's been some fall from grace during Leicester's season of struggle. But that shouldn't detract from the quality that the Nigerian has. Tireless with his running, Ndidi is strong in the tackle, excels at intercepting balls in the passing lane, and can help transition from defence into attack when things are going well. In a top side, Ndidi's abilities would undoubtedly come to the fore. Kyle Walker-Peters hasn't had a great time of things at Southampton, shipping 73 goals in a side that finished plum last in the table. But that's not a fair reflection on Walker-Peters' ability. Indeed, the 26-year-old has been hugely impressive on the south coast ever since he joined the club in 2020, even breaking into Gareth Southgate's England squad last year. Newcastle could do with a versatile full-back to strengthen their squad, while Walker-Peters would also be a good fit at the likes of Brighton, Aston Villa, Brentford and even former club Tottenham."
Marco Asensio: Potential destinations for Real Madrid forward this summer,"May 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/marco-asensio-potential-destinations-real-madrid-forward,"But life in the Spanish capital hasn't all been plain sailing for Asensio, who has struggled to command a regular place in the side and was also sidelined for most of the 2019/20 season with an anterior cruciate ligament tear. The 27-year-old has been a bit-part player under Carlo Ancelotti during 2022/23, despite notching 12 goals in all competitions, and speculation is rife that Asensio could be moving on when his contract expires this summer. Here's 90min's list of potential destinations for Asensio should he decide it's time to call it quits at Real. feed One of Asensio's most likely destinations is Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain, who are primed for a makeover up front as they prepare for life after Lionel Messi. Messi aside, PSG still boast two of the biggest names in world football - Kylian Mbappe and Neymar - and remain laser focused on conquering Europe and winning a maiden Champions League crown. Asensio has experience of doing that, which is something that PSG may consider while they weigh up whether to offer the Spaniard a contract or not. Asensio has never played a starring role at Real, but he's a supremely gifted footballer that has scored some crucial goals when the pressure is really on. Whether he fits into their current Christophe Galtier-led system is another matter, but the coach may not even be in the Parc des Princes dugout come next season. One of the Premier League's surprise packages this term, Aston Villa are eyeing ambitious summer transfer targets as they look to provide Unai Emery with the ammunition he needs to push on. Villa have previous of signing big name players, namely Philippe Coutinho - though the less said about his permanent switch to the Midlands, the better. Nevertheless, with Emery in charge, Villa have the ability to attract a calibre of player that was previously unattainable, and Asensio may be lured by the opportunity of playing in the Premier League under the Spaniard. Arsenal's desire to strengthen their squad is clear; you only need to listen to the words of manager Mikel Arteta and sporting director Edu to understand that. 90min understands that signing a new right winger to complement Bukayo Saka is high on the club's priority list, and they have been sounded out about taking Asensio to the Emirates Stadium. There is interest, given the possibility of signing a top class international for free, but there's no guarantee the switch would provide Asensio with the minutes he craves. Nonetheless, his arrival could release Saka to play in-field alongside Martin Odegaard, allowing Arteta the option to evolve his side and flex his formations depending on the calibre of opponent being faced. There's also the chance for Asensio to work under one of the Premier League's brightest young coaches. Luis Figo, Ronaldo and Michael Laudrup all have one extremely rare thing in common. Playing for Real Madrid and fierce rivals Barcelona. The Catalan giants have plenty of irons in the fire this summer, namely looking to lure Lionel Messi back to the club from Paris Saint-Germain. But the idea of Asensio drifting across to Camp Nou is one that was floated towards the back end of 2022, with the Spaniard doing little to dampen the speculation. Indeed, Asensio actually stoked the fire and discussed the possibility of joining Barcelona in the summer, only to retract his comments and claim that he'd been 'misinterpreted'. He couldn't, could he? Manchester United are another Premier League side whose ears have pricked up at the news of Asensio being available on a free, and it's easy to see why Erik ten Hag may be tempted. Antony is coming towards the end of a relatively slow first season in Manchester, as he looks to juggle the pressure that comes with being a near Â£100m signing. The Brazilian has shown glimpses of what he's capable of and there's high hopes that his best form is still to come. Still, the one burden on Antony's shoulders this season has been Ten Hag's inability to rotate. He lacks the depth in his squad to rest the 23-year-old and that's where Asensio could, in theory, come into the fold. Left-footed, technically gifted and with a sharp turn of pace, he's exactly the profile of inside forward that the Dutchman tends to like. Asensio isn't likely to come cheap though, with his hefty wages more than making up for the lack of a transfer fee. Still, he could follow in the footsteps of Raphael Varane and Casemiro by switching sunny Spain for a mild Manchester. Hoping their 2021/22 Serie A title will lure Asensio to Italy's capital, AC Milan would welcome the Mallorcan winger with open arms. It was clear when watching both legs of Milan's Champions League semi-final against rivals Inter that there was a lack of firepower up top, and with Junior Messias the wrong side of 30, there may need to be a refreshing of Stefano Pioli's options. Milan have tried to sign Asensio before without success, but the renewal of Rafael Leao's contract should boost their hopes of luring big name signings to San Siro - it's plausible at the very least."
James Milner explains why he is leaving Liverpool,"May 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/james-milner-explains-why-leaving-liverpool,"The 37-year-old is leaving the Reds after eight hugely successful seasons at Anfield, which have yielded Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup and Carabao Cup wins, and a Europa League runners-up medal. 90min reported at the beginning of May that Europa League-bound Brighton are pushing to complete a deal for Milner, with some experience at the highest level of continental competition designed to help Roberto De Zerbi's side take the next step in their exciting rise. But Milner's exit from Merseyside is not something Klopp was aligned with. The German is also saying goodbye to Roberto Firmino, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Naby Keita at the end of their contracts, leaving Liverpool exceptionally light in midfield. Alexis Mac Allister is expected to be a quick incoming, arriving in a big-money move, but Milner has confirmed recent reports that Klopp wanted to reward him with a new contract. ""It's all good because the manager wanted to keep me - which as a player is what you want,"" Milner said of why he is leaving. ""Obviously the club decided a different way. In my head it felt like it could be a good time, so I'm content with how it's all come about. ""It was probably about three weeks ago that I heard from the club. Because I hadn't heard anything, in my own mind I had probably decided myself that I would be going. feed âI will continue to play football, so yes I could be back in front of the Kop potentially. It's an option."" While Milner intends to continue playing, he did go on to speak about his post-retirement plans. The former Manchester City, Aston Villa and Leeds star revealed that he's at odds with himself sometimes about what to do next, though he recognises that not sharing his years of experience with others would be somewhat of a waste. ""Some days I think I'd love a go at management - and then other days you see a manager sign a new contract and six weeks later they get sacked. That's when you think 'maybe the golf course is a better option! ""We'll see. Doing my badges has helped me learn and I've played under some unbelievable managers. Iâve played under some poor ones as well! But you can still learn from them. ""Playing for as long as I have - and with the players that Iâve played alongside - it does seem a shame not to use that knowledge."" Milner's farewell appearance for Liverpool will come on the final day of the Premier League campaign, when the Reds - who will finish fifth and enter the Europa League next year - travel to already relegated Southampton."
Carlo Ancelotti responds to Real Madrid Marco Asensio exit rumours,"May 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/carlo-ancelotti-responds-real-madrid-marco-asensio-exit-rumours,"The 27-year-old's contract at the Santiago Bernabeu expires at the end of June and he is yet to put pen to paper on a new deal. Intermediaries and representatives of Asensio have been sounding out Europe's biggest clubs for a number of months over a potential move, and recent speculation has suggested that Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain are in advanced talks. Asensio played no part in Real Madrid's 2-1 win over Sevilla on Saturday night, earned by a brace from Brazilian forward Rodrygo, but Ancelotti was asked after the game about his position on Asensio and whether or not there was an update on his next steps. ""I donât know anything about Asensio, just like I donât know about others like Nacho. Itâll all be clarified in the coming weeks,"" the Italian confirmed. ""I would be sad if they left because they have been and are important players for us. Whatever they decide, weâll plan accordingly."" feed Real Madrid have put forward a new contract offer to Asensio but even though his preference has been to remain in the Spanish capital, there have been ongoing concerns about his lack of minutes. Indeed, just 13 of Asensio's 30 La Liga appearances have come as a starter, while he featured even less in the club's run to the Champions League semi-finals. He has still managed to contribute nine goals in La Liga and 12 in all competitions - matching his career-best tally from the 2021/22 season.  Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City are among a string of Premier League clubs to have shown interest in Asensio's situation, in addition to Bayern Munich, Juventus and Marseille from the continent. Asensio's final appearance for Real Madrid - if he does decide to leave for pastures new - could come against Athletic Club when the La Liga season concludes on 4 June."
Xavi reveals how Barcelona must replace Sergio Busquets,"May 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/xavi-how-barcelona-must-replace-sergio-busquets,"The 34-year-old is leaving Camp Nou 15 years after breaking into the first team as a teenager, having won 32 major honours with the club. Busquets' trophy haul includes nine La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey triumphs and three Champions League crowns. Busquets has played over 700 games in all competitions for Barca and has been a staple of the side under Pep Guardiola, Tito Vilanova, Luis Enrique, Ernesto Valverde, Xavi and other managers. His departure will leave a huge void for Barca, who despite their abundance of quality midfielders, lack a player capable of filling Busquets' boots in the anchor role. Bayern Munich's Joshua Kimmich has been linked with a move to Camp Nou, while there's active interest in Real Sociedad midfielder Martin Zubimendi. Whatever Barca do, Xavi has admitted that the club must get their decision right if they are to continue competing for the major honours that they have won this season. ""Whoever is more complete, whoever is the best pivot to replace Busquets,"" Xavi replied when asked how he'll replace the Spaniard. ""We depend on âfair playâ and the economic situation. The profile must be a very determined player, who wins duels and is intelligent. The natural substitute for Busi. feed ""You have to find that piece. If we want to compete well next year, itâs essential. Busi has been fundamental to getting the Super Cup and La Liga. We have to find a very important player to replace Busquets.â Barca's precarious financial situation means a number of players will need to leave in order to facilitate incomings. Raphinha, Ferran Torres and Ansu Fati are among those who Barca could look to move on Camp Nou, while there's uncertainty over the future of Jules Kounde despite his denial of being unhappy at playing out of position. President Joan Laporta is moving heaven and earth to complete a fairytale return to Barcelona for Lionel Messi, while the club are actively engaging in talks with Manchester City captain Ilkay Gundogan. The 32-year-old German is available on a free transfer but isn't the same profile of player as Busquets - meaning another midfielder may still need to be targeted. Barca are also wanting to strengthen their squad with another striker and continue to show interest in another Manchester City player, Bernardo Silva."

Real Madrid close to Jude Bellingham agreement with Borussia Dortmund,"May 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/real-madrid-close-jude-bellingham-agreement-borussia-dortmund,"Most of Europe's elite have been chasing Bellingham over the past 12 months but Real moved clear in the race for his signature when they struck an agreement over personal terms with the 19-year-old last month. Bellingham, whose preference is to join Real this summer, has agreed the terms of a six-year contract in Madrid that will include a â¬1bn release clause. All that was left was an agreement between the two sides over a transfer fee. Dortmund have long made it clear that they are looking for around â¬150m to part ways with Bellingham and sources have now confirmed to 90min that Real have indicated a willingness to meet that figure. Meetings in Germany this week have seen Real and Dortmund agree the structure of a deal worth an initial â¬100m, with a further â¬50m in add-ons, to push the transfer closer to completion. feed 90min understands Real attempted to lower Dortmund's asking price by including a number of players, either on permanent or loan deals, but the German side insisted they wanted a cash-only offer. That being said, Dortmund have not yet ruled out the idea of returning to Real for potential signings of their own this summer, although any moves will be separate from Bellingham's proposed switch to the Santiago Bernabeu. An official announcement has been delayed by Real out of respect for Dortmund's Bundesliga title push. Edin Terzic's side sit top heading into Saturday's meeting with Mainz on the final day of the season and must match Bayern Munich's result against Koln if they are to get their hands on the trophy. Once that match is out of the way, Real will push ahead with their plans to finalise Bellingham's arrival and there is hope among the Spanish outfit that a deal can be announced next week. Los Blancos are also looking to recruit a new striker to compete with Karim Benzema, while they are eyeing up two new defenders as well. Carlo Ancelotti recently confirmed that Rayo Vallecano left-back Fran Garcia will join the club this summer but the Spanish side also hope to add an expensive new signing like RB Leipzig's Josko Gvardiol or Bayern Munich's Alphonso Davies - deals which both appear unlikely given the cost."
Jurgen Klopp sends firm transfer message to Liverpool stars over lack of Champions League football,"May 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jurgen-klopp-sends-firm-transfer-message-liverpool-stars-lack-champions-league-football,"Despite an outstanding recent run of form, Liverpool failed to climb their way back into the top four and will instead have to settle for the Europa League qualification that comes with finishing fifth. Star forward Mohamed Salah admitted he was 'totally devastated' to miss out on Europe's premier competition - issuing a social media apology which, bizarrely, has been interpreted by some as a desire to leave Anfield. Asked about Salah's feelings, Klopp laughed off the suggestions that the Egyptian might want to leave Liverpool this summer but made it clear that anybody frustrated by the lack of Champions League football will be happily allowed to leave. ""Mo loves being here,"" he said. ""He was part of the apologies for what we did, not apologies for what the other guys did. No, it is all fine. feed ""If ever a player comes to me and says: 'We didnât qualify for the Champions League, now I have to leave' then I would drive him to the other club. Iâd take the key and ask: 'Where do you want to go? I will drive you'. That would be something I would never understand. ""I would never say: 'I need to work in the Champions League so now I go'. I am responsible for this 'mess' or whatever. You cannot go in these moments. ""Nobody has asked me [about leaving]. They asked me if they could have a day longer holiday or whatever, but nobody asked me if after their holiday they have to come back. Thatâs not been in our conversations."" Klopp went on to insist that Liverpool's failure to reach the Champions League will not impact their transfer plans this summer. ""I don't think so but we will see,"" he explained. ""That is obviously possible, it's always possible things don't go as quick as you want. It's not only possible, it is probably likely.  ""The better the players you want the lesser is the desire of the other club to let him go and that's exactly what we are prepared for. But it's a long window and a long pre-season and a long break in-between so we have time. If we get in players tomorrow or in six or seven weeks it is not a game-changer for me to be honest. In an ideal world they all sign tomorrow and I can tell them when to be here and we can start giving them the plans for the summer break but that will not likely happen."""

Jules Kounde speaks out on transfer speculation,"May 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jules-kounde-speaks-out-on-transfer-speculation,"90min revealed earlier this week that BarÃ§a had been shocked by reports that the Frenchman was seeking an exit due to being played out of position for much of this season, and that they were not impressed with his conduct. However, Kounde has now refuted claims that he asked Barcelona to let him seek a new challenge only a year after signing from Sevilla. ""To make it clear, at no time did I ask to leave, and I'm not going anywhere,"" the defender said on Twitter. This statement dispels further speculation that arose when Barcelona's director of football, Mateu Alemany, failed to quell rumours of a potential exit after Tuesday's 3-1 defeat to Real Valladolid. feed Alemany at the time said: ""These are internal situations that we will resolve internally."" Head coach Xavi has since confirmed that he had discussed the matter with Kounde and asserted that they were on the same page. ""I spoke to him, yes, we were happy, and everything was clear.""I don't see any problems. We both came out of the meeting happy,"" Xavi insisted. Kounde has played a vital role in Xavi's team this season, helping them regain La Liga from Real Madrid. The club will look to strengthen this summer to compete on all fronts this season, but their financial challenges and the need to comply with La Liga's feasibility plans may necessitate the sale of key players to secure top transfer targets. Barcelona have shown interest in Bayern Munich's Benjamin Pavard - another versatile French defender capable of playing at right-back and centre-back - and 90min understands they had considered offering them Kounde as part of a potential package. Chelsea, once managed by Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel, had previously Kounde for two years before his move to Barcelona last summer. Newcastle are also admirers of the defender."
Eddie Howe confirms Newcastle's desire for 'marquee signings' as PIF make transfer plans,"May 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/eddie-howe-confirms-newcastle-desire-marquee-signings-pif-transfer-plans,"Howe has guided Newcastle into the Champions League in his first full season in charge, and despite a quarter of a billion pounds being spent since his arrival at the club in late 2021, he has long insisted they still need to be careful with how they use their money. 90min revealed earlier this month that the club's majority shareholders, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), were eager to spend lavishly. They are set to provide substantial funds and have their eyes on some major deals. Newcastle are due to announce some major sponsorships this summer which, coupled with European qualification, will enable them to rub shoulders in the transfer market with almost anyone in world football. Neymar is one of the players PIF have identified as a possible signing, as 90min recently reported, and not just because of his standing in the game but because Newcastle are in need of a left-sided attacker. Howe has now admitted that he would sanction signings in the ilk of Neymar and other superstars. Ahead of Newcastle's final game with Chelsea on Sunday, Howe was asked if his summer wish-list would include 'marquee' transfers. ""Yes,Â there would be players we'd love to bring in that would be classified in thatÂ bracket, I'm sure,"" he replied. ""For me, it's more about the role they can fulfil in the team - whether that'sÂ viewed positively or as a marquee signing, then great. ""I'm not in my mind thinking, 'We have to have one of those players that ticksÂ that box for the supporters'. As much as I'd love to do that, it's about findingÂ the right player in the right position who I think makes us better."" feed Howe added: ""Unfortunately players don't come cheap, especially good players. Yes, we are going to have to spend a certain amount of money. How much that is, I don't know. ""I still don't know what my budget is at this moment in time, but there will have to be some expenditure. It will have to be controlled. It will have to be under FFP restrictions, which we have worked under and will continue to work under. They are definitely impacting us and what we will be able to do."" Howe also insisted that despite enhancing his squad, he won't be jettisoning his current stars who have taken them into the top-four. ""Dan [Ashworth, director of football] has made the point to me about trading being an important part of our future. That does not necessarily mean selling your best players, but trading with FFP rules can be a good thing for your finances,"" he continued. ""The club will also be very keen to protect their assets and be ahead of the curve in terms of contract length and make sure weâre in a strong position, but also recognising players who have done well and rewarding them for their performances."" 90min understands that Newcastle are looking at bringing in up to six new players across various positions. A holding midfielder, right-sided centre-half, a left-back and two forwards are among the roles they are hoping to strengthen in. James Maddison and Scott McTominay are just two names that are very high on Newcastle's summer shortlist."
Man City express interest in Joshua Kimmich,"May 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-city-express-interest-in-joshua-kimmich,"90min reported last week that the midfielder was considering his future at the Allianz Arena and a number of elite European sides had been made aware that he may be looking for a new challenge. Kimmich's situation has now notably drawn the attention of Man City, who are in the market for a midfielder - prime target Jude Bellingham is set to join Real Madrid instead, while Bernardo Silva out-of-contract Ilkay Gundogan could leave the club this summer. 90min understands that Man City believe Kimmich, who has previously worked under Pep Guardiola, would be capable of slotting seamlessly into their midfield and they have outlined a deal which could see Cancelo join Bayern on a permanent transfer. The versatile full-back surprisingly left the Etihad Stadium for the Bundesliga at the back-end of the January transfer window, but struggled to initially make an impact under Julian Nagelsmann. However, since Thomas Tuchel became the new head coach, Cancelo has had more of a starring role and the 49-year-old wants to keep him in Bavaria. feed Bayern were drawn against Man City in the quarter-finals of this season's Champions League and Cancelo was roundly booed after coming off the bench at the Etihad. While Bayern's stance initially was to not even consider any approach for Kimmich, it remains to be seen whether Man City's strong interest will change their stance in any way. Man City have wrapped up the Premier League title and have their eyes on the treble, with rivals Man Utd to come in the FA Cup final before a showdown with Inter in the Champions League final. Bayern, however, will need to beat Koln and hope Borussia Dortmund are beaten by Mainz to win an 11th-straight Bundesliga after losing control of the title race last week."
Erik ten Hag demands Man Utd summer transfers to close gap to Man City,"May 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/erik-ten-hag-demands-man-utd-summer-transfers-close-gap-man-city,"United's convincing 4-1 victory over Chelsea at Old Trafford on Thursday secured a top-four spot with a game to spare. The Red Devils face Fulham in their final Premier League game on Sunday before facing Manchester City in the FA Cup final. The Dutchman is already eyeing the upcoming transfer window to narrow the gap between United and rivals City. ""This club belongs in the Champions League,"" stated Ten Hag. ""Finishing in the top four was the main objective. The competition is tough. There are many teams with really good squads, good managers and high budgets. ""For this moment it is the maximum but we want more and I don't have a lot of patience. Standards have to go up. Manchester City are playing outstanding football but we have a way to go. ""In the summer we can work with the squad we have but we need to strengthen. ""It's difficult to say at this moment; we need to see how the transfer window unfolds, but it seems clear that we need more. ""We want to win every game, but as I have just explained, it's challenging here. There are really good teams, especially this season. Manchester City is playing exceptionally well. We are moving in the right direction, but we still have work to do. It's a work in progress."" feed Ten Hag agreed that a top-four finish can be considered equivalent to a trophy, but stressed that settling for this is not good enough for him. ""I think in this league, that's a good base to be in the top four but, yeah, we want to compete for the title. But it has to be realistic. You can first say when you have your squad in the end of the transfer window... and you can make a statement about if it's realistic or not,"" Ten Hag explained. ""Now we are far away, so we have a lot of work to do, we've made progress with this team, with this squad but we need better players if we want to compete for the highest."" Ten Hag concluded: ""I think in the Premier League, yeah, [top four] is something like [a trophy], it's the main objective of the season to get in the Champions League, so therefore you have to see yourself in the top four. The competition is tough, there are many teams with really good squads, good managers, so when you are in there, you did a good job and your team is playing well and performing well and for this moment this is the maximum but we want more."""
Fabinho reveals Liverpool's shocked reaction to Roberto Firmino exit,"May 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/fabinho-reveals-liverpool-shocked-reaction-roberto-firmino-exit,"The midfielder - a team-mate of Firmino's for both Liverpool and Brazil - believes that the forward still has his best football ahead of him. Firmino is gearing up for his final match as a Reds player and could be given a chance to start against Southampton on Sunday. The news of Firmino's departure has left Liverpool supporters and those within the club saddened, prompting a farewell party at Anfield last week. Speaking to Sky Sports before Firmino's exit, Fabinho expressed his surprise at the decision, revealing that the team had been encouraging him to stay. ""This season, we were always asking him, 'Bobby, when are you signing your new contract?'"" Fabinho said. ""[We told him], 'Come on, we want you to sign, you have to stay here with us.' We didn't really expect him to go. ""So yes, we didn't really expect this decision to be made, but he has to go."" feed Over the last couple of seasons, Firmino lost his position as a first-choice starter under Jurgen Klopp, withDarwin Nunez and Cody Gakpo taking on the centre-forward role this year. While Firmino is seen as making way for the next generation, Fabinho also noted his frustration with the striker's fitness issues. ""Sometimes we saw that he was not happy because of the injuries as well,"" Fabinho added. ""He's somebody that really didn't get injured, but this season he struggled a little bit with injuries. But now, we already know he will not stay. It was a pretty emotional week for all of us. ""Everybody loves him. Us players, we love him because he's a really nice guy. He doesn't want the [accolades], he doesn't care about it. He just wants to help the team. That's why we love him."" Liverpool will bid farewell to three other players at the end of the season - Naby Keita, James Milner, and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain - who have all played their part in the club's success under Klopp."

Edouard Mendy likely to leave Chelsea ahead of Kepa Arrizabalaga,"May 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/edouard-mendy-leave-chelsea-kepa-arrizabalaga,"31-year-old Mendy, who joined Chelsea in 2020 and played a huge role in the team's Champions League triumph in his debut season, has been benched for the second half of the campaign in favour of Kepa Arrizabalaga. Both goalkeepers will enter the final two years of their contracts this summer and, as a result, Chelsea are open to offers for both Mendy and Kepa. Despite his recent string of starts, 90min understands that Chelsea would prefer to cash in on Kepa, who became the world's most expensive goalkeeper when he moved to Stamford Bridge for Â£71.6m in 2018, but his high wages have long complicated plans to get the Spaniard off the books. That salary is again expected to limit Kepa's options this summer and could push Mendy closer to the exit door, with the Senegal international's pay packet understood to be significantly lower. feed As a result, Mendy is seen as the easier goalkeeper to sell and it is hoped that the Champions League and Club World Cup winner will attract plenty of interest. Linked to these plans is Chelsea's desire to sign a new starting goalkeeper, and the Blues have voiced their interest in a number of potential options from across Europe. Inter's Andre Onana is a target for Chelsea, who would be prepared to offer either Mendy or Kepa to the Serie A side in an attempt to drive down his price tag, while Brighton's Robert Sanchez and Brentford's David Raya are being eyed and boast several years of Premier League experience. Porto's 23-year-old stopper Diogo Costa is also admired. Chelsea also have 19-year-old Gabriel Slonina on the books. The American international, signed from Chicago Fire last year, has impressed with the Under-21 side this season and is in line for a loan move for his first taste of senior football in Europe."
Football transfer rumours: Real Madrid agree Bellingham fee; Kante offered to Barcelona,"May 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/football-transfer-rumours-real-madrid-agree-bellingham-fee-kante-barcelona-26-5-23,manual
Ona Batlle agrees to join Barcelona,"May 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ona-batlle-agrees-to-join-barcelona,"The Spaniard has become a fan favourite at United since joining the club in 2020 and has established herself as one of the best full-backs in the world during that time. Batlle was initially due to be out of contract at the end of last season, with the club choosing to trigger a 12-month extension. Talks over a new long-term deal had been ongoing for some time, but no agreement was reached, paving the way for a return home. The 23-year-old made her name as a player during spells with Madrid CFF and Levante, but she hails from the Catalan town of Vilassar del Mar and joined Barcelonaâs famed La Masia as a 12-year-old, eventually rising to Barcelona B, before starting her senior career elsewhere in 2017. Batlle has had a stunning season for United at both ends of the pitch. The way she completely shut down Lauren Hemp during last weekendâs victorious Manchester derby encapsulates her defensive supremacy, while her nine WSL assists indicate her enormous attacking importance â no other defender even comes close to that number, while only Chelsea winger Guro Reiten (10) has more. feed Batlle will join a Barcelona squad that already has Lucy Bronze. But the England right-back will be 32 in the autumn and only has one more year left on her contract. Batlle also has the versatility to operate as a left-back, which Barcelona have lacked since last summerâs Leila Ouahabi exit. Sweden winger Fridolina Rolfo has spent much of the current season in that role instead. As far as Manchester United are concerned, manager Marc Skinner insisted after the Manchester derby that the future success of the team wonât be dependent on individual players. Discussing both Batlle and Alessia Russo, who is also due to be out of contract next month but could yet stay, he commented: ""If they're here [next season] we'll be great and if they're not here, we'll [still] be great. That's the defiance of me and this club â one player won't make a Manchester United team. That's got to be clear if we want to win things."" United will hope that January signing Jayde Riviere is a readymade replacement at right-back. The Canadian international was recovering from long-term injury when she arrived but made her debut off the bench in the recent win over Tottenham and Skinner has made big claims about her ability. ""We're taking this time to embed her, but she is a dangerous player to play against,"" he said. ""Our fans will have a world class player there â she will work every day to make sure she is that."""
Angel Di Maria set to leave Juventus amid MLS and Saudi Arabia interest,"May 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/angel-di-maria-set-leave-juventus-mls-saudi-arabia-interest,"The Argentine World Cup winner signed a one-year deal at Juve last summer following the expiration of his deal at Paris Saint-Germain. Following a rocky start to life in Serie A, during which he was sent off in a defeat to Monza for violent conduct, Di Maria's form improved dramatically in the first few months of 2023.  Di Maria would prove to be pivotal in Juventus' run to the UEFA Europa League semi-final, scoring a hat trick against Nantes back in February and following that up with a winner against Freiburg the following month.  Since that goal however, Di Maria has gone 14 appearances without a single goal contribution and attracted the frustration of fans for his performances in Juve's semi-final clashes against Sevilla.  feed 90min now understands that contract talks between Di Maria's representatives and Juve over a new one-year extension have broken down, with the forward now set to leave the club.  Sources have confirmed that there is interest from MLS and Saudi Arabian clubs in the player's services as he becomes a free agent for a second consecutive summer.  Both Di Maria and the club itself are in agreement that the best course of action is to part ways at the end of the season. The 35-year-old has previously enjoyed lengthy spells at European giants Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain, winning the UEFA Champions League in 2014 with the former. "
Declan Rice not a priority target for Bayern Munich as Man Utd links resurface,"May 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/declan-rice-not-priority-target-bayern-munich-man-utd-transfer,"The Bavarian giants have been linked with a move for the 24-year-old in recent days, joining the ever-growing list of clubs interested in prising him away from London Stadium. Rice has attracted the attention of Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Newcastle thanks to his consistently outstanding performances for West Ham, and Manchester United remain interested as they consider bolstering Erik ten Hag's midfield options. West Ham know they face an uphill battle to keep Rice, who has two years remaining on his contract, but remain steadfast in their valuation. The Hammers believe Rice is worth at least Â£100m in today's market and sources have reaffirmed to 90min that the club have no intention of compromising on that figure â either it is met or a move will not happen. A fee of that size would comfortably smash Bayern's transfer record - Lucas Hernandez is their record purchase at just shy of Â£70m - and although the club, and head coach Thomas Tuchel, appreciate Rice's ability and believe that he could make a significant impact in both the Bundesliga and Champions League, 90min understands that a deal is not regarded as a priority at this stage. Bayern are instead looking to replace the guaranteed goals supply of Robert Lewandowski, who left last summer to join Barcelona after eight hugely successful seasons in Munich, despite the sudden uncertainty over the future of midfielder Joshua Kimmich. feed Tottenham striker Harry Kane remains Bayern's number one target and, like with Rice, a deal is affordable should the club wish to follow through their interest with a bid. Doing so may compromise their ability to facilitate other transfers, however, unless they are able to generate money through the sale of Sadio Mane - he will be allowed to leave the Allianz Arena if the price is right - and Lucas Hernandez, who has agreed personal terms with PSG. There's no guarantee that Kane or Rice would make the move to Germany. What Rice has done is publicly state his ambition to play in the Champions League and compete for trophies â the latter is something he could now do with West Ham as they prepare to contest the Europa Conference League final with Fiorentina â which has led to months and months of speculation about where he may end up. 90min understands that Arsenal are pushing hard for Rice and are confident that a deal can be agreed with West Ham. However, it's unclear whether or not they would be willing to match the Â£100m asking price, which may open the door for London rivals Chelsea â incoming manager Mauricio Pochettino is a huge fan and considers Rice to be an upgrade on a number of the club's current options. Manchester City are also lingering with intent as they are yet to tie down Ilkay Gundogan to a new contract, while uncertainty remains over the future of Barcelona and PSG target Bernardo Silva."
PSG agree personal terms with Manuel Ugarte & Lucas Hernandez,"May 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-agree-personal-terms-with-manuel-ugarte-lucas-hernandez,"Despite heading for another Ligue 1 title, PSG have endured a disappointing season by their standards. Coupe de France and UEFA Champions League campaigns both ended in abrupt defeats and so PSG officials are keen to improve their squad. Midfield reinforcements are high on PSG's wish list and contact has now been made with Sporting CP over a deal for in-demand Uruguay international Ugarte. Ugarte has plenty of interest from the Premier League but is also open to the idea of moving to the French giants and PSG have already voiced a willingness to meet his wage demands, with talks now on with Sporting over a transfer fee. The 22-year-old has a release clause of around â¬60m which 90min understands PSG are reluctant to pay up front, with talks now on over a deal which would see the French side pay in instalments instead. feed Also on PSG's radar is Bayern defender Lucas, who is approaching the final two years of his contract in Bavaria. An agreement over personal terms has also been reached with the 27-year-old, who is now evaluating all his options. Bayern are keen to keep Lucas but have already made it clear they will not match PSG's offer to the Frenchman. Should Lucas refuse to extend his stay in Germany, Bayern are prepared to sell this summer and PSG are ready to make an offer if the versatile defender hits the market. Bayern paid â¬80m to sign Lucas from Atletico Madrid in the summer of 2019, but injuries have prevented him from showcasing his best form. Lucas suffered a season-ending knee injury just 13 minutes into France's opening fixture of the 2022 FIFA World Cup and may well have played his final game for Bayern as a result."
Carlo Ancelotti confirms Real Madrid's first signing of the summer,"May 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/carlo-ancelotti-confirms-real-madrid-first-signing-summer,"The 23-year-old came through the Real Madrid youth system and made one appearance for the Spanish giants during the 2018/19 season before being shipped out on loan to Rayo in 2020. After helping the club to La Liga promotion, Garcia signed permanently for the club and has impressed in the top flight ever since.  Following a season in which his side Rayo finished a respectable 11th in La Liga, the Spanish defender has now secured a move to his boyhood club Real Madrid.  feed Speaking to the press after Los Blancos' 2-1 victory over Rayo at the Santiago Bernabeu, Ancelotti confirmed the signing, revealing: âFran Garcia is a left-back who has a lot of energy. He is very fast with the ball, and he attacks very well.  ""He is a very good profile for Real Madrid, and next year he will be with us.â Along with Garcia, Madrid are also working extremely hard to finalise a deal to sign Jude Bellingham this summer.  90min reported earlier in May that the dynamic midfielder has agreed personal terms with Real Madrid ahead of a blockbuster move.  Real Madrid secured a last ditch win on Wednesday evening thanks to an 89th minute winner from Rodrygo Goes after Raul de Tomas cancelled out a first-half goal from Karim Benzema. The result sees Ancelotti's side rise up to second in the La Liga table thanks to Atletico Madrid's thrilling 3-3 draw with Espanyol."
Erik ten Hag confident of Man Utd transfer plans despite takeover uncertainty,"May 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/erik-ten-hag-confident-of-man-utd-transfer-plans-despite-takeover-uncertainty,"United's current owners, the Glazer family, have received significant bids from the likes of Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al-Thani and Sir Jim Ratcliffe - 90min understands the latter's offer is favoured - but there remains significant uncertainty over the entire process. Just whether the Glazers will remain at the club as part of any takeover is unclear, while the decision over a sale has dragged on for months and will now overlap with the summer transfer window, sparking fears that Ten Hag may not receive the financial backing he needs to bolster the team. However, the Dutchman is confident he will be able to push ahead with his plans for the squad this summer regardless of what is going on behind the scenes. ""Yeah, that's what I'm doing and that's our job,"" he told Sky Sports News when asked if he has been able to plan adequately for the summer amid all the uncertainty. feed ""This season that has to be our energy and the focus, but of course we are also planning for the future, for next season and that's what we have to do. And that is also talking with your scouting department, recruitment responsibilities, and talking with players of course."" Asked whether he was confident United could move for their top targets even if the Glazers remain at the club, Ten Hag added: ""I think so. I came in here [at the end of] last season and we talked about what can we do in the squad, what can we do in transfers. ""And last year, the club confirmed they can do. So, for me, I don't think anything changed and yeah, in this summer period we can do the same."" A new striker is high on Ten Hag's wish list. Tottenham's Harry Kane remains the top target, while Napoli's Victor Osimhen, Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic and Inter's Lautaro Martinez are all under consideration as well. 90min understands there are plans to sign more than one new forward. Ten Hag also wants a new centre-back and is keen on Napoli's Kim Min-jae, whose bargain release clause of anywhere between â¬40m and â¬60m has piqued the interest of a number of clubs across Europe."

West Ham undertaking thorough search for new director of football,"May 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/west-ham-undertaking-thorough-search-new-director-football,"The Hammers' dealings over the past year have largely been overseen by manager David Moyes and head of recruitment Rob Newman, with over Â£150m spent on new players last summer in a bid to continue building on the sixth and seventh place finishes earned during the 2020/21 and 2021/22 Premier League seasons. West Ham's 2022/23 campaign hasn't gone as planned from a domestic point of view - they sit 14th in the table and had been engrossed in the battle to beat relegation until a recent spate of wins - but progression to the Europa Conference League final has relieved some of the pressure on Moyes and the team overall. 90min understands majority owner David Sullivan has expressed his dissatisfaction over the club's performances this season, and in particular the impact of some of the club's more expensive signings. An appointment to take back an element of control over which players are targeted and signed by the club is being sought as a result. Roma sporting director Tiago Pinto is among the frontrunners for the director of football position - which will see Mark Noble transition into a slightly different role - while 90min understands Tim Steidten, formerly of Bayer Leverkusen, Brentford's Lee Dykes, Benfica's Rui Pedro Braz and Aston Villa's Johan Lange are also under consideration. The off-field uncertainty stretches to Moyes himself, with a decision yet to be made about his long-term future. 90min reported in March the Scot was unlikely to continue at the London Stadium even if the club end up winning the Europa Conference League, but that stance has softened in recent weeks with Premier League safety and a place in Prague now assured. Moyes hopes to at least see out the final year of his contract, 90min further understands, but is acutely aware the West Ham hierarchy do not want a repeat of this season's trials and tribulations. The Hammers have lost 19 Premier League games this season and have found it difficult to score goals â Said Benrahma is their top scorer in the league with just six."
Premier League confirms transfer window dates for 2023/24 season,"May 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/premier-league-confirms-transfer-window-dates-2023-24-season,"Although player contracts do not end until 30 June, which means any free agent signings will become official from 1 July, deals between clubs can be completed two weeks earlier that that. There are also different rules for domestic and international transfers, which may delay the latter until 1 July. The 20 top flight sides in England, which will feature Burnley, Sheffield United and one of Luton or Coventry, with the latter two contesting the Championship playoff final at the end of the month, will then be able to sign players for the next two and a half months. The summer transfer deadline will fall on at 11pm (BST) on 1 September. feed In previous seasons, the Premier League briefly decided to end its summer transfer window earlier than the rest of Europe. That hasn't been the case for the last few years after the short-sightedness of the plan was quickly exposed, and the league has confirmed that the new season's transfer window dates following talks with the EFL and league systems in Spain, Germany, Italy and France. The transfer deadlines in all of Europe's top five leagues will therefore close on the same day. In winter, the transfer window will open for business on 1 January 2024 and run for the whole of the month until it closes on 1 February at 11pm (GMT). Again, the transfer window for Premier League clubs will close on the same day as for La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1."
Erik ten Hag responds to rumours linking Neymar with Man Utd,"May 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/erik-ten-hag-responds-to-rumours-linking-neymar-with-man-utd,"A report from French publication L'Equipe this week claimed that United have opened talks with PSG and that Casemiro has been trying to persuade his international teammate to join him at United. Neymar joined PSG in a world record â¬222m transfer from Barcelona in 2017 when the French giants ambitiously triggered his buyout clause at Camp Nou. His current contract at Parc des Prince, which was signed in 2021, has another two years to run. 90min has previously reported that Manchester United have been among the clubs contacted by intermediaries to make them aware of Neymarâs potential availability. But Ten Hag chose to give a vague and general answer when asked for comment. ""When we have news, we will tell you,"" the Dutchman said. 90min reported just this week that United are being kept informed of Neymar's situation, but hold no active interest in the 31-year-old at this time. United are considering signing two central strikers this summer, which Neymar isn't, with Harry Kane, Victor Osimhen, Lautaro Martinez and Dusan Vlahovic among high profile primary considerations. The second would likely be a younger player to develop - Rasmus Hojlund, Santiago Gimenez and Goncalo Ramos. Benjamin Sesko and Mohammed Kudus have also been recommended by scouts. feed 90min first revealed last summer that the PSG hierarchy has been considering the possibility of letting the player go. Club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi also warned around that time that PSG are looking to change strategy: ""We don't want flashy, bling-bling anymore, it's the end of the glitter."" As such, intermediaries briefed Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea and nouveau riche Newcastle last summer about Neymarâs potential availability. However, PSG were still weighing up whether selling the Brazilian before the World Cup was the right move for them. 90min reported in February of this year that Neymar was again offered to a number of Premier League clubs by intermediaries, making Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Newcastle and Liverpool aware of the player's interest in moving to England and his potential availability. As of the start of May, 90min was able to reveal that Newcastle's majority owners, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, are interested in bringing Neymar to the Premier League. PIF had also shown interest in Cristiano Ronaldo until it was decided that the 38-year-old would not be the right fit for the current team that has been assembled. But Neymar could be, given Newcastle's need for a left-sided forward and a handful of other Brazilians already on Tyneside."
Napoli concerned by Kim Min-jae release clause amid Man Utd links,"May 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/napoli-concerned-by-kim-min-jae-release-clause-amid-man-utd-links,"Sources close to the Italian champions have confirmed to 90min that there is a clause that exists in Kimâs deal that could see him leave in a specific window if a club meets a required fee. Manchester United have held talks over a possible deal, while other Premier League clubs hold interest. A fee to extract Kim from Napoli in early July will range between â¬40m and â¬60m, though the final figure is understood to be fluid and related to the buying club's turnover. Regardless of a final fee, it would still be far below the player's real market value - which has rocketed to around â¬100m. Napoli were essentially forced to include the exit clause in the deal to sign Kim last summer, and it was used as a tool to convince the South Korean to choose to move to Naples ahead of Ligue 1 club Rennes. He joined from Fenerbahce in July for just over â¬18m. feed The club have been trying to finalise a new deal with Kim since before the World Cup finals last year, but his agents have kept Napoli at an armâs length throughout this year. The player re-signing at Napoli can't be ruled out at this stage, but Kim's camp are aware of mounting interest in his services and are exploring their options. 90min can confirm that Manchester United have held talks about a possible deal and they are well positioned to make a move for Kim - who has never hidden his desire to one day play in the Premier League. Sources also confirm that United are not the only club courting Kim, and not the only one in England. Liverpool and Newcastle are both confirmed admirers of Kim, and both are in the market for central defenders this off season, whilst it is believed Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City are also ""aware"" of the situation and could yet become involved. Paris Saint-Germain are also in the mix, even with the summer arrival of Milan Skriniar, while Real Madrid and Barcelona are being kept informed of the situation too. Kim himself is set for military service in June, but come July he will make a decision on where he wants to play next season. It is looking increasingly likely it will be away from Naples."
Inter loanee Romelu Lukaku drops fresh hint about Chelsea future,"May 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/inter-romelu-lukaku-drops-fresh-hint-chelsea,"The Belgian forward joined Inter during the 2022 summer transfer window following an extremely disappointing season at Chelsea. Lukaku managed a measly eight Premier League goals for the club after being signed for a whopping Â£97.5m.  The 30-year-old's form has picked up in recent weeks for Inter after initially struggling upon his return to San Siro. He has bagged six goals and contributed four assists in his last eight appearances, with the club's form leading to a first appearance in the Champions League final since 2010. 90min revealed in April that Lukaku had made it known that staying at Inter was his priority, and speaking to Het Laatste Nieuws, he reiterated his feeling of belonging to the Serie A giants. ""I was good at Chelsea last season. But I knew then that if it didnât work out at Chelsea, I still had Inter,"" Lukaku said. ""When I signed again, I knew: I belong here. I had that too at Anderlecht. I take this club seriously. I want to do my best. The people here see that. Being encouraged here is the best thing there is."" feed Lukaku's comments back up what Inter CEO Giuseppe Marotta recently told Radio Rai, saying that he believes the player is 'very comfortable' at San Siro but that his future depends what Chelsea want to do. ""Romelu loves the shirt he wears, he is very comfortable at Inter. These are fundamental aspects, this desire of his to be with us,"" Marotta remarked. ""But he is on loan until June 30. He will return toÂ Chelsea, and we don't know what will happen on a technical level at that club. At the moment we are at the window."" Lukaku previously scored 64 goals in 95 appearances for Inter to earn his big-money move to Stamford Bridge. He formed a dynamic partnership with Lautaro Martinez up front - which continues to flourish to this day - and previously enjoyed a hugely successful spell with Everton in the Premier League. A two-season stay at Manchester United between 2017 and 2019 was regarded as a failure by many, though he still scored 42 goals in 96 appearances in red - 27 of those coming in his first season at Old Trafford."
Mason Mount set for meeting with Chelsea hierarchy amid Man Utd links,"May 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/mason-mount-set-for-meeting-chelsea-hierarchy-man-utd-links,"The 24-year-old midfielder is entering the final 12 months of his current deal at Stamford Bridge, and the club have been embroiled in lengthy discussions with the player regarding a contract extensions. The delay in a new deal being agreed upon has sparked interest from Liverpool, and 90min also understands that Arsenal have registered their interest with Mount's representatives. Manchester United has also been thrown into the mix regarding a potential Â£55m bid for Mount, while sources have stated that Newcastle United, who secured UEFA Champions League qualification on Monday, are keeping an eye on how negotiations are panning out. Chelsea's imminent appointment of Mauricio Pochettino has led to new confidence at the Blues that Mount will indeed rebuke interest from elsewhere to sign a new long-term deal. In light of Pochettino's proposed hiring, 90min recently reported that the club had planned to accelerate talks with Mount's representatives, and they will sit down with the midfielder next week. feed Pochettino is believed to be a huge fan of Mount and wants him to be a part of his Chelsea project moving forward. The England international has struggled with form and fitness this season as the Blues have woefully underperformed under three different managers. In just 20 Premier League starts, the midfielder has managed a measly three goals and two assists. Prior to this season's woes, however, Mount was one of Chelsea's most consistent performers, winning the club's player of the year award in 2020/21 and 2021/22."
Barcelona shocked by Jules Kounde transfer plan,"May 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-shocked-jules-kounde-transfer-plan,"The France international has been an integral part of Xavi's side this term, wrestling back La Liga from Real Madrid and winning their first title since 2019. However, reports from Spain on Tuesday revealed that Kounde has grown increasingly frustrated with being played at right-back as opposed to his natural centre-back and will look to engineer an exit from Camp Nou. 90min understands that Barcelona are surprised with this development and are not impressed with Kounde. Barca's financial woes and need to meet La Liga's feasibility plans means they may need to sell key players in order to bring in top transfer targets. Kounde was not someone thought to have been on the chopping block but his sudden change of heart could change the club's stance. Barcelona director Mateu Alemany was asked about Kounde's future on Tuesday evening, but insisted that the club will 'resolve internal situations internally'. feed Kounde is on huge wages at Barcelona and they would demand a fee of roughly â¬80m, which could make him hard to shift despite his intentions to find a new club. Barcelona are known admirers of Bayern Munich's Benjamin Pavard - another French defender comfortable at right-back and centre-back - and there have been suggestions they could try and package a deal that would send Kounde to Bavaria in return. 90min reported last week that Barcelona are also among a list of elite European clubs that have been alerted to the possible availability of Bayern midfielder Joshua Kimmich. Kounde was courted by Chelsea - then manged by current Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel - for two years prior to last summer's move to Catalonia. Newcastle have also shown an interest in Kounde in the not too distant past."

"Arsenal, Man City & PSG among sides interested in Zenit winger Malcom","May 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-man-city-psg-among-sides-interested-zenit-winger-malcom,"Malcom, formerly of Bordeaux and Barcelona, has enjoyed a sensational campaign out on the right side of Zenit's attack, racking up 23 goals and nine assists from just 27 top-flight outings this season. The 26-year-old is understood to believe he is ready for a return to one of Europe's top leagues and sources have confirmed to 90min that his agents have spoken with Zenit to try and engineer a move away this summer. Those same representatives have reached out to a number of sides from across Europe to try and find suitors for Malcom, and it is understood that plenty of teams have voiced an interest in getting a deal done. Indeed, 90min understands that Arsenal, Manchester City and Newcastle have all been alerted to Malcom's potential availability, while Paris Saint-Germain are also known admirers after failing to get a deal over the line in the January transfer window. feed Zenit are well aware of the interest in Malcom but, given he signed a new deal last summer to tie himself to the Russian side until 2027, they are prepared to demand a significant fee for his services. Sources have told 90min that Zenit are set to demand upwards of the Â£40m with which they parted to sign Malcom from Barcelona in 2019. The Russian side are also braced for potential approaches for another Brazilian, 19-year-old defender Robert Renan. Renan, who only joined Zenit in January, has long been tracked by teams across Europe. Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Newcastle and Tottenham are all known admirers of the centre-back, who was handed a maiden call-up to the Brazil national team back in March."
Man Utd exploring signing two centre forwards this summer,"May 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-exploring-signing-two-centre-forwards-this-summer,"United are one point from confirming their qualification for next season's Champions League and can rubber stamp their return to the competition by avoiding defeat at home to Chelsea on Thursday night, in their penultimate league game of the season. Fulham visit Old Trafford on Sunday before United's showdown with Manchester City in the FA Cup final on June 3. Notably, Erik ten Hag's side have only managed 52 goals in the league over 36 games - the second lowest total in the top half of the table. Ten Hag has often criticised his team's inability to kill matches off while leading, and United followed a similar trend in their 1-0 win over Bournemouth last weekend. The Dutchman is keen for United to address the problem over the summer and as 90min has reported, Tottenham talisman Harry Kane is the club's top transfer target. Despite Kane's 28 league goals this season, Spurs have endured a miserable season which will see them finish between seventh and ninth in the table - and likely out of Europe altogether. Kane has one year left on his deal with Spurs and United sense a better opportunity than ever before to finally sign one of their most-wanted players from the past decade. It's understood that there is not huge confidence at United that they will be able to secure a deal for Kane with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy, who has garnered a reputation for being a tough negotiator even dating back to the days where United signed Michael Carrick and Dimitar Berbatov from the north London club. Tottenham want a minimum of Â£100m for Kane and while United will explore if they can pull off the move, 90min understands they will be prepared to move on to other targets should Spurs drag their heels. Tottenham run the risk of losing Kane for free in a year's time should they be unable to convince Kane to extend his contract, so Kane is in a more powerful position than at any time before. feed Ten Hag wants United to secure their targets as early as possible in the summer, ideally in time for their pre-season tour of the US and certainly before the Premier League resumes in August. The uncertainty over the club's ownership situation complicates the matter further but United have already identified their targets - it will soon be about making advances. Any fee for Kane would likely break United's transfer record, and while the club also hold interest in Napoli's Victor Osimhen, his price is understood to be a significant stumbling block. There are fears in the club that a deal for the Nigerian could reach Â£130m - a near Â£40m increase on their current transfer record, and such an outlay would limit their options to strengthen in other areas. Both Kane and Osimhen are in a first ""box"" of targets which comprises of ready-made options to fill the central striking void, with Inter's Lautaro Martinez and Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic also considered. 90min reported in January of United's early interest in the Serbian, who could be the most attainable of the four at present, despite Juventus' public statement that the player is not for sale. United have been following Vlahovic since before his move to Turin, which hasn't gone to plan for the 23-year-old, and there is growing confidence that he would like to join - there are certainly indications from the player's camp that he would like to move to England. Those within United aren't deterred by the difficult spell at Juventus and have confidence that a coach like Ten Hag could, as he has done with a number of players at United to date, bring the best out of the player. Vlahovic's price would likely sit in the Â£70m-Â£80m range and allow United room for manoeuvre with other options, and while central midfield is a high priority position to strengthen, United would like there to be room in the budget to put towards a second centre forward from a second ""box"" of younger options. Evan Ferguson is liked by United but recently signed a new deal with Brighton and looks unattainable this year, while Rasmus Hojlund, Santiago Gimenez and Goncalo Ramos are among other promising striking prospects who could integrate into the squad in the long term. Benjamin Sesko and Mohammed Kudus also come recommended by club scouts. Kudus in particular finds himself in an interesting situation, having already worked with Ten Hag at Ajax, while he can play in a number of positions - from both the right side and at number 10 as well as through the middle. The Ghanaian would offer United valuable versatility, which they lack in both the central and right sided positions in attack. The player's agent recently stated that this summer is the ""right time"" for Kudus and Ajax to part ways, while he has also rejected the option to extend his deal through 2026. Ajax may be more willing sellers to United or any other interested party, such as Newcastle United, this summer compared to last, given they are unlikely at best to qualify for next season's Champions League. ""I think it is best for both Ajax and Mohammed that he makes a transfer now. Now is the right time,"" said Kudus' agent, Jennifer Mendelewitsch, to De Telegraaf.  ""He has ignored a proposal to extend his contract until the summer of 2026. What I can say is that after the World Cup and this season there is a lot of interest in Kudus."" Kudus' price is likely to fall in the Â£30m-Â£40m range and would represent a valuable, versatile outlet that Ten Hag is familiar with, who could also fit into the shape of the squad alongside a more established name to take the burden of scoring the goals.  He would also represent a younger alternative to Neymar, who United have been linked with this week in France. It's understood by 90min that United are being kept informed on the Brazilian's future developments - as is commonplace for leading clubs and high profile players - but there is no active interest on United's end. United see their attack as the primary area to fix before next season, as Wout Weghorst's loan will end in early June and Anthony Martial, who signed for United eight years ago, is a player United are actively looking to sell. The Frenchman has struggled for the duration of the season with injuries and Ten Hag has internally indicated his willingness to part with the player."
Middlesbrough braced for Premier League interest in Hayden Hackney,"May 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/middlesbrough-braced-premier-league-interest-hayden-hackney,"The 20-year-old, who previously enjoyed a loan stint at Scunthorpe, has quickly become of Michael Carrick's most trusted performers after graduating from the club's youth academy, earning a regular place in midfield. Hackney signed a new long-term deal with Middlesbrough in December, but 90min understands that he could be rewarded with another contract such has been his progress. However, with the club failing to earn promotion to the Premier League after losing their two-legged play-off semi-final with Coventry, it does mean that a large offer could see him sold. Boro are not in a position financially to reject reasonable offers for their big names - they no longer receive financial assistance in the form of parachute payments - and it's expected that they will have to sell this summer to buy. Chuba Akpom, the club's leading goalscorer during 2022/23 with 28 Championship goals, is set to leave in a big money deal this summer, but Boro are fearful that Hackneyâs form could attract some of the Premier Leagueâs top clubs. feed 90min understands that Arsenal and Liverpool have both checked on the 20-year-old, while local rivals Newcastle, as well as Nottingham Forest and Leicester City, have also taken an interest in his recent performances. Hackney's international future is also the subject of contention, with England ready to take on Scotland this summer in a bid to commit him to the Three Lions. Having played for England at Under-15 level, Hackney - who qualifies for Scotland via his mother - was called up to their Under-21 squad in November and played. However, sources have told 90min that England want Hackney back in their fold and are ready to hand him a call-up to their Under-21 squad this summer - leaving the Teessider with a big decision to make."
Tottenham join list of Premier League clubs interested in Santiago Gimenez,"May 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-premier-league-clubs-interested-santiago-gimenez,"Spurs are eyeing Feyenoord manager Arne Slot and have eyes on midfielder Orkun Kokcu, but Gimenez has also caught their eye. The north London club is currently monitoring the forward as the summer transfer window fast approaches, but they are not the only ones in the race. As previously reported by 90min, Aston Villa, Brentford, Brighton, Crystal Palace and relegation-threatened Leicester stand among those keeping a close eye on Gimenez. Several clubs in France, Italy and Germany remain interested as well, namely Lille, Eintracht Frankfurt and Napoli. No official offers have yet been made to Feyenoord, however. Gimenez adjusted quickly to the Dutch Eredivisie after arriving ahead of the 2022/23 campaign, scoring 23 goals so far this season in all competitions. But it's his recent form - 11 goals in his last 10 appearances and scoring in eight consecutive Eredivisie away games - that has attracted interest from across Europe. The Mexico international's contributions inspired Feyenoord to Eredivisie title glory, leading the league with 82 points in 33 games to beat giants Ajax and PSV to the championship. feed There is a thought among interested teams suggesting that Gimenez would benefit from another year in the Eredivisie, sources have added. Nevertheless, the fast-paced nature of the transfer market could result in an immediate move. Feyenoord general manager Dennis te Kloese previously insisted they are not interested in selling Gimenez. ""He's an important player for us, he is not for sale, we are not interested,"" Te Kloese said. ""I feel, and it is my humble opinion, that Santiago has to keep up with this rhythm, get even stronger, take advantage of the fact that he is here in a team that could stand out at a high European level next year and those experiences are not going to be taken away from him."" ""So he will go forward very calmly, step by step and we will help him, push him, trying to create the best circumstances for him to stand out, because it is good for him and for the club.""

Barcelona are confident that they can reach an agreement to bring the forward back to Camp Nou, though they face competition from Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal. But in an interview with ESPN Argentina, Martinez put forth an offer to Messi to link up with him at Aston Villa. ""If Leo is whistled, I would bring him to Aston Villa. I would bait him with a mate [tea], I'd make roasts for him every weekend, I'd ask people to make little flags for him and he has a good time. I will reduce my salary for Messi if necessary,"" Martinez said.

Tottenham interested in Feyenoord star amid Arne Slot talks,"May 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-interested-in-feyenoord-star-amid-arne-slot-talks,"90min revealed on Monday that Feyenoord boss Arne Slot has informed the club he would like to take the head coach job at Spurs, and negotiations over a compensation figure could be thrashed out this week. Feyenoord director Dennis te Kloese has also revealed that he himself has received an offer from Tottenham, but has turned it down. Slot has worked wonders in his two seasons at De Kuip, leading Feyenoord to the Europa Conference League final last year before winning a first Eredivisie title since 2017 this term. He could be followed from Rotterdam to north London could be club captain Kokcu. 90min understands that Spurs were interested in the Turkey international even before talks for Slot accelerated. Still only 22, Kokcu has scored 12 goals and provided five assists in 45 games for Feyenoord this season, while he has been linked to Arsenal and Brighton in recent months. feed Kokcu made headlines in October 2022 when he refused to wear a rainbow captain's armband in support of the LGBTQ+ community, citing religious reasons for the snub. ""I have decided not to wear the rainbow captain's armband this round,"" he said at the time. ""I think it's important to emphasise that I respect everyone regardless of religion, background or preference. I believe that everyone is free to do what they want or feel. I fully understand the importance of this action, but because of my religious beliefs, I don't feel the right person to support this. ""That's why I don't feel comfortable wearing this captain's armband. I can imagine some people are disappointed with this. That is absolutely not my intention, although I realise that I may not immediately be able to take away that feeling with these words.

I don't know whatâs happening in these players' heads, the education they've had, what's been put into their heads,"" Rongier said. ""That all needs to be taken into account. But I also think it's a communication issue. The players need to be told that wearing this shirt isn't like parading at Gay Pride. It's just to say that we need to combat homophobia because there are injustices, people who are attacked or killed because they are homosexual, and that in 2023 that kind of situation should no longer happen. It's impossible. We should focus on that - fighting injustice. ""But it's difficult to talk about without stirring up controversy. I wouldn't be able to give my opinion on it. But in our dressing room, there was no discussion. We know that there is a matchday dedicated to the LGBT community. To agree with it or not is one thing, but we're not asking the players to go parade in the streets in support of it. It's just a shirt."""
Xavi rates Barcelona's chances of re-signing Lionel Messi,"May 22, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/xavi-rates-barcelona-chances-re-signing-lionel-messi,"Messi's contract with Paris Saint-Germain will expire at the end of the season and he will not extend his deal with the French giants. 90min revealed earlier in May BarÃ§a are 'hugely confident' of bringing the World Cup winner back to Camp Nou, even in the face of interest from Al Hilal.

Robert Lewandowski has also publicly urged the World Cup winner to return to the club he scored 672 goals for. manual ""I want to play with Messi here in Barcelona. He has changed his style in recent years. It is easier to play with players who understand football as deeply as he does,"" said the Polish striker. ""Messi's playing style has evolved in recent years. He thinks differently, and positions himself differently on the pitch. He has a unique sense. We would definitely use it."" Barcelona are currently awaiting La Liga's approval of a viability plan, which would enable them to register players who have recently signed new contracts and pursue further signings. Messi is set to feature in PSG's remaining 2022/23 fixtures against Strasbourg and Clermont Foot."

Alvarez was keen for Ajax to accept it, seeing the opportunity as too good to turn down. He even refused to train in an attempt to force a transfer. But a major issue for Ajax was the transfer window for Dutch clubs closing 24 hours earlier than the rest of Europe due to an administrative error, leaving the Eredivisie club with no time to source a replacement were they to sell. feed Alavrez, who has played 43 times for Ajax in all competitions this season as a holding midfielder or occasional centre-back, later expressed hope that the chance would come again. ""I am very disappointed about it,"" he toldÂ ESPN in October, shortly before heading to the 2022 World Cup with Mexico.Â ""But I am convinced that one day another big club will come for me. This winter, or in the summer. For now, I can only focus on Ajax."" Manchester United, Arsenal and West Ham are the other clubs who have watched Alvarez over the past 12 months and considered him an option. But 90min understands that Dortmund, who are expected to sell Jude Bellingham to Real Madrid this summer, are confident they will strike a deal. Dortmund are on the verge of a first Bundesliga title since 2012 and will get their hands on the trophy as long as they beat Mainz at home in the final game on Saturday, or if 10-time back-to-back reigning champions Bayern Munich drop points on their visit to Koln."

Inter CEO takes swipe at Chelsea while discussing Romelu Lukaku's future,"May 23, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/inter-ceo-takes-swipe-chelsea-while-discussing-romelu-lukaku-future,"Lukaku first joined the Nerazzurri back in 2019 for a club-record â¬80m fee from Manchester United. In his second season at San Siro, he fired Inter to a first Serie A title in over a decade. With Inter feeling the pinch due to financial woes, Lukaku was sold to Chelsea for over â¬100m in 2021, but he scored just 15 goals in 44 games back at Stamford Bridge in a season during which he publicly admitted he would like to play for Inter again.

Xavi reveals Barcelona's main transfer priority for summer window,"May 22, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/xavi-reveals-barcelona-main-transfer-priority-for-summer-window,"Contrary to the expectations of many fans, who believed Barcelona would prioritise a right-back signing to address the ongoing positional issue, Xavi has revealed that their primary concern lies in bolstering the midfield. This decision stems from the imminent departure of the club's long-serving captain Sergio Busquets, who will bid farewell to Barcelona after an illustrious 15-year tenure. Jules Kounde has been filling in at right-back for a significant portion of the season, highlighting the pressing need for reinforcement in that position. However, Xavi's focus remains steadfast on revitalising the midfield unit, recognising the impact of Busquets' imminent departure on the team dynamics. ""Busi is leaving, and we need a high-level defensive midfielder. An important, differential footballer is leaving us. And we have to replace him. The more we strengthen ourselves, weâll be more competitive,"" Xavi told reporters.  The Barcelona manager also addressed recent criticism from Real Sociedad's sporting director, Robert Fernandez, who condemned Xavi for discussing midfielder Martin Zubimendi.  âThe Real Sociedad sporting director was angry because I talked about Zubimendi, but it is you who ask me about him. I donât want to destabilise any other teams."" Real Sociedad boss Imanol Alguacil has recently relayed his confidence that Zubimendi will not leave the club in the summer, saying: ""I know what Zubimendi thinks and wants. I have no doubt he wants to play in the Champions League with us next year. Zubimendi has a contract with us, itâs the best place he can be, and he wants to be with us.â Xavi was also asked about Joshua Kimmich as a target for Barcelona this summer, and he said: ""Kimmich is spectacular in my opinion, one of the best in his position.â 90min understands that Kimmich may become a target from several clubs across Europe, including Barcelona, as he considers his future at Bayern Munich. The German club, however, want to re-sign him on a new contract and would rather keep their star man at the club.  As the club prepares for life without Busquets, the search for a capable replacement intensifies. The task at hand involves identifying a player who possesses the necessary skills, vision, and tactical understanding to contribute effectively not only to Barcelona's midfield, but Barcelona's new era under Xavi.

Navas came to the club following fellow loanee Dean Henderson suffered a season-ending injury in mid-January - tearing his thigh muscle in a win over Leicester City.  However, despite Forest wanting Navas to stay, 90min has been told that he has clubs interested in his services from all over the world as he enters the final year of a three-year deal at PSG. Atletico Madrid are among those linked, but there is interest from all over Europe, the Middle East, MLS and South America thanks in large part of his exceptional showings at Forest.  Despite interest from across the world, Forest are confident that they can persuade Navas to return to the City Ground on a longer term deal.  feed Another loan star Forest are keen to keep hold of beyond the 2022/23 season is Lodi, who joined from Atletico Madrid last summer. The full-back has been a consistent performer for Steve Cooper's side, playing 27 league games.  Forest had an option to purchase Lodi for Â£25m, but that option has now expired and talks with Atletico are needed to secure an alternative deal.

He scored 22 goals in all competitions for Real last season, earning him a 2022 Ballon d'Or nomination, and has eclipsed that with 23 this season. But the Brazilian has repeatedly been targeted with racist chanting and abuse over the course of the campaign. The incident at the Mestalla over the weekend was just the latest episode. Vinicius has openly criticised La Liga's response to the various incidents this season and has claimed in the wake of the Valencia game that 'racism is normal' within the competition. ""The championship that once belonged to Ronaldinho, Ronaldo, Cristiano [Ronaldo] and [Lionel] Messi today belongs to racists,"" he said, adding that his native Brazil now considers Spain 'a country of racists' as a result. feed But the 22-year-old does not intend to let racism drive him out of La Liga. 90min has learned from Real Madrid sources that the club is furious with the ongoing problem. They are firmly backing Vinicius and are determined to fight La Liga or anyone else to get justice for him. Vinicius himself is not seeking to leave and remains happy at Real. His relationship with coach Carlo Ancelotti, who is under contract until at least the end of next season is also a main reason why the player is keen to continue in the Spanish capital. Ancelotti has helped Vinicius unlock his potential since returning to the club in 2021, overseeing the player's transformation from talented youngster to decisive game-changer."

Speaking to Ziggo Sport Voetbal earlier this week, De Jong admitted he had a 'situation' with BarÃ§a president Joan Laporta due to a willingness to sell him and ease their financial woes. And in a fresh interview with fellow Dutch broadcaster NOS, he revealed that Man Utd indeed tried to prise him away from Camp Nou. ""Manchester United already spoke with Barcelona [last summer] despite the fact that I wanted to stay here,"" De Jong said. He added: ""The club was in a difficult situation. They were able to sell me for a big fee, and they wanted to do this, but I did not want to leave so I stayed. ""If everything goes well for me and for the club, then I want to stay here for as long as possible."" feed Man Utd did wind up bringing in midfield reinforcements in Christian Eriksen and Casemiro, while De Jong remained at Barcelona and helped them win a first La Liga title since 2019.

Though talks are ongoing, the forward has not yet committed his long-term future to Man Utd and there has been minor but growing unrest among fans that their star forward could leave. Ten Hag was asked about Rashford's contract situation ahead of Saturday's trip to Bournemouth and if he knew the reasons why a new deal hasn't been signed yet. ""Yes, I know [why], but I don't talk about the process. Let the process go,"" Ten Hag replied. ""Once again, this is not important at the moment for me or Rashy.

Back in December 2022 ahead of Everton's 1-1 draw at Manchester City, Lampard said: ""[Haaland] is an amazing player and the ultimate top level players generally can do what he does in a top level league. ""I coached against him in a pre-season game when he was playing for Salzburg. I tried to sign him for Chelsea and it was not to be. ""It was clear in our pre-match preparation what this boy was. Fair play to him. We are going against him and I respect those at the top of their game. I watched the World Cup final with [Kylian] Mbappe and [Lionel] Messi and Haaland has got himself in that bracket at a very young age."" feed Ahead of Chelsea's trip to Man City on Sunday - a game which is expected to end with the hosts lifting the Premier League trophy - Lampard reiterated that he saw Haaland's potential in the summer of 2019. It was initially put to Lampard that the Norwegian has scored as many Premier League goals this season as Chelsea (36), to which he retorted: ""It's a fantastic stat from him. I know the Chelsea side is another story. I tried to sign him when I was last here. I was really keen to get him here but it couldn't happen. ""His level was really clear at that point as well. We had played him in a pre-season game at Salzburg and he was fantastic. I love seeing players at that level and with that personality to be the best which he has proven to be. ""I think he is special and thought he would adapt straight away because of his level. I thought because of his record scoring for his country and in Austria that he would come into a good unit already would have been a recipe to help him.

""People talk about mistakes in football and I don't know if it was that but I was pushing for him and a few other players.

Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United have all be contacted, while in mainland Europe, conversations have been held with Barcelona, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain.

Bayern are aware of the growing interest in Kimmich's services but are currently adamant that they will not sell the midfielder. Kimmich has lifted seven Bundesliga titles during his time in Munich and is on track for an eight, with Bayern currently leading the table with two games remaining.

The reported eight-figure transfer will see AraÃºjo remain with the club through June 24. Atlanta has not made comments yet.  The Georgia club acquired AraÃºjo from Ligue 1 side Lille in 2021 for a reported transfer fee of $11.8 million, making him ATLâs highest paid player with a reported salary nearing the $4.5 million mark. The much-anticipated Designated player was employed primarily as a right winger and has contributed 11 goals and 12 assists in 56 appearances with the club, failing to impact the team as was originally desired. This could prove to be a busy summer for Atlanta now that a DP slot opens for the July 5 transfer window that runs through August 2. There is speculation that the team will entertain offers for Thiago Almada who is on a potential MVP run with six goals and six assists in 11 matches, fullback Caleb Wiley who is currently prepping with the USMNT for the U20 World Cup in Argentina this month, and center back Miles Robinson whose contract runs out at the end of this season. Club president Garth Lagerwey and vice president Carlos Bocanegra have already alluded to the clubâs transfer activity, hinting to the possibility of player additions as they sit momentarily fourth in the Eastern Conference with 21 points, six behind conference punter Cincinnati. Head coach Gonzalo Pineda has drawn negative attention and is under pressure to return the team to previous glories.

Loftus-Cheek is approaching the final 12 months of his contract at Stamford Bridge and, due to Chelsea's new policy of trying to avoid players entering the last two years of their deals, is one of a number of players on whom decisions will be made this summer. The Blues are aware of the need to sell players as soon as possible and 90min understands that talks with Milan over Loftus-Cheek are close to reaching a positive resolution. feed Chelsea are keen to agree to the permanent departure of Loftus-Cheek, whose status as an academy graduate would make his sale even more beneficial in terms of Financial Fair Play. It is understood that a permanent transfer is on the cards in the coming weeks, although at this point, a loan deal with an obligation for Milan to sign Loftus-Cheek permanently next summer has not yet been ruled out. Chelsea do have a one-year extension clause in the midfielder's contract which would make this possible. Milan are also known admirers of Kalidou Koulibaly, Christian Pulisic, Hakim Ziyech and Callum Hudson-Odoi, but it is Loftus-Cheek who has been the focus of their efforts thus far. There has been Premier League interest in Loftus-Cheek from Crystal Palace, Fulham, Leicester, Newcastle, West Ham and Wolves, but the English midfielder is believed to be intrigued by the idea of linking up with Tomori in Italy."

Adingra was quickly sent on loan to Union, the feeder club where Kaoru Mitoma spent last season before going on to become a regular at the Amex Stadium in 2022/23. The relationship between the teams was established when Brighton chairman Tony Bloom became majority shareholder in 2018. For Union, who were only promoted back to the Belgian top flight in 2021 after 48 years away and immediately went on to finish second, Adingra has been a big hit. feed The 21-year-old has made 48 appearances in all competitions, scoring 14 goals and providing a further 14 assists from his role as either a left winger or central striker.

Union were knocked out by Xabi Alonsoâs Bayer Leverkusen in the last eight, but Adingra left an impression on the Bundesliga side. 90min understands that Leverkusen are keen on signing on the Brighton player, as are Europa League holders Eintracht Frankfurt. The interest hasnât been limited to Germany either, with Ligue 1 trio Marseille, Monaco and Lyon also keeping an eye on him. However, from Brightonâs perspective, there is no desire to sell. Adingra has been informed by the club that there is a long-term vision for his future with them, which includes becoming a member of the first-team fairly soon.

""The plan is to finish the season well, win the Premier League, try against Man Utd in the FA Cup final, and then Inter,â he told Canal+. âAfter that, this summer, weâll see what happens.â Sources have confirmed to 90min that Silva plans to wait until the end of the season and will not make a decision on his future until he learns whether Barcelona will have the financial means to pursue a transfer. The La Liga side have submitted a feasibility plan to league officials in the hope of being granted permission to sign new players, with their number one priority securing the return of Lionel Messi. Should neither Barcelona nor PSG formalise their interest, then Silva, whose current contract has just two years left to run, could be tempted to extend his six-year stay with City."
Jordan Henderson argues against Liverpool rebuild claims,"May 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jordan-henderson-argues-against-liverpool-rebuild,"Jurgen Klopp's side are in pursuit of a top-four finish which looked nearly impossible just a few months ago, with Liverpool spending the vast majority of the campaign lost in mid-table obscurity before a huge upturn in form. Wherever Liverpool end up finishing, the need to refresh the squad is clear and Henderson is braced for the challenges that come with introducing a number of new faces. ""I donât think itâs a rebuild to be honest,"" he told PA, at an NHS Charities Together event in Crewe. ""I do think there will be new players coming in. A rebuild is changing an entire team â which I donât think we will be doing. ""I think you have a lot of core players in the team that will still be there and are still in great shape to compete and be successful. But yes, it will need freshening up of course with players leaving and trying to improve the team. feed ""I am sure players will be coming in at some point to give us a boost and freshen things up a bit and hopefully put us in good position come the first game of the season."" Midfield is expected to be the main focal point of Liverpool's transfer business this summer. Having accepted defeat in their pursuit of Borussia Dortmund's Jude Bellingham, the Reds are looking at a number of alternatives and have added the likes of Mason Mount and Alexis Mac Allister, of Chelsea and Brighton respectively, to their shortlist. ""Itâs always a challenge, especially at Liverpool, there will always be challenges for places and to play games,"" said Henderson when asked how the Reds' summer plans could impact him personally. ""Thatâs the case ever since I came to the club. Come pre-season Iâll be ready for the challenge again. ""Motivation never changes really, it is always about improving and being better, individually and as a team. Always new challenges come along, different things will happen and you will have new challenges throughout the season. ""There is always a challenge in football to improve, to be better and that motivation always stayed the same to be successful. ""Iâm confident we can reach the levels we are capable of again, definitely. We have shown that over the past six or seven games and itâs about continuing on that path from now until the end of the season and pick up where we left off hopefully."""
Erling Haaland's agent stokes fire of 'mystery' Man City release clause,"May 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/erling-haaland-agent-man-city-release-clause,"Haaland joined City last summer, signing a contract which did include a bumper release clause, although it is believed that Pep Guardiola's recent contract extension triggered a change in the terms of the agreement, perhaps even removing it altogether. There have been suggestions that the clause has been removed altogether, but when asked for an update, Haaland's agent Rafaela Pimenta, remained coy and, if anything, fuelled the uncertainty surrounding his future. ""I have nothing to clarify,"" she told Mundo Deportivo. ""The mystery of this story is very cute because you don't know where it is, like a treasure chest. Anyway, as a lawyer, I can't reveal the details of contracts."" Haaland is known to be interested in testing himself across Europe, with Real Madrid keen to land the 22-year-old's signature further down the line. ""[Haaland can go] wherever he wants,"" Pimenta continued. ""He is a player that has never been seen before. feed ""For me, his quality in everything and his ability to evolve are very impressive. He is capable of adapting quickly to a new club, new city, new coach... it's as if he has always been there. That gives you a lot of peace of mind and allows you to move forward. ""He is very calm in his professional and personal life, he has the quality. Today, he is in the right place, with the right team and the right coach. ""In Brazil, we say that the sky is the limit. I think he is going to break all the records."" Pimenta, who later admitted she did not know whether Haaland would ever play in La Liga, ended by discussing her relationship with Real Madrid president Florentino Perez. ""Strangely, I have only spoken with Florentino once in my life,"" she said.Â ""I cannot explain the reason, but above all I have a good relationship of great respect and admiration with Jose Angel Sanchez and Juni Calafat.Â They are serious, humble people and I think they do a great job for Madrid."""

He made the surprising decision to move abroad having fallen out of favour under ex-Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel in 2021, bringing down the curtain on his Stamford Bridge career to head to the Stadio Olimpico. In an interview with TMW, the 25-year-old cited the need to progress in his career and not be seen solely as a young academy graduate. ""Everything I knew was Chelsea apart from a few loan moves, but even now, I think it was the right time to leave. I was ready to take a step forward in my career; I didn't want to be considered a youngster or a player who had just come from the academy. It was time for me to spread my wings,"" Abraham said. ""Just before I left Chelsea, [Fikayo] Tomori went to AC Milan and we talked a lot...I remember the phone calls; none of us could believe what was happening. We had been at Chelsea our whole lives and in a moment we were walking away."" feed Despite his departure, Abraham maintains contact with several Chelsea players as well as other stars at London sides. ""I still talk to so many Chelsea players, James always tells me to come back,"" he added.

Piers Morgan reveals Cristiano Ronaldo wanted Arsenal move in 2022,"May 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/piers-morgan-reveals-cristiano-ronaldo-wanted-arsenal-move-in-2022,"Ronaldo returned to Old Trafford at the end of the summer 2021 transfer window, though the Red Devils' title hopes were quickly dashed and they finished the season with their lowest points total in the Premier League era. The forward attempted to engineer an exit to any Champions League club last summer - Eintracht Frankfurt and Napoli are among the sides who have publicly claimed they were offered Ronaldo's services, while Bayern Munich and Chelsea were said to have contemplated deals before backing away. Ronaldo began the 2022/23 campaign as a bench player under incoming Man Utd manager Erik ten Hag, but he came in for disciplinary action after leaving the stadium before the end of a win against Tottenham in October. Shortly prior to the winter World Cup, Ronaldo delivered an explosive interview with Morgan lashing out against Man Utd's ownership and Ten Hag. He and the club quickly agreed terms over the mutual termination of his contract in the following days. Once again, Ronaldo was left without many suitors, and despite his wishes to remain in Europe, he ended up signing for Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr on a lucrative contract worth around Â£250m in total. feed However, notorious Arsenal fan Morgan - reeling from the Gunners' failed Premier League title charge - has claimed that his side would have benefitted with signing Ronaldo and that the forward informed him he was open to a move to the Emirates Stadium. ""Mock all you like, but if we'd signed Ronaldo when he left Utd, until the end of the season - as he was keen to do by the way - we would have won the league. He knows how to win major trophies, and how to score goals when it really matters,"" Morgan said on Twitter. While Morgan's Arsenal are almost certain to finish the season in second place to Manchester City in the Premier League, Ronaldo is likely to fail in his own bid to win the Saudi Pro League. Al Nassr sit three points behind Al Ittihad with only three games of the season remaining. Ronaldo has scored 13 goals and laid on two assists in 14 games since his move to the Middle East."
Martin Odegaard set for talks over new Arsenal contract,"May 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/martin-odegaard-set-for-talks-over-new-arsenal-contract,"Odegaard joined Arsenal permanently in the summer of 2021 after an impressive six-month loan spell, and has since gone on to establish himself as one of the Gunners' most important players. The 24-year-old is already club captain, highlighting his influence behind the scenes, but he has been just as important on the pitch with a return of 15 goals and eight assists in 35 Premier League games this year. Such is Odegaard's importance to Arsenal that the Gunners are keen to hand out a bumper new contract to reflect his emergence as one of the leading midfielders in the Premier League. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Odegaard's representatives are more than happy to sit down with Arsenal in the coming weeks with a view to an extension which will include a significant pay rise. feed Odegaard's current contract expires in 2025 and so Arsenal are under no pressure to thrash out a new deal, but there is an appreciation that the Norway international is deserving of a reward for his role in the team. The Gunners are hard at work planning their summer transfer strategy but are also working to finalise a handful of new contracts, with Odegaard the latest in a long line of players in negotiations over an extension. Goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale is expected to agree a new contract before the end of the month, while the long wait for Bukayo Saka's new deal is likely to come to an end in the near future as well after an agreement was reached back in February. Negotiations remain on with centre-back William Saliba, but midfielder Granit Xhaka could leave the club this summer after a collapse in talks."

Alemany had always insisted he wanted to finish his current work at Barcelona before beginning a new project work with Villa. Even so, the Premier League side believed they had pulled off a major coup in persuading him to link-up with head coach Unai Emery. Alemany is understood to have visisted Villa's training ground in Birmingham last week. But, crucially, he left without putting pen to paper on a contract. And now Villa have been rocked by the news that he will instead remain at Camp Nou after talks with president Joan Laporta. feed Alemany's current deal there is due to expire in 2024 and Laporta had agreed to let him leave early to join Villa. But now has come 180 degree U-turn on his original decision. 90min is told that Laporta always made it clear to Alemany that he would not stand in his way, but also that he wanted him to stay and help build the squad being put together for Xavi. The news will be a huge relief to Barcelona, who have been working on appointing a new sporting director with Deco in-line to replace Jordi Cruyff. Now Alemany will remain and work with Deco in his soon to be new role."
Crystal Palace confident of Wilfried Zaha contract extension,"May 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/crystal-palace-confident-of-wilfried-zaha-contract-extension,"Zaha has spent nearly his entire career with Palace, aside from a short-lived spell with Manchester United, but is approaching the final month of his current contract and has received plenty of interest from both England and mainland Europe. The Ivory Coast international has never hidden his desire to play in the Champions League and could get that with a move to Ligue 1 side Marseille, while Saudi Arabia's Al-Ittihad are understood to have lodged an offer. In England, Arsenal and Chelsea are both long-term admirers of Zaha but neither have made firm offers to the 30-year-old, who is now considering staying with Palace. Indeed, sources have confirmed to 90min that Palace are growing in confidence that their efforts to retain Zaha will lead to an agreement over a contract extension which could be worth close to Â£200,000 per week. feed Palace have enjoyed a sensational resurgence following the return of Roy Hodgson to the Selhurst Park dugout and have climbed their way up to 12th in the Premier League, comfortably steering themselves away from a relegation battle with a run of five wins and a draw in their last eight games. Among the stars of Palace's recent run have been Michael Olise and Ebere Eze. The former leads Palace's assist charts with ten, while Eze is the team's top scorer and reached double figures with his double in the 2-0 win over Bournemouth. Palace officials have started work on new contracts for both Olise and Eze who, alongside Zaha, are seen as cornerstones of the team, and there is hope that Zaha's potential extension would persuade both to commit their futures to the Eagles."
Dimitar Berbatov reveals why he expects Harry Kane to stay at Tottenham despite Man Utd interest,"May 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/dimitar-berbatov-expects-harry-kane-stay-tottenham-despite-man-utd-interest,"Kane has a year left to run on his contract and 90min understands talks over a new one are on hold until the club appoint a new head coach. While Spurs have struggled this season, Kane has become the all-time leading scorer for club and country, cementing his place in the history books. Bayern Munich, Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain are among the clubs interested in the England captain. Ex-Tottenham star Berbatov, speaking on behalf of Enterprise Rent-A-Car, explained to 90min why he simply cannot envisage Kane beginning next season at another club. Dimitar Berbatov was wanted by Man Utd in summer 2008. Daniel Levy dug his heels in before selling.Harry Kane may be in a similar situation this summer, but he doesnât see the same outcome this time.Spoke to Berba for @90min_Football this week courtesy of @UKEnterprise ð¤ pic.twitter.com/TYUZoAjprz ""Probably in the summer we're going to be witnessing again that type of saga, Kane going somewhere, that's TV soap opera,"" Berbatov said.  ""But at the same time, I don't think he's going to leave. I think his legacy with Spurs is so big now that you cannot tarnish it. Maybe you want to, but you will not allow yourself to do it because it's so big, you know? ""And you know, the goalscoring record and everything that he's achieved with Spurs - when you say Spurs, in my mind is Harry Kane. First thing in my mind, Kane. His story with Spurs is unbelievable. ""I think he's going to be staying there in my mind. The only thing I would wish for him is he's going to be scoring goals, probably break Alan Shearer's [Premier League] scoring record at some point. ""The only thing I want to wish [for] him is that maybe along the way he wins something as well."" Kane might stay put at Tottenham this summer in-part due to chairman Daniel Levy proving to be a notoriously tricky person to deal with in the transfer market - Berbatov's own move from Spurs to Man Utd famously left Sir Alex Ferguson claiming negotiating with him was worse than having his hip replaced. Berbatov opened up on this transfer saga, defending Levy for doing right by his club. ""Well, Daniel Levy is a businessman. He's defending his club. He's working in the interests of the club. And if I was in his place, I would do the same thing,"" Berbatov said. ""So he knows exactly what he wants, exactly how to get it. ""If there is going to be a negotiation, if United proceed and try to buy Kane, the negotiation will be very difficult for them, and they know that they've been there before with me, with [Michael] Carrick. At one point they'll they'll do it again. ""Is it going to be with Harry Kane? Well, let's wait and see. The price tag will be massive. But at the same time, as I said, I don't think it's going to happen. ""I think the legacy, sometimes players build legacies and you don't want to break it. Sometimes even legacies and records are more important than titles, depending on who you ask. So everybody needs to choose in this case. Harry Kane needs to trust what is important to him and then go and do it."""

Granit Xhaka set to leave Arsenal,"May 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/granit-xhaka-set-to-leave-arsenal-after-contract-talks-collapse,"90min recently reported that the midfielder had opted not continue talks over a new deal with the club, instead opting to assess his options elsewhere. Xhaka's current at Arsenal is due to expire at the end of 2024, and the club had been keen to keep hold of the Swiss international having been impressed by his attitude both on and off the pitch throughout the 2022/23 season.  However, Arsenal have accepted Xhaka's future now lies away from the Emirates Stadium and, as such, talks have taken place between the and Bayer Leverkusen over a deal worth in the region of â¬15m. A host of Bundesliga clubs have shown an interest in Xhaka, including former club Borussia Monchengladbach and Borussia Dortmund, but sources have confirmed to 90min that a move to Leverkusen is the player's preferred option. feed Leverkusen are now pushing ahead to try and tie up a deal, with talks accelerating in recent days after the midfielder made his choice known to them. Sources with knowledge of the situation have emphasised to 90min that the whole situation is 'amicable' and once Arsenal were aware that Xhaka saw his future elsewhere, they were happy to sanction a deal. It is understood Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta was keen to keep Xhaka at the club, appreciating the impact he has in the dressing room, but he has backed the club's decision to allow the Swiss to leave. Arteta previously played a pivotal role in keeping Xhaka at Arsenal in 2019 - when he was set to quit the club, after being booed off the pitch by fans and was later stripped of the captaincy. Xhaka insists Arteta was the only reason he stayed at Arsenal: ""There was one guy [who wanted me to stay], his name is Mikel Arteta,"" Xhaka said.  ""I will always support him, it doesnât matter what happens. Without him, I am 100 per cent sure I would not be in the club anymore.Â  ""He knows that, I have a very good and honest relationship with him. It doesnât matter what happens on the pitch, I will never ever be against him or say something against him. He deserves my respect, but the respect from my family as well. I was gone.

Will Declan Rice leave West Ham this summer?,"May 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/will-declan-rice-leave-west-ham-this-summer,"Such dreary stories in which seemingly no progress is ever made are features of the summer transfer window, and we've got to prepare ourselves for weeks and potentially months of stagnant Declan Rice updates.  The West Ham skipper has developed into one of Europe's leading midfielders by the tender age of 24, and there's no doubt that he's outgrown the east London club.  A big move beckons for Rice, but where the England international ends up is a mystery that may take a while to solve.  Rice rejected a bumper new deal in May 2022 that would've seen him become the highest-paid player in the club's history.  West Ham offered him a whopping eight-year extension, but Rice turned it down due to his desire to play Champions League football and compete for the highest honours.  Thus, the midfielder's current deal in east London expires in June 2024, although West Ham do have the option to extend his deal by another year which safeguards against them from losing Rice for nothing next summer, and gives them a little more leverage in negotiations with potential buyers. West Ham boss David Moyes slapped a Â£150m price tag on Rice's head last year, and it's understood the Hammers will be looking for a fee in excess of Â£100m for the midfielder's services this summer. The Irons are said to be paying close attention to Jude Bellingham's transfer situation and the fee Borussia Dortmund can garner for his sale. At this stage, reports on West Ham's valuation vary, but it appears that the club aren't too concerned about the player's contract situation. That certainly hasn't diminished his value severely in their eyes, and clubs may be forced to pay Â£120m to sign Rice this summer.  A whole host of Premier League clubs are keen on signing Rice. Chelsea have long been admirers of their former academy player, but a move to west London may depend on the future of Mason Mount. Rice is, of course, good friends with Mount, but it's unclear whether he'll remain at Chelsea beyond the summer.  There's nothing concrete, but Rice is reportedly keen on staying in London and the idea of working with Mikel Arteta and joining international teammates Bukayo Saka and Aaron Ramsdale at Arsenal certainly seems to have piqued his interest.  The West Ham skipper's admiration for the Gunners was clear in his pre-match notes which were displayed in the club program for Arsenal's visit in April. â[Arsenal] have had a strong season and have now got a real identity to the way they play under Mikel Arteta,â Rice wrote. âI obviously know a few of their players from England and they are not only top-class on the pitch but good boys off it. But of course those friendships will go out the window when we kick-off today!â Arsenal have been touted as the favourites to sign the Hammers star this summer, but it's unlikely that they'll match West Ham's current valuation given the other areas they need to address in their squad."
Brentford close in on new goalkeeper amid David Raya uncertainty,"May 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/brentford-close-new-goalkeeper-david-raya-uncertainty,"The Bees have secured a first-ever Premier League top-half finish with two games to spare and are still in the race for a Europa League or Conference League place.

Though they are expected to add Flekken to a goalkeeping group that also contains ex-Lazio stopper Thomas Strakosha, Brentford are adamant they will not sell the in-demand Raya unless the price is right and he could leave on a free transfer next summer instead. Raya, who is now a regular in Spain's setup despite never having played in his home country, has announced himself as one of the Premier League's best goalkeepers since Brentford's promotion in 2021. Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur are interested in Raya - 90min revealed on Tuesday that he is not the only current member of the Brentford setup on Spurs' radar - though both see Inter's Andre Onana as their preferred goalkeeper target. The Spaniard could end up signing for whichever club misses out on the Cameroonian. feed Head coach Thomas Frank has repeatedly insisted that the Bees would only entertain offers of Â£40m for Raya, even though he has just one year left to run on his contract and has publicly stated he has turned down two fresh offers. Speaking to The Athletic in February, Raya revealed why he turned down these deals. ""I turned down two contracts, one last year and one this January. They weren't the offers we were looking for. I can only say that,"" he said. ""I want to focus on playing games and not think too much about my future. I have a contract here, so I'm willing to finish that, but you never know what's going to happen in the summer. Maybe the club wants to sell, maybe not. Maybe I want to stay. I want to focus on football and see what happens. ""The club will decide the price and if a club wants to pay money, that will be it. I'm not worried about that. Iâm not in charge of that.

Sources have told 90min that while Benfica and Napoli have held talks with Kamada's camp, Milan are pushing hard to strike a deal and believe they are not far away from an agreement. Tottenham Hotspur have also long been fans of Kamada and had representatives at Frankfurt's 3-0 win at home to Mainz on Saturday. feed Evan Ndicka was also being monitored, but as 90min has reported, he is expected to sign for AS Roma on a free transfer.

Barcelona showed a willingness to sign him on a free transfer earlier this year but have since backed away from a deal. 90min understands that Ndicka could be on his way to Italy, with Europa League semi-finalists Roma confident of wrapping a deal up in the near future.

Raphinha drops biggest hint yet about future at Barcelona,"May 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/raphinha-drops-biggest-hint-yet-about-future-barcelona,"The 26-year-old joined the Catalan giants last summer in a deal worth up to Â£55m, having played a starring role for Leeds United for two seasons. The tricky Brazilian initially struggled to find form at Barca, as he failed to command a regular starting spot under Xavi, but has now tallied up 14 goal contributions in 32 La Liga appearances - a combination of seven goals and seven assists. Raphinha signed a five-year contract upon his arrival in Catalonia but his future at the club has already been called into question. 90min understands that Arsenal hold a strong interest in taking him back to England, while they are also interested in signing team-mate Ferran Torres. Newcastle and Chelsea have also been linked with moves - the latter came close to signing Raphinha before he put pen to paper with Barcelona - and the impending return of Lionel Messi from Paris Saint-Germain is likely to have an adverse effect on his playing time. Amid the ongoing speculation, Raphinha recently hit out at an 'uninformed and unprofessional' report that suggested he'd already agreed to move on this summer, and while celebrating the club's 27th La Liga title success, he again reiterated his desire to stay at Barca and continue winning trophies. feed ""I hope to be able to come back one more time,"" Raphinha told Barca TV (via Mundo Deportivo) aboard the club's open-top bus parade, before adding: ""...we worked hard for this, we knew what we wanted and to crown the League with this rÃºa is spectacular. It's better than I imagined. ""I would ask people to continue supporting us that next season we are going to try something more and go for the maximum titles that we can get"". Whether or not Barcelona could afford to turn down a bid for Raphinha remains to be seen. The club need to dramatically cut their wage bill if a fairytale return for Messi is to materialise, and they currently can't even afford to register the new contract of teenage sensation Gavi. As a result, 90min understands that offers for Raphinha, Torres and Ansu Fati will be considered, with Ousmane Dembele another who would be allowed to leave if a suitable offer came in."

Speaking after Liverpool's 3-0 win at Leicester City on Monday during which travelling fans chanted Firmino's name and heralded him at full-time, Klopp revealed there is a chance of the forward returning for their final home game of the season against Aston Villa. ""It [the chanting] was so cool. Iâve never seen anything like that [for somebody who wasn't playing],"" Klopp said. ""I think he has a chance of playing [against Villa]. We drive home, Tuesday is a day off - not for him but for the others - and then Wednesday he will be in team training, that is my information. ""We have to see. The Saturday game is a super difficult game for plenty of reasons. Probably farewell around the game for a few players, and then playing for absolutely everything against the second or third-best team in the Premier League for the second part of the season. That's super challenging. feed ""In the middle of everything, we have to win the game. But around that, we want to show the respect and appreciation and love we feel for not only Bobby but all the boys who will leave in the summer. It will be a special day with a difficult game in between."" After this weekend's game with Aston Villa, Liverpool end their season with a trip to Southampton. They remain in the hunt for a top-four finish following a run of seven successive wins, sitting just a point behind Manchester United and Newcastle United. 90min reported last summer that Juventus were interested in signing Firmino, though at that point Liverpool had no interest in letting him go. Firmino has since been tentatively linked with a move to Barcelona, who again are in need of signing players on free transfers due to their ongoing financial woes."

Man Utd among Premier League clubs still tracking Adrien Rabiot,"May 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-premier-league-clubs-still-tracking-adrien-rabiot,"The 28-year-old has been one of the better performers in Serie A throughout the 2022/23 season, putting in vastly-improved showings for a Juventus side who are now up to second in the table after three successive wins. Rabiot has bagged 11 goals in all competitions for La Vecchia Signora, after failing to score a single goal last season, and has also contributed four assists - form that has played him into contention for a new contract with his current deal up at the end of June. Negotiations have been ongoing with Rabiot's representatives about prolonging his stay at the Allianz Stadium and manager Massimiliano Allegri is understood to be a huge fan of the Frenchman. Notably, Rabiot himself is thought to he happy in Turin and is enjoying his time at the club. Nevertheless, the fact that talks with Rabiot's camp are yet to lead to an agreement has stoked the fire over a potential transfer away from the club. feed 90min revealed in March that Manchester United, Liverpool and Tottenham were keeping tabs on Rabiot's situation and they, alongside Arsenal, are continuing to monitor developments. The quartet believe that signing a player of Rabiot's calibre would represent excellent transfer business - United manager Erik ten Hag is also a known admirer - and would be willing to pounce if Juventus are unable to agree terms over a new deal. Rabiot opened the door to a move in December last year when he said that he'd be interested in moving to the Premier League, but more recently suggested that he could end up staying at Juventus, whom he joined from Paris Saint-Germain in 2019. Indeed, Rabiot opting to move to a different league could adversely affect his chances of getting into France's squad for the 2024 Euros, given the need to acclimatise to the pace and style of English football."
Mauricio Pochettino to retain Chelsea's interest in Declan Rice,"May 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/mauricio-pochettino-to-retain-chelsea-interest-declan-rice,"Pochettino is due to sign his contract at Stamford Bridge in the coming days and has already had plenty of opportunities to discuss his plans for the summer transfer window, including a desire to see midfielder Mason Mount handed a new contract. During those talks, the Chelsea board's long-standing interest in Rice was put to Pochettino and sources have confirmed to 90min that the Argentine would be keen to lure the West Ham man across London. Chelsea are looking to sign a new midfielder this summer. While they continue to push for a contract extension for N'Golo Kante, there are doubts over the futures of Mateo Kovacic, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Conor Gallagher and it is understood that strengthening in midfield is a key part of Pochettino's vision for the Blues. West Ham are prepared to part ways with Rice but are well aware of his value in the Premier League and would look for a fee of at least Â£100m to sell the midfielder, who still has two years remaining on his contract and would command an enormous fee even if he remains at the London Stadium for a further 12 months. feed Competition is also fierce for Rice, with the majority of the Premier League's elite all sensing an opportunity to lure the England international away this summer. Arsenal have emerged as a leading suitor and Rice is understood to be interested in a move to the Emirates, but there is also interest from Manchester City, Manchester United and Newcastle. As for Chelsea, the Blues have drawn up a long list of midfield targets aside from Rice and are known admirers of Southampton's Romeo Lavia and Borussia Monchengladbach's Manu Kone, among others. Pochettino is also eager for Chelsea to bolster in goal and at striker, with the Blues doing scouting work in both positions well before Graham Potter's dismissal from the dugout earlier this year."
Joan Laporta makes huge claim over Barcelona's pursuit of Lionel Messi,"May 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/joan-laporta-makes-huge-claim-barcelona-lionel-messi,"Messi is approaching the final month of his contract with Paris Saint-Germain and has long been in negotiations over an emotional return to Barcelona, who hope to receive the financial clearance from La Liga to announce a deal soon. Having sealed the La Liga title on Sunday night, Barcelona's attention is now firmly on transfer business, with Messi's return the top priority. ""We will do everything we can to bring Leo Messi back to Barcelona,"" Laporta told Jijantes FC in the immediate aftermath of the title triumph. On Monday morning, Laporta went further into his pursuit of Messi during an appearance on TV3, insisting the Argentine is pushing for a return to Camp Nou as well despite an enormous offer to move to Saudi Arabia. feed ""Leo is still in Paris in an unpleasant situation, I wouldn't want to bother him now,"" Laporta said. ""We will try to improve the team all over. ""I have spoken with Messi to address the situation. It was very nice. We have recovered our relationship. Messi wants Barca, he feels this club is his home, but speaking now would do him a disservice. ""Saudi Arabia? Barca is Barca. In Arabia they are doing a good job and investing, but I insist, Barca is his home."" Barcelona must lower their wage bill before they can make any further signings, and they have submitted a feasibility plan to La Liga in an attempt to prove their ability to get back under the salary cap. Sergio Busquets' imminent departure from Camp Nou will free up plenty of space on the wage budget, while a number of other players are also expected to be available for transfer in an attempt to raise more money."
Chelsea to step up Mason Mount contract talks after Mauricio Pochettino agreement,"May 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-mason-mount-contract-talks-mauricio-pochettino-agreement,"A full agreement has been reached with the former Tottenham boss, who will fly into London and put pen to paper on a contract in the coming days with a view to taking over from Frank Lampard at the end of the season. With that pressing order of business now all but finalised, Chelsea's focus will once again turn to the future of Mount. The 24-year-old is approaching the last 12 months of his contract and has previously rejected the offer of an extension, leading to warnings from Blues officials that he will be sold this summer if he does not change his stance. 90min revealed in April that Chelsea were confident that the imminent arrival of Pochettino would impress Mount and boost their chances of reaching an agreement over fresh terms, and sources have confirmed that their optimism remains. Pochettino is understood to be a huge fan of Mount and has made it abundantly clear to Chelsea that he wants to see a new contract handed to the academy graduate, and the Blues are ready for a fresh round of negotiations in the coming weeks. feed Mount has held positive, informal talks with Chelsea, including co-owner Todd Boehly, in recent weeks, which has boosted the club's hopes that an extension will soon be agreed. Should Mount continue to reject the offers on the table, he will have no shortage of suitors. Liverpool have long been keen on the 24-year-old while 90min can confirm that Arsenal have registered their interest with Mount's representatives. The Gunners are prepared to step up their pursuit of the midfielder in the coming weeks if Mount does decide to leave Chelsea, who are readying another push to try and prevent that from happening. Mount has struggled with injury in recent months and, should he opt to leave Stamford Bridge, may have already played his final game for the club as he battles to return from a minor operation on his pelvis. Interim boss Lampard has already confirmed Mount 'might' miss the final few weeks of the season, and ahead of this weekend's 2-2 draw with Nottingham Forest he confessed it would be a 'tight call' over whether the midfielder will be fit again before the end of the campaign."

Xavi Hernandez has lived up to his president's ambitions in his first full season in charge of the club he captained to such success. However, while the La Liga table looks mightily healthy with a double-digit gap to Real Madrid, the figures on Barcelona's balance sheet are nowhere near as attractive. Naturally, with Laporta at the helm, the goals for the transfer window will be characteristically aspirational. Based on the grounding of 90min's expert transfer assessment, here's a look at how Barcelona could line up for the 2023/24 campaign."

Barcelona's transfer options as fairytale Lionel Messi return nears,"May 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-transfer-options-fairytale-lionel-messi-return-nears,"The 35-year-old has been in Paris for a couple of years trying to fire PSG to glory in the Champions League, but alongside Kylian Mbappe and Neymar, he has failed to match the expectations of the club's board and supporters. A third optional year will not be taken up in Messi's contract, opening the possibility of a dream return to Barcelona, or a potential money-spinning jaunt to Saudi Arabia - a country the World Cup winner has links to already in an ambassadorial capacity. Messi's homecoming would inevitably be the marquee signing for Barcelona as they prepare to build on this season's La Liga title success, but there's other irons in the fire as Xavi bids to return BarÃ§a to Europe's top table. Personal terms have already been agreed with Athletic Club's Inigo Martinez, with the central defender out of contract at the end of the season and able to join on a free transfer, and there's a number of other players being linked with the arrivals lounge at Camp Nou. Here's 90min's spin through of how things stand. The one transfer Barcelona are looking to get over the line above all others is that of Lionel Messi - bringing the all-time great back to the club after a two-year stint at PSG. Whether or not BarÃ§a can afford to do so is another story, but the club are leaving 'no stone unturned' in their bid to make it happen. Saudi Arabian moneybags Al Hilal have their own aspiration of signing Messi - they are hoping a â¬400m-a-year contract and the fact he's an ambassador for the club's tourism board will swing the pendulum in their favour - but all signs point towards a return to Catalonia. Crucially, confidence is growing that Barcelona will be able to facilitate Messi's return in some way and the club hope to announce a deal soon. Ilkay Gundogan represents a real opportunity for Barcelona to add a winner to their ranks, owing to his success at Manchester City. Under Pep Guardiola, Gundogan has got used to winning just about everything, and has one eye on ending the club's wait for a first ever Champions League success. Now 32, he remains one of the first names on the teamsheet, particularly for big games. Gundogan's experience could be a perfect guide for emerging stars Pedri and Gavi, while giving BarÃ§a a great chance to make their own mark on next season's Champions League. In terms of a deal materialising, there's high hopes in Catalonia. Cash flow is still not great at Barcelona but they can't take their eyes off Gundogan's Manchester City team-mate, and creative maestro, Bernardo Silva. The 28-year-old has made noises about wanting to test himself away from the Etihad and there's every chance that BarÃ§a may look to test the soon-to-be (if they keep winning every game) Premier League champions' resolve with a cheeky summer bid. To be successful though, BarÃ§a may need to somehow stump up as much as Â£75m. The third piece of a Manchester City target trio, Barcelona are also looking at a deal for full-back Joao Cancelo, currently on loan at Bayern Munich. The Portuguese has established himself as one of the world's best full-backs in recent years, capable of playing on both flanks and tucking into midfield to provide additional support in central areas. But a rumoured falling out with Pep Guardiola saw Cancelo head for Munich in January, with the Bundesliga giants also having a â¬70m option to buy. That amount is regarded as a little steep, meaning a permanent switch is not guaranteed, and BarÃ§a, along with Arsenal, are monitoring the situation. In the case of the Catalan giants, a loan is the preferred option. Barcelona are pretty well stocked in the forward department but there's been murmurings of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang returning to the club on a free transfer. The Gabonese international left Camp Nou to reunite with former manager Thomas Tuchel at Chelsea, but the German was axed a week after Aubameyang arrived on deadline day last summer. He's barely had a look in since and the Blues are willing to cut ties and get a number of players off their books. By no means a priority signing, Aubameyang could at least offer up another free transfer option for BarÃ§a, and he's certainly interested in returning. There's plenty of buzz in Brazil around teenage sensational Vitor Roque - the latest in a long line of wonderkid forwards destined to make it big in Europe. A far better fit for Barcelona than Aubameyang if long-term plans are factored into the equation, 18-year-old Roque is known to be ready for a move. One stumbling block is Athletico Paranaense having the power to demand â¬60m for the teenager as that's his release clause, and they're likely to hold out for a fee close to that because of significant levels of interest from the Premier League. Barcelona are considered to be at the front of the queue for Roque, who has already played up front for Brazil's senior side, so it's now a question of how far will the club's finances stretch this summer. feed It's been less than three years since Ferran Torres traded Valencia for Manchester City, signing a five-year contract to lead Pep Guardiola's side into the future. The Spaniard didn't manage to showcase what he could do at the Etihad but that didn't stop Barcelona from forking out a wedge of money to lure Torres back to Spain at the end of 2021. Some 15 months later, he could be on the move again. Although highly-rated by Xavi, Barcelona need to raise funds this summer through player sales and reduced wages, making Torres' position at the club vulnerable. He's not first choice and is a long-term target for Mikel Arteta's Arsenal - Aston Villa are also keen after improving under Unai Emery. âThis is a lie and whoever said that is a liar, uninformed and unprofessional,â Raphinha recently said when informed of media reports that he'd agreed to allow Barcelona to listen to offers. But despite the Brazilian's desire to stay at Camp Nou, the decision may be taken out of his hands if Barcelona want to push through a return move for Messi. The two play in the same position and it's unlikely he'll have much sway over a player widely regarded to be the best of all time. Arsenal and Newcastle like Raphinha, as do Chelsea, but it's unclear whether or not he's seen as a preferred target at any of the trio. Ansu Fati was once tipped to be the future of Barcelona, even taking on the club's famous number ten shirt after Lionel Messi's departure. But injuries have hampered the young Spaniard's progress and he has been usurped in Xavi's pecking order by a number of other talented players. Indeed, just 11 of his 31 La Liga appearances so far in 2022/23 have been as a starter. 90min understands that Fati has been told he can move on, but moves to Wolves and West Ham, two interested parties, are unlikely to appeal to a player who once had Manchester United, Arsenal or Chelsea on his coat-tails.  The fourth winger Barcelona are prepared to sanction an exit for, should the terms be right, is Ousmane Dembele - a player they committed to spending â¬144m on when negotiating with Borussia Dortmund. It's fair to say Dembele has struggled to live up to that billing - any player would unless they are regularly competing for Ballon d'Or wins - amid a catalogue of injury problems. Those have cleared up this season, for the most part, allowing Dembele to find some form under Xavi on both wings. The Frenchman's future has been up in the air for years and his latest suitors, Newcastle, could firm up their interest should Champions League qualification be secured. There's talk of Barcelona wanting to give Dembele a new contract - Xavi is a huge fan - but the situation could change in a heartbeat depending on financial need."
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer reveals Man Utd turned down Erling Haaland deal,"May 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ole-gunnar-solskjaer-man-utd-turned-down-erling-haaland-deal,"Solskjaer oversaw Haaland's development during their respective spell at Molde between 2017 and 2018 before the former rejoined Man Utd, firstly as caretaker manager before receiving the job on a permanent basis. Speaking to an audience at the Mercure ManchesterÂ PiccadillyÂ Hotel on Friday evening, Solskjaer revealed that he tried to persuade United to take on the then up-and-coming Haaland when Jose Mourinho was manager. ""I got in contact with United because we had this talented striker who they should have had,"" Solskjaer said. ""But they didn't listen, unfortunately. Four million, I asked for. But they never signed him. Four million! Donât ask [where he is now]. Heâs too good."" feed United did make an attempt to sign Haaland from Red Bull Salzburg in January 2020 when Solskjaer was at the helm, but the striker instead chose to join Borussia Dortmund. He would go on to score a whopping 86 goals in 89 games across two-and-a-half seasons for BVB before completing a Â£51.2m move to Manchester City last summer, following in the footsteps of his father Alf-Inge. Haaland has already broken the record for most Premier League goals scored in a single campaign, finding the net 35 times in his debut campaign. City are also on the cusp of winning the treble. They lead the Premier League by a point from Arsenal but with a game in hand, face Real Madrid in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final on Wednesday and take on Man Utd in the FA Cup final in June."
David Moyes admits Declan Rice likely to leave West Ham this summer,"May 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/david-moyes-declan-rice-likely-to-leave-west-ham-this-summer,"The Scot, who led West Ham to a 2-1 win over AZ Alkmaar in the first leg of their Europa Conference League semi-final clash on Thursday, has always maintained that the club are not looking to sell their best players, despite ongoing speculation about Rice's future. Moyes has even said that interested parties will need to part ways with at least Â£100m to have any chance of luring Rice away from London Stadium - he'll have two years remaining on his contract at the end of the season. 90min has extensively reported on interest in Rice over recent months. Manchester City are among those considering a move this summer, as they plan for life after Ilkay Gundogan and Bernardo Silva, while Arsenal are also a potential landing spot for the England midfielder. Chelsea and Manchester United also hold an interest in Rice, as do Liverpool - they are looking to sign three midfielders this summer but are leaning towards making Brighton's Alexis Mac Allister their first acquisition. feed West Ham could qualify for next season's Europa League if they are able to beat AZ and then Fiorentina or Basel in the Conference League final, but even that achievement is unlikely to match Rice's ambitions. He has previously stated that he wants to play in the Champions League to test himself against the best players in the world. The Hammers have known for a while that cashing in on Rice may be their only option, and Moyes has admitted publicly that his time at the club may be drawing to an end. ""We honestly hope he stays,"" Moyes said. ""We'd love for him to be a West Ham player but we are aware that might not be the case at the end of the season. So that's one of the scenarios around planning. There are plans that we have Dec here but we're also fully aware there is a good chance we won't have him."" He continued: ""The planning has been on the back burner. It's always been about making sure you're a Premier League club. Your planning will go completely if you weren't. A lot of it will only start to go into place once we've realised we have kept our Premier League place. ""We're watching a lot of players, a lot of games, doing a lot of scouting, but truth is the focus has been on staying in the Premier League. We brought in a big number of players last summer so I see this summer more as tinkering and bits and pieces being done here and there. I see a change here or there and an addition or two."" Rice was outstanding in West Ham's most recent Premier League win - a 1-0 success over Manchester United - and those three points look to have secured the club's place in the top flight barring a dramatic late turn of events."
'Quality players want to come' - Erik ten Hag drops huge Man Utd transfer hint,"May 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/erik-ten-hag-drops-huge-man-utd-transfer-hint,"The Red Devils have largely enjoyed a successful first year under the Dutchman, notably ending their six-year wait for a trophy by winning the Carabao Cup. Though qualification back to the Champions League looked safe a month ago, a poor run of results means that United could yet be dragged back into a battle for a top-four spot. Nevertheless, Ten Hag is adamant that the club's summer transfer business will not hinge on which European competition they are in next season and claimed that they can now sign better players than before. feed ""I see a big difference in comparison with last year,"" he said at a press conference on Friday. ""There were a lot of reservations last year when I spoke with players and now many players see the project, what's going on, the dynamic and the ambition in this project, the quality especially. ""They are really keen to come, I've noticed that. It looks like there were a lot of reservations last year, a lot of doubts when we approached players. This year, many quality players really want to come."" Man Utd made five key additions to their squad during Ten Hag's first transfer window, bring in Lisandro Martinez, Christian Eriksen, Casemiro, Tyrell Malacia and Antony. They then added Wout Weghorst, Jack Butland and Marcel Sabitzer on loan in January. Man Utd are gearing up for a busy summer in the transfer market. While David de Gea is closing in on a new contract, 90min understands they have been keeping watchful eyes over Porto's Diogo Costa and Brentford's David Raya this season, while young goalkeeper Matej Kovar could challenge him for the starting spot too. The Red Devils have also kept tabs on Milan defender Fikayo Tomori, as well as Monaco's Axel Disasi. Further up the pitch, Man Utd have considered bolstering their midfield options, with Bayern Munich's Ryan Gravenberch and Chelsea's Mateo Kovacic among their targets. Signing a new striker is among Man Utd's top priorities, with Tottenham's Harry Kane and Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic among a raft players on their shortlist."

However, he was persuaded to stay and fight for his place by the incoming Mikel Arteta. Since then, Xhaka has embarked on a redemption arc that could yet end in Premier League glory, establishing himself as a dependable figure in the heart of midfield during the Gunners' title challenge this season. Arsenal remain a point behind Manchester City in the standings, though the reigning champions also have a game in hand."
Jurgen Klopp reveals what lack of Champions League football would mean for Liverpool transfer plans,"May 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jurgen-klopp-champions-league-football-liverpool-transfer-plans,"The Reds currently sit in fifth place in the Premier League, just one point adrift of Manchester United having playing a game more than their arch rivals.  A few months ago Liverpool had seemingly no hope of qualifying for Europe's elite competition having started the 2022/23 season surprisingly poorly. Results have picked recently, however, with Liverpool winning their last five Premier League games on the bounce - results which have pushed them into top four contention.  Regardless of whether or not Liverpool catch fourth place United, Klopp has insisted in his latest pre-match press conference that the club's transfer plans will not be affected. âAt the moment, when you talk [to a player], you realise that heâs already clarified because we canât tell anybody that we will be definitely in Champions League next year,' the German said. feed âSo if heâs talking to us then itâs probably already clear that he knows about that situation. Itâs obvious that we have to fight for being part of the Champions League and to fight for trophies. And if you want to be part of that, youâre more than welcome. Itâs only one thing which we canât guarantee this year and this is Champions League football. âAll the rest is the same like it was before. Itâs a fantastic club with a really, really good football team and an even better one hopefully next year. So thatâs it, and thatâs not so difficult. Iâve barely faced the situation that you are in talks with the player and everything sounds great in the end, he says âok, now, see you if that happensâ. âWeâre still Liverpool and that means we are really attractive for a lot of players and we should not forget that. Thatâs why Iâm not concerned about that fact. âEverything is more difficult without Champions League, thatâs how it is. Especially in the long term; we should not do these kind of things more often. Apart from that, itâs absolutely ok the situation we are in, from a talking point of view and from a convincing point of view.â Liverpool have recently been linked with a number of players ahead of the summer transfer window, with 90min reporting that the club are keen to get a deal for Alexis Mac Allister over the line by the end of May.

Barcelona confident of announcing Lionel Messi return soon,"May 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-confident-of-announcing-lionel-messi-return-soon,"The 35-year-old is at the centre of a tug of war between former employers Barca and Saudi Arabian outfit Al Hilal, with his two-year stay at Paris Saint-Germain guaranteed to come to an end this summer. Al Hilal are confident they can persuade Messi to move to Saudi Arabia - he recently made an unauthorised trip to the country as part of his duties as an ambassador for the tourism board - but the player is believed to prefer a return to Catalonia, where he spent the first 21 years of his career after moving from his native Argentina. Messi's representatives, including his father, Jorge, have received a contract offer from Al Hilal estimated to be worth â¬400m-a-year, which would make him the highest paid footballer of all time. Barcelona won't be able to match that financial package but are doing all they can to clear the financial decks and make space for Messi on their wage bill - he only left the club in 2021 because La Liga would not authorise his new contract due to the club's financial plight. President Joan Laporta is confident the club will be able to balance the numbers and sources have reiterated to 90min that Barcelona believe they will be in a position to announce Messi's return soon. manual One piece of the jigsaw was slotted into place earlier this week when veteran midfielder Sergio Busquets confirmed he will depart Camp Nou at the end of the season, after winning 32 major honours with his boyhood club en route to making over 700 appearances. Busquets was one of Barcelona's highest earners, with his imminent departure prompting La Liga  president, Javier Tebas, to tell COPE of Messi's potential return: âBusquetsâs departure is the beginning of the road for Messi to return. âBut to reach the end, they still have to walk many meters. Iâm not the one to give them the green light, it will be their economic control.â 90min understands that Barcelona are prepared to listen to offers for young winger Ansu Fati, while they will also consider bids for Ousmane Dembele, Raphinha and Ferran Torres - players who all earn a significant wage at the club and may see their minutes marginalised by Messi's return. Others are likely to leave as well to allow Barcelona to pursue other long-term targets, including Manchester City duo Ilkay Gundogan, who is available this summer on a free transfer, and Bernardo Silva."
Jude Bellingham agrees personal terms with Real Madrid,"May 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jude-bellingham-agrees-personal-terms-with-real-madrid,"Bellingham is one of the most wanted players in world football at present and has been courted by the likes of Manchester City and Liverpool for a number of months, as well as Los Blancos, with all parties anticipating a potential move for the England international in 2023. The 19-year-old's representatives have spoken to each of the main contenders while Dortmund themselves had their own pitch for Bellingham to extend his contract with the club before moving at a later date. However, Bellingham informed Real of his decision to join them at the start of May via Juni Calafat, the club's chief scout and driving force behind the signings of Fede Valverde, Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo Goes. Dortmund were later informed by Bellingham's representatives that he would not be extending his deal with them, and that the player instead wanted to push through the transfer to Spain. City were also told of Bellingham's choice - with no bad blood between the parties, Bellingham's decision has been taken as a matter of preference and career mapping. manual Bellingham's team have been in talks with Real over the last week to finalise terms and they are now agreed, with the initial deal set to run for six years. A release clause of â¬1bn has also been set for when the contract is signed. With the player's wishes now clear, the onus is on Madrid to reach a deal with Dortmund. They are set to speak this month to reach an agreement that suits all parties, though Dortmund have maintained throughout the process that they are looking to reach a deal worth a total value of â¬150m - a club record sale that would surpass the sum Barcelona paid for Ousmane Dembele in 2017. There is no release clause set in Bellingham's current contract, meaning the structure of the transfer is open to negotiation for both clubs. Initial talks, 90min has learned, have been centred around payment structure and how much will be paid up front. Real are aware of the size of the deal required and are prepared to be flexible in order to get it over the line - with the teams not far aware from finalising."

United are in the market for other goalkeepers and have been assessing their options, including the likes of Swiss veteran Yann Sommer, who is expected to leave Bayern Munich this summer, and Anderlecht's young Dutch keeper Bart Verbruggen. They have also looked at Porto's Diogo Costa and Brentford's David Raya, but with De Gea's extension in the offing it remains to be seen if they will spend big on a new goalkeeper. That's where Matej Kovar comes into the equation. feed Sources have told 90min the 22-year-old is under consideration for a place in the first-team next season after emerging as one of the best young keepers in Europe. Kovar has been with United since 2018 after joining from FC Slovacko. He has never played for United's first team but was involved in the Champions League squad under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He has tasted first-team football during loan stints at Swindon, Burton and now Sparta Prague. Kovar has enjoyed a brilliant campaign in his homeland with Sparta, who are top of the Czech First League table and hoping to claim a first title in nine years. 90min understands United have been keeping close tabs on Kovar, particularly in recent months, and the reports on his progress have been glowing. It is now believed United's goalkeeping staff think Kovar can push to become De Gea's understudy at Old Trafford.

He progressed through the various age groups and has been a first-team regular since 2020. Zubimendi has consistently played Europa League football in recent years and has earned plaudits for his role helping La Real challenge for a top four finish this season to return to the Champions League for the first time in almost a decade â they have a seven-point cushion on fifth place Villarreal with only five games left to play. With Busquetsâ impending exit from Camp Nou suspected for some time but finally confirmed this week, reports in Spain have already picked out Zubimendi as a like for like replacement. But the 24-year-old, whose contract at Anoeta runs until 2027, doesnât appear keen. âI have never said anything about wanting to leave La Real,â he told Radio Marca Donostia. âI do nothing but see news of that and it makes me feel uneasy. I have neither listened nor wanted to do anything. I do not know if I have been able to leave, but I have not even considered it. I have already said it several times, to say it more times it seems that they do not listen to me.â feed Barcelonaâs main transfer ambition for the summer is re-sign Lionel Messi, who is set to leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of his contract next month. Sources have previously confirmed to 90min that the club is âleaving no stone unturnedâ in their efforts to strike a deal that will comply with La Liga financial regulations. In that regard, La Liga president Javier Tebas has already warned that Barcelona must âtake many financial measuresâ. Tebas said last month: âToday, I don't see his signing as feasible. But thereâs a lot of time left, Barca can still make moves to get Leo. We are still awaiting a feasibility plan from Barcelona. They need a big effort to make it happen.â Barcelona have been confident for some time, although there is rival interest from Saudi Arabia, for whom Messi is a tourism ambassador, and confidence from club Al Hilal that a deal will be struck. In addition to Messi, the Catalans are keen on Manchester City captain Ilkay Gundogan and remain confident the German will join on a free transfer when his contract in England soon expires. Another Manchester City player that Barcelona have had longstanding interest in is Bernardo Silva. That interest is reciprocated but, as 90min has reported, City will only sell if an offer meets what they deem to be the Portugal internationalâs market value - Â£75m (â¬86m). Aymeric Laporte is a third City player on the radar in the Camp Nou offices but, again, finances are proving to be a hurdle, while they would enter the race to sign out of favour full-back Joao Cancelo if a transfer could be arranged as an initial loan. Up front, Barcelona are targeting 18-year-old Athletico Paranaense prodigy Vitor Roque. However, the finances are set to be an issue and there could be rival interest from Arsenal and Chelsea, able to offer a more attractive permanent transfer rather than an initial loan. Brightonâs Evan Ferguson and Celta Vigoâs Gabri Veiga are other young talents being watched."
Manuel Ugarteâs agent claims move is imminent amid Liverpool links,"May 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/manuel-ugarte-agent-claims-move-imminent-amid-liverpool-links,"The Uruguay international has enjoyed a stellar couple of seasons in the Portuguese capital following his 2021 move from Famalicao, notably playing a starring role in Sporting's triumphs against north London rivals Arsenal and Tottenham in European competition this term, and his performances have not gone unnoticed. 90min understands that a number of Premier League sides have shown an appreciation of Ugarte, including Liverpool, who have him on their shortlist of midfielders and are one of the clubs most keen on a deal. Aston Villa are also fond of Ugarte, while Newcastle, West Ham and Wolves have watched him in recent times. But despite there being a widespread liking for Ugarte and his abilities, sources have told 90min that interested parties value him at around Â£30m - a figure roughly Â£20m short of his current release clause.

Arsenal have also sent scouts to watch Ugarte in previous months but they have cooled their interest and are focusing on other targets."
Pep Guardiola passionately appeals for Lionel Messi's 'impossible' Barcelona return,"May 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/pep-guardiola-passionately-appeals-lionel-messi-impossible-barcelona-return,"Messi's career as we know it took off under Guardiola at Camp Nou, becoming a perennial Ballon d'Or winner and announcing himself as one of the best players of all time even early in his career.

"Arsenal, Bayern Munich & Barcelona interested in Joao Cancelo signing","May 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/arsenal-bayern-munich-barcelona-interested-joao-cancelo-signing,"The Portugal international was surprisingly sent on loan to Bayern Munich for the second half of the 2022/23 season, and City fans booed Cancelo when he came on as a substitute during Bayern's Champions League quarter-final defeat at the Etihad Stadium in April. 28-year-old Cancelo initially struggled to nail down a place under Julian Nagelsmann but has since become more of a regular with Thomas Tuchel at the helm. Bayern retain a â¬70m option to buy Cancelo once his loan expires this summer but they have publicly insisted this price is too steep. 90min understands that the German champions would like to keep hold of the versatile full-back, however. In addition to Bayern, other major clubs across the continent are interested in Cancelo. Barcelona have been monitoring his situation and it's understood they would enter the race for his signature if they could sign him on an initial loan first. feed Arsenal are also keen on Cancelo. Mikel Arteta briefly worked with him during their respective times at Manchester City and the Spaniard believes that he could slot nicely into the Gunners' current tactical setup. Real Madrid are also in the market for a right-back with their options thin beyond the veteran Dani Carvajal, and Cancelo's camp have been exploring the Santiago Bernabeu as a possible landing spot. Cancelo arrived at City in 2019 on a long-term contract, joining from Juventus in a deal that sent Danilo the other way. He became the most expensive right-back in history in the process, but initially struggled to dislodge Kyle Walker from the side and played a bit-part role. He showed his versatility to eventually command a regular spot at left-back, shuffling between the two positions as helped City win back-to-back Premier League titles in 2020/21 and 2021/22."

They have invested heavily and recently saw the team return to the EFL for the first time in 15 years by winning the National League title. The club reaped the rewards of tempting goalkeeper Ben Foster out of retirement in the closing stages of the campaign and there are already big plans for the 2023/24 season ahead in League Two. McElhenney, who found fame in the long-running cult TV show Itâs Always Sunny in Philadelphia, first propositioned Bale on Twitter: âHey Gareth Bale, letâs play golf, where I totally wonât spend four hours trying to convince you to un-retire for one last magical season.â Bale later joked, âI think I was looking more for a free round of golf off Rob.â The Wrexham pair later denied it was a joke on their part, with McElhenney going on to tell Welsh broadcaster S4C: âI think thereâs seriousness from our side, but I donât know that thereâs seriousness from his. I think heâs happy.â manual But Reynolds appeared to hint there was still hope when he said: âI like that we can kind of do some stuff thatâs a little outside the box of convention when it comes to goofing around. I didnât think Ben Foster would be coming over and he did.â McElhenney also seems to be refusing to take no for an answer, calling on Bale just this week during an appearance on The Aarthi and Sriram Show to give it âone last yearâ. Speaking to Sky Sports, Baleâs long-standing agent, Jonathan Barnett, has now quashed the idea that the 33-year-old former Real Madrid star has any desire to be back on a football pitch. âHeâs flattered by the offers, but theyâre all tongue-in-cheek,â Barnett said. âHeâs having a great life at the moment and [itâs] well deserved â heâs been the best British football, probably ever. Heâs now having a well-deserved rest and weâll see how things go. âThey havenât actually spoken to me, theyâve only spoken to Gareth. But Gareth doesnât want to play football anymore. Heâs had a great career, enjoyed himself, but heâs having a great life with his family, which is the most important thing, and spending a lot of time with his children and thatâs what he wants to do. Heâll do other things later down the line, but at the moment, let him just enjoy himself. âWeâd been discussing [retirement] for a long time. For him, it was the right time. Heâs achieved everything he wanted to. He played for Wales at the highest level in a World Cup, which is what he really wanted to do, and I think he knew his body wasnât up to it anymore. Heâd had a hard time with his body in the last few years and now heâs a different person.â Having left Real Madrid in 2022 and spending the end of that year helping LAFC win the MLS Cup for the first time and going to the World Cup with Wales, Bale hung his boots in January 2023."
Is Jude Bellingham joining Real Madrid?,"May 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/is-jude-bellingham-joining-real-madrid,"A whole host of clubs were said to be interested in acquiring the England international at the end of the 2022/23 season, but Borussia Dortmund's hefty price tag forced several clubs, including Liverpool, out of the running. Instead of putting all of their eggs in the Bellingham basket, the Reds are now primed to take a more Moneyball-esque approach to rebuilding and reshaping their midfield. Real Madrid and Man City, however, are two clubs that seemingly haven't been deterred by the midfielder's price tag and it's the Spanish giants who have taken considerable strides to securing the signing of the youngster. Real Madrid are leading the race to sign Bellingham, with many believing the current European champions are the midfielder's preferred destination this summer.  90min reported that the meeting between Bellingham's father and Real Madrid chief scout Juni Calafat was hugely positive and the player is close to reaching a deal with the Spanish behemoths. Real, however, are yet to strike a deal with the German club. While it's unclear how much it'll cost to convince Dortmund to sell, it's almost certain that Bellingham will garner a fee close to â¬150m (Â£130.4m). Negotiations are said to be in their final stages and the impending contract extensions of Toni Kroos and Luka Modric will not have any impact on the potential deal. Real regard Bellingham as their present and future.  Err...absolutely! While Dortmund are fully aware that it'll be hard to keep the teenager on their books for next season, they are giving it a go - hence why they're demanding a club-record fee for his sale this summer.  Bellingham's current deal expires in 2025, but Dortmund are willing to offer him a bumper new deal in a bid to convince him to stay. Reports suggest BVB have offered the midfielder a fresh salary of â¬14m, but that offer pales in comparison to Real's supposed â¬20m offering.  After dazzling for three seasons in the Bundesliga, the time now seems right for Bellingham to move on. City are certainly still in the hunt, but they've got to move right now if they're to have any chance of snatching Bellingham away from Real Madrid. The back-to-back Premier League champions hold an interest in the midfielder, but they're yet to send any sort of offer to Dortmund or Bellingham.  Some thought the England international would be an excellent replacement for Ilkay Gundogan, whose contract expires in the summer, but his recent form will surely convince the club to negotiate a new deal. manual Liverpool's midfield is in dire need of a refresh and Bellingham appeared to be the ultimate solution to the Reds' woes.  The Merseyside club certainly boasted an interest in the box-to-box midfielder before pulling out of the race in April. Bellingham long appeared to be the answer to their problems, with club legends like Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher doing their bit in the media to get the England international to Anfield. However, the club simply cannot commit such a significant amount of resources to signing one player when such a major rebuild of the squad is required to help Liverpool return to their apex. Instead, the Reds will rebuild their midfield with a couple of additions. They also possess an interest in Chelsea's Mason Mount, Brighton's Alexis Mac Allister and Inter's Nicolo Barella."
Raphinha hits out at reports of Barcelona exit,"May 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/raphinha-hits-out-at-reports-of-barcelona-exit,"Raphinha joined Barcelona from Leeds last summer in a deal worth up to Â£55m. The Brazilian had a mixed start to the season, finding himself in and out of the starting XI and struggling for goals and assists. But he has hit his stride since 2022 became 2023, managing nine direct goal contributions in his last 16 La Liga games, compared to only four in his first 15. However, Barcelonaâs ongoing financial trouble will make player sales necessary again to raise capital ahead of next season, especially with ambitions to re-sign Lionel Messi. In that regard, Ansu Fati has already been told he can leave, as reported by 90min. There is likely to be no shortage of interest in Raphinha. Arsenal wanted the 26-year-old last summer when he was in the process of leaving Leeds and even made contact with Barcelona over both him and Ferran Torres in January after missing out to Chelsea on Mykhailo Mudryk. The interest from north London in both players still stands, with 90min reporting only last week that Arsenal remain determined to sign a right winger as part of a targeted wider recruitment drive ahead of returning to the Champions League next season for the first time in six years. feed Raphinha and Torres each feature on a list of Gunners targets, as does Bayer Leverkusenâs Moussa Diaby. Soon to be free agent Wilfried Zaha is also a secondary option at this stage. But Raphinha has responded angrily to a post by Fanaticos Por Futebol on Instagram that claimed he has said âOKâ to Barcelona listening to offers. The post specifically referenced Chelsea and Newcastle and appeared to have twisted a report originally published by SPORT. âThis is a lie and whoever said that is a liar, uninformed and unprofessional,â he directly replied. Raphinhaâs determination to stay at Barcelona is understandable. As 90min reported last July, he was holding out for a transfer to Camp Nou at a time when Chelsea had already agreed a fee with Leeds. The Blues were tellingly unable to agree personal terms, given that the player and agent, Deco, the former Porto, Barcelona and Chelsea star, were both angling for a switch to Catalonia instead."

And 90min understands Leao has now agreed a new five-year contract at San Siro, with the player's representatives informing interested parties of the decision. Chelsea had long courted Leao and have spent lavishly in the Todd Boehly era, while Manchester City had been keeping a watchful eye on his contract negotiations with Milan. There had been an ongoing legal case between previous clubs Lille and Sporting CP over an unpaid transfer bill from the former to the latter, but this has since been sorted. feed Milan have not removed Leao's â¬150m release clause from this new contract. Leao has announced himself as one of the world's premier forwards in recent years, firing Milan to their first Scudetto in over a decade last season. He won Serie A's MVP award for his stellar performances. Though Milan have fallen short in their Serie A title defence this term, Leao has been the shining light in their run to the Champions League semi-finals. His crowning moment came in their quarter-final second leg at Napoli, teeing up Olivier Giroud's tie-clinching goal with an enthralling solo run."
Oliver Kahn reveals how close Bayern Munich came to signing Erling Haaland,"May 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/oliver-kahn-how-close-bayern-munich-came-to-signing-erling-haaland,"FC Hollywood were one of a number of clubs who held talks with the superstar striker while he was on the books at Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund - where he scored a quite ridiculous 86 goals in 89 games in all competitions in two-and-a-half seasons.  Haaland would eventually sign for Manchester City for a fee of around Â£55m, with Bayern opting to sign Sadio Mane as their replacement for Robert Lewandowski. While Mane has struggled for form in Bavaria, Haaland has thrived in Lancashire, breaking the all-time single Premier League season goalscoring record. The 22-year-old has 35 strikes to his name and also scored crucial goals to knock Bayern out of the Champions League at the quarter-final stage. Speaking about Haaland to BILD Sport, CEO Kahn has now revealed the lengths Bayern went to in order to try and push through a move before coming up short. ""We tried everything for Erling Haaland one year ago and went to our financial limits,"" the former goalkeeper said. ""We had to decide: do we want to break our wage structure? We werenât ready for that. Thatâs not Bayern-like."" feed In light of Haaland's move to Manchester and Mane's indifferent form in Munich, 90min understands that Bayern are already prepared to listen to offers for the latter - the Senegalese international has played second fiddle to Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting in recent weeks - and are pursuing a move for Eintracht Frankfurt's Randal Kolo Muani. Talks have been held with the Frenchman's representatives about a potential move to Bayern, though Frankfurt's CEO Axel Hallmann recently suggested that a bid of at least â¬90m would be needed for a deal to be agreed. âKolo Muani? When I look at the international market, I imagine a different number than â¬90m - more than this,"" he said. ""He has a long-term deal. My absolutely ideal scenario would be that he stays with Eintracht.""

Busquets has racked up 719 appearances for Barcelona, a tally that is only bettered by former teammates Lionel Messi and Xavi. Should BarÃ§a win La Liga, he will have won a staggering 32 major honours for his boyhood club.

Brighton ready to consider Moises Caicedo offers,"May 10, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/brighton-to-consider-moises-caicedo-offers,"The Seagulls have little intention of becoming a selling club in the long-term, but they are also an analytically driven club and every player has their price.

However, 90min has been told that if the bidding for the in-demand Caicedo surpasses a certain number - believed to be Â£80m - then Brighton are ready to have conversations about his future. Brighton rejected all offers for the midfielder in January, with both Chelsea and Arsenal pushing hard and seeing bids of up to Â£70m knocked back. Caicedo made it known in January that he wanted to leave, but within weeks of the window closing he penned a new long-term contract, tying him to the club until 2027 with an option for a further year. feed Despite this new deal, interest in Caicedo has not dissipated and Arsenal are still very interested in taking him to north London. West Hamâs Declan Rice is a player the Gunners like a lot, but 90min understands that Caicedo remains an option as well. Liverpool and Manchester United are also confirmed admirers of Caicedo and retain an interest, while it is believed Manchester City have him on a list of potential backups to top target Jude Bellingham, who is likely to join Real Madrid instead this summer. Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi, who is becoming more involved with the club's transfer decisions, is eager to keep his key men, but potentially bringing in Â£150m for Mac Allister and Caicedo - who cost the club Â£11m combined - would be a staggering bit of business for any club. Should those deals be sanctioned, Brighton have made it clear they will reinvest in the squad. They have already agreed summer deals for Watford's Joao Pedro for a club-record Â£30m, as well as James Milner on a free transfer from Liverpool."

Liverpool's need to retool - particularly in midfield - has become a lot more evident this campaign, and 90min understands they remain huge fans of Tchouameni. feed Liverpool have informed Real Madrid they would be willing to take the 23-year-old off their hands should he become available. Jude Bellingham is expected to head to the Santiago Bernabeu this summer, while Toni Kroos and Luka Modric are likely to pen new deals, making competition for midfield places fierce. Tchouameni has endured a steady but hardly eye-catching debut season in Spain, though has not always been called upon in big games - most recently, he was dropped from the starting lineup to face Manchester City in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final. However, Carlo Ancelotti and the Real Madrid hierarchy do not intend to let the France international leave and the player himself has not displayed any signs of discontent. Nevertheless, even if Tchouameni is not available for a permanent transfer, Liverpool would still be interested in taking him on loan. Other midfielders on Liverpool's radar include Mason Mount, James Maddison, Florian Neuhaus, Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister. Bellingham had been their top target before pulling out of the race to sign him in April."

"Premier League clubs scout Lens stars Kevin Danso, Seko Fofana & Lois Openda","May 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/premier-league-clubs-scout-lens-stars-kevin-danso-seko-fofana-lois-openda,"Lens have been one of the surprise packages in Ligue 1 this season and currently sit in second place in the table, leapfrogging Marseille with their 2-1 victory at the Stade Bollaert-Delelis.  Key to Lens' astonishing 2022/23 season has been the form of their best players, Danso, Fofana and Openda. That is form which, as expected, has caught the eye of a number of Premier League clubs. 90min understands that Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool, Newcastle, Aston Villa, Wolves and West Ham all sent scouts to the game to watch Lens' three star men.   feed Centre-back Danso, who spent a short time on loan at Southampton during the 2019/20 season, attracted particular interest from Manchester United, Liverpool, Newcastle, Aston Villa and Wolves scouts during the game, with the Austrian bagging an assist to boot.  Throughout the 2022/23 campaign, Danso has been the main man in a defence which has conceded a Ligue 1 low of just 26 goals in 34 games.   Both Manchester United and Liverpool are in the market for some defensive reinforcements this summer, with 90min recently reporting that the two clubs sent scouts to watch Ajax's Jurrien Timber. As well as a centre-back, Liverpool are also notably keen to sign central midfielders during the upcoming transfer window. As such, 90min understands that Reds scouts were also keeping a close eye on the performance of Seko Fofana during the Lens - Marseille game. The midfielder is the club captain and signed a new deal at the Ligue 1 outfit last year, but Liverpool as well as Newcastle and West Ham hold a long-standing interest in the player.  Fofana is on the lengthy list of midfielders Liverpool has kept an eye on in recent months. 90min recently reported that Ibrahim Sangare and Teun Koopmeiners are also among the options, and the club are also keen to finalise a move for Alexis Mac Allister this month.   Sources have confirmed to 90min that Lois Openda is of interest to Arsenal, who have the in-form striker on a list of potential number nine options ahead of the summer.  The 23-year-old has been one of the most in-form strikers in Europe recently, scoring 10 goals in his last eight appearances for Lens - including the winner at the weekend against Marseille.  Along with Openda, Arsenal also retain an interest in Dusan Vlahovic, who is keen to move to the Premier League after a different first full season at Juventus. "
Lionel Messi's father releases statement regarding Saudi Arabia transfer reports,"May 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/lionel-messi-father-statement-regarding-saudi-arabia-transfer-reports,"Reports in France have claimed that Messi has already accepted terms to sign for a team in the Saudi Pro League upon the expiration of his PSG contract this summer. 90min understands that while Al Hilal are confident of securing Messi's signature, former club Barcelona feel the same way, though nothing is close to being finalised yet. And Jorge Messi has released a statement insisting that his son has indeed not decided upon his future yet, lashing out at reporting which states that he has. feed ""There is absolutely nothing with any club for next year. The decision will never be made before Lionel ends the league with PSG,"" he said. ""Once the season is over it will be time to analyse and see what is there, and then make a decision. ""There are always rumours and many use the name of Lionel to gain notoriety but the truth is only one and we can assure that there is nothing with anyone. Neither verbal, nor signed, nor agreed, and there will not be until the end of the season. ""It seems to me a lack of respect, that there are those who consciously and deliberately deceive, without providing proof of any of their claims, and wanting to turn any malicious rumour into news or that is directed by someone in favour of their interests. They would have to explain that they do not contrast the information...they will not want a truth to ruin their 'news'."""
Al Hilal confident of Lionel Messi deal but talks continue with Barcelona,"May 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/al-hilal-confident-lionel-messi-deal-talks-continue-barcelona,"The 35-year-old is due to leave Paris Saint-Germain this summer on a free transfer after deciding against staying in the French capital. Messi is keen to move back to Barcelona, who are working hard in the background to make a deal financially viable, but Al Hilal have made him a huge offer should he not return to Spain. The Argentine is already an official ambassador for Saudi Arabia's tourism authority, and was recently suspended by PSG for making an unsanctioned visit to the country in the aftermath of the 3-1 defeat to Lorient. Messi's representatives have been speaking with Al Hilal officials in recent weeks and they have made him an offer which is understood to be worth more than â¬400m-a-year - which would make him the highest paid footballer of all time, surpassing the â¬220m-a-year that Cristiano Ronaldo is earning at Al Nassr. feed Sources have told 90min that while Al Hilal believe they are well placed to land Messi, talks are continuing with Barcelona, who are doing everything they can to take him back to Catalonia. La Liga need to authorise any new Barcelona contracts due to their financial situation and Joan Laporta is confident that their feasibility plans, which include their offer for Messi, will be approved this week. Messi, who is likely to wait until the end of the 2022/23 season before finalising his next move, was named Sportsman of the Year at the Laureus World Sport Awards on Monday."
Why Willian rejected Liverpool & Tottenham to join Chelsea,"May 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/why-willian-rejected-liverpool-tottenham-to-join-chelsea,"At 34, Willian is enjoying a career resurgence with Fulham, having seen an earlier spell at Arsenal not work out as hoped and then returned to Brazil to join Corinthians. But the veteran winger, who has made his permanent home in London, could have easily had a very different career had he been prepared to join Liverpool a decade ago instead. Willian first arrived in Europe as a teenager when he was scouted by Shakhtar Donetsk way back in 2007. He played more than 220 games for the club and won 10 domestic and European trophies. But interest from Chelsea in particular surfaced as early as 2011 and Shakhtar blocked a transfer. The Sao Paulo native wound up joining short-lived Russian powerhouse Anzhi Makachkala alongside Samuel Etoâo, before that experiment blew up and he was made available for sale. âI went to London,â Willian told PL Brasil. âLiverpool and Tottenham showed interest.Â I was negotiating with both [but] not Chelsea.Â And in my heart the dream was to go to Chelsea. ""Proposals came from both [Liverpool and Tottenham] and, as I wanted to stay in London, I decided that I would go to Tottenham.Â It was alright, I had already done medical tests, all that was left was to go to Tottenham's training ground to sign the contract.â feed Willian admitted that he was going to sign for Tottenham still âwith Chelsea in mindâ. So when an offer from Stamford Bridge finally came through at the 11th hour, he backed out of the Spurs deal. âChelsea made an offer and I didn't think twice,â he recalled.Â âIt was something I really wanted, with all due respect to Tottenham, which is also a great club, but my dream was to play for Chelsea. âWhen I was at Shakhtar, the first club that made an offer for me was Chelseaâ¦in 2011. I started to follow the club, I saw [Didier] Drogba, [John] Terry, went crazy for the Blues and decided that wanted to play for Chelsea.Â It became a dream.â Willian explained that Shakhtar rejected three separate Chelsea offers, even hinting the Ukrainian club reneged on a promise to let him go for a certain amount. He later went on to score twice for Shakhtar at Stamford Bridge in a Champions League game, but Chelsea had âgiven upâ by the time he was determined to leave Donetsk for a new challenge, with only Anzhi prepared to meet a â¬35m release clause. âI thought the club's project was cool,â he said. âI played with Eto'o,Â we were runners-up in the Russian Cup.Â But in the middle of [2013] the owner of the team had a health problem, decided that he would stop investing and sell the players.Â And then my negotiations with English clubs began.â"
Steve McManaman admits Real Madrid's 'aura' key to expected Jude Bellingham move,"May 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/steve-mcmanaman-real-madrid-aura-key-jude-bellingham-move,"19-year-old Bellingham has been heavily linked with Real, City and Liverpool all season long, but 90min revealed last week that a move to the Santiago Bernabeu this summer now looks likely after a positive round of talks with the teenager's father. McManaman spent four years playing for Real Madrid between 1999 and 2003, scoring in the 3-0 win over Valencia in the 2000 Champions League final before winning the competition again two years later, so knows exactly what it's like to play for a club regarded by many to be the biggest in the world.  Speaking exclusively to 90min, McManaman, who also won two La Liga titles and a UEFA Super Cup during his Bernabeu stint, opened up about why Bellingham may opt to join Real instead of one of his Premier League suitors, stating that the ""all-round package"" is hard for any player to resist. ""They have an aura, they have a history, they have the stadium, they have the city, they have the fans who adore the players if you're successful, and I think the all-round package is that,"" McManaman said. ""There's a reason why so many ex-players decide to stay in Madrid [after they retire]. You've got players like Zinedine Zidane, Luis Figo, Santiago Solari, Roberto Carlos, all who are not from Spain yet every one of them resides in Madrid. And they reside in Madrid for a reason, and that reason is that it's a wonderful city and they have a great quality of life. So I think little things like this, not just the football, helps attract people.  Why would Jude Bellingham choose Real Madrid over any other club? ð§Former Madrid player Steve McManaman lists all of the incredible reasons why...@btsportfootball | @btsport pic.twitter.com/9Qh5iqdBNe ""Their stadium is going to be incredible [when completed] next year, and their history of winning things is etched on their shirts. They're always successful every single year.  ""The fact that they can offer him the all-round package and be treated like a hero, like a god, I think that might be the culmination for him."" McManaman also revealed how Bellingham could fit into Real Madrid's side, citing Los Blancos' need to rejuvenate their squad as being a key reason for why the move is being made. ""If he does come in he'll bring a drive to Madrid that I don't think Tchouameni and Camavinga do. They don't play the same way as Jude does. Toni Kroos has still got a number of years left and I know Luka [Modric] is going to be 38 in September.  ""I just think he offers them something else. He offers something different to Tchouameni and Camavinga, and I think Fede Valverde will complement him and work as a runner and a real good ball player. He could have Rodrygo and Vinicius, both young players too, either side of him further forward  and Benzema will get a new contract, of course he will, and Real Madrid are in the market for a new centre forward too. feed ""So I think they're just trying to refresh the squad. They've still got their bit-part players on the bench, and I think they'll keep a lot of them but they'll also move a few on. Financially it won't be a big burden on Madrid because they've still got money to spend. ""It's another really good signing if Jude does go to Madrid."" 90min understands that Modric is set to join Kroos and Benzema in signing a one-year extension at Real, even though his minutes may be reduced by Bellingham's potential arrival."
Napoli set asking price for Man Utd target Kim Min-jae despite reluctance to sell,"May 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/napoli-set-asking-price-man-utd-target-kim-min-jae,"The South Korea international has announced himself as one of the world's leading centre-backs since his move to Serie A from Fenerbahce last summer, and is known to be of interest to Manchester United, Liverpool and a number of other leading clubs. The 26-year-old has played a key role in helping Napoli win their first Scudetto since 1990, and the Partenopei have spent much of the year trying to tie Kim and winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia down to new and improved deals, believing that striker Victor Osimhen would be the only high-profile departure in the summer. While a contract extension is not off the table and they are reluctant to part ways, sources have told 90min that Napoli would find it hard to knock back bids for Kim in excess of â¬60m amid increasing interest. feed Kim's current deal contains a release clause worth around â¬45m which sources believe is active for the first two weeks of the summer transfer window, but an up-front payment of that amount is difficult for any side to action because of Financial Fair Play regulations. 90min understands that Manchester United are in the market for a right-footed centre-back and had representatives at Napoli's 1-0 win over Fiorentina at the weekend. Ajax's Jurrien Timber and Benfica's Antonio Silva are also on their radar. Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham were also at the Stadio Diego Maradona on Sunday and are long-term admirers of Kim - Spurs notably made a play for him when he was at Beijing Guoan in 2020. Paris Saint-Germain have kept eyes on Kim too, though with Milan Skriniar arriving on a free transfer from Inter this summer, another centre-back is not seen as a priority for them right now."
Football transfer rumours: Messi's decision deadline; Bellingham to reject contract,"May 9, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/football-transfer-rumours-messi-bellingham-9-5-2023,feed
Eintracht Frankfurt set Randal Kolo Muani price tag,"May 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/eintracht-frankfurt-set-randal-kolo-muani-price-tag,"The emerging France international has enjoyed a breakout 2022/23 campaign at both club and international level, impressing at the World Cup - his miss in the final against Argentina aside - and scoring 21 goals in all competitions for Frankfurt.  These performance have, as expected, caught the eye of a number of clubs throughout Europe. 90min understands that Kolo Muani has attracted interest from Napoli, Barcelona, Newcastle, Atletico Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester United and Bayern Munich in recent months.  It is Bayern who are firmly the frontrunners to sign the striker however. 90min reported last week that the Bavarians had held talks with the player's representatives over a potential move, viewing Kolo Muani as the ideal replacement for Robert Lewandowski - who left the club last summer. They have even backed away from long-term target Harry Kane in preference for the 24-year-old Frenchman. feed Since Lewandowski left, Bayern have been forced to play Sadio Mane out of position as a striker or utilise veteran former Stoke player Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting as their starting number nine - something which is far from ideal.  In light of Bayern's interest, Eintracht chief Hellmann was asked about Kolo Muani's future, and quoted the huge transfer fee that would be required to sign him. âKolo Muani? When I look at the international market, I imagine a different number than â¬90m - more than this. He has a long-term deal. My absolutely ideal scenario would be that he stays with Eintracht,"" Hellmann explained.  That statement backs up a recent report from 90min that Frankfurt have no intention of selling their prized asset during the summer. Sources have additionally now confirmed that Bayern are not keen on spending upwards of â¬100m on the striker, but talks over a potential transfer are still ongoing. "
Barcelona tell Ansu Fati he can leave amid Premier League interest,"May 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-tell-ansu-fati-he-can-leave-amid-premier-league-interest,"Messi is determined to head back to Camp Nou this summer, having left to join Paris Saint-Germain in 2021. His return is also seen as a priority for the club, but Barcelona are having to work tirelessly on constructing a deal that wonât fall foul of La Ligaâs financial regulations. Fati was once billed as the future of the club, even inheriting Messiâs iconic number 10 shirt at the age of 18. But injuries in recent seasons have hampered his progress and, even now back consistently fit, the 20-year-old has only been an occasional player in Xaviâs team â just 11 of his 31 La Liga appearances so far in 2022/23 have been as a starter. However, a deal to try and move him on is not straightforward, nor is one close. feed 90min can confirm that agent Jorge Mendes did try to engineer a recently rumoured swap deal with Premier League side Wolves involving midfielder Ruben Neves. But sources have confirmed that while Barcelona do admire Neves, he is far from a top priority this summer â the Catalans are more enamoured with Ilkay Gundogan, who would be available on a free transfer. Wolves are keen on Fati, though, and he also has other interest from England in the shape of West Ham. The Spain international isnât particularly keen on leaving Barcelona as it is. But even if he were, teams that are 13th and 15th respectively in the Premier League standings wonât cut it. Fati would want to join a bigger club that is challenging towards the top end of the table. Manchester United, Arsenal or Chelsea have all been linked in the past, but none of them have any irons in the fire when it comes to a Fati deal at this moment in time."
Dusan Vlahovic interested in move to Premier League,"May 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/dusan-vlahovic-interested-premier-league-transfer-man-utd-arsenal-chelsea-newcastle-aston-villa,"The Serbian striker joined Juve during the 2022 January transfer window, said to have spurned interest from Arsenal in order to sign for La Vecchia Signora for â¬70m. After a solid first half season with his new club, Vlahovic has largely struggled for form during the current campaign.  Vlahovic had recently gone eight games without a goal before scoring against Lecce and Atalanta in the last week, and has been in and out of the starting XI under Massimilano Allegri. The striker's goal against Atalanta came in a game during which he suffered a barrage of racial abuse from La Dea fans - something he was then ridiculously booked for reacting to.  FIFA president Gianni Infantino has been among the number of high-profile people who've come out to condemn the abuse Vlahovic received, calling on the FIGC apply 'strict sanctions' on Atalanta fans.  feed The incident on Sunday, coupled with Vlahovic's lack of consistent gametime, have led to the Serbian becoming increasingly unsettled at Juve. 90min understands that he is now keen to leave Turin and his representatives are trying to make his preferred move to the Premier League a possibility. As 90min reported at the time, Vlahovic was offered to Manchester United in January and sources have confirmed that they are among the clubs interested in Vlahovic, with the striker being on the Red Devils' list of forward options heading into the summer window. United also harbour an interest in Tottenham star Harry Kane and Napoli goalscorer Victor Osimhen. Arsenal, who have been long-term admirers of Vlahovic, also retain an interest, and 90min understands Chelsea, Newcastle United and the highly-ambitious Aston Villa are on the list of clubs all mulling over a move for the young striker during the summer transfer window"
Harry Kane hints at upcoming talks with Spurs chairman Daniel Levy,"May 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/harry-kane-hints-at-upcoming-talks-with-spurs-chairman-daniel-levy,"Kane was keen to leave Spurs in the summer of 2021 when Manchester City were determined to sign him, although he has always denied he went as far as refusing to train in an effort to force a transfer. Bayern Munich havenât hidden their desire to sign Kane over the past year, while 90min has reported in recent weeks on both Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain's interest in the 29-year-old.  90min also understands that Spurs are bracing for Chelsea interest in their talisman. As things stand, contract talks with Kane are on hold. Those discussions are set to continue once a new permanent manager is appointed â Julian Nagelsmann and Luis Enrique have each been spoken to about the job, but Spurs continue to also consider a number of alternative options, including Xabi Alonso and Ruben Amorim. No decision is yet close, however. feed ""Thatâs down to the club,â Kane said on the hunt for a manager. âIf I end up speaking with the chairman towards the end of the season, then Iâm sure heâll fill me in on what heâs thinking,â hinting that he could be set for talks with Levy at some point. âBut ultimately weâve got three more games, we donât want to look too far ahead and get too carried away. The club will make the best decision for everyone, for the players, the fans, for the club in general, so weâll just have to wait and see what that is.â 90min understands that in an attempt to convince Kane to commit his future to the club, Spurs are willing to include him in key decisions like hiring the new head coach. Indeed the hierarchy are touching base with the wider squad to gauge their feelings over the job. But by consulting Kane in particular, it is hoped that he would be completely happy with the choice and sign a new deal."
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang names club he wants to leave Chelsea for,"May 8, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/pierre-emerick-aubameyang-names-club-he-wants-to-leave-chelsea-for,"Aubameyang played for Barcelona between February and September of 2022 after agreeing a mutual termination of his contract at former club Arsenal. He was actually a hit during his first few months in La Liga, managing 11 goals in 17 appearances to help steady the ship for Barcelona during a difficult season on and off the pitch.  Aubameyang then made the move to Stamford Bridge for a reported fee of around Â£10m to work with Thomas Tuchel again - his former coach at Borussia Dortmund. After Tuchel was sacked by new owner Todd Boehly and replaced by Graham Potter, Auba was quickly ostracised and was even left out of the club's UEFA Champions League squad for the knockout rounds.  feed Following Potter's sacking, the striker has found his way back into the team on a more regular basis under caretaker manager Frank Lampard, making a number of cameo appearances for the Blues.  However, speaking on the DjamLife TikTok feed, the extra gametime has not changed the forward's mind regarding his Chelsea future, with Auba stating which club he'd like to join in the summer: ""I'd like to return to Barcelonaâ¦but we will see."" 90min understands that the 33-year-old has been told he can leave and would be available on a free transfer. But while Barcelona have him on their list of possible targets, their first choice to bring in up front remains Athletico Paranaense teenager Vitor Roque. Barcelona have enjoyed a fantastic 2022/23 campaign and all set to secure their first La Liga crown in four years as they sit 13 points clear of second-place Atletico Madrid with just five games remaining.  While their league form has been sublime, however, Xavi's side have struggled in cup competitions - both domestic and European - due to a lack of quality depth in the squad, something signing another forward could help rectify heading into next season.

Gundogan bagged himself two goals in the weekend win over Leeds United at the Etihad Stadium and, speaking after the game to the press, Pep Guardiola pleaded with the German to commit his future to the Citizens. He said: ""I said about the contract, the club is involved and knows my opinion. They are above me, we take the decision together, good and bad.

The midfielder's current deal at the Etihad Stadium expires in June and, despite Guardiola's pleas, 90min understands Gundogan is currently edging towards a move to Barcelona.  Sources have confirmed the former Borussia Dortmund midfielder has been offered a two-year deal at Camp Nou, with an option for a further year, and the player's family are keen to live in Spain. Talks between Gundogan's representatives and Barcelona are currently ongoing, and 90min understands Aston Villa-bound Mateu Alemany is keen to announce an agreement by the end of May - prior to his move to Villa Park."
Marcel Sabitzer makes admission over future as Man Utd loan nears end,"May 7, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/marcel-sabitzer-makes-admission-over-future-man-utd-loan-nears-end,"Sabitzer joined United on a short-term deal until the end of the season in January, providing additional cover to a midfield that had recently lost Christian Eriksen to injury. The Austrian has made a decent impact across his 17 appearances in all competitions so far and, even though Eriksen has since returned to fitness, 90min has already recently revealed that manager Erik ten Hag is keen to make Sabitzerâs deal a permanent one. But the 29-year-old has revealed he is yet to speak to his parent club about the situation. âOf course, there hasnât been any contact up until now, because they have a lot going on and so do we,â Sabitzer has told Sky Sports Germany. âEveryone is focused on their tasks. Weâll discuss and analyse everything calmly and see in which direction itâll go.â feed Things have changed at Bayern since Sabitzer left Munich in January. He was out of favour under Julian Nagelsmann, who has since been replaced by the aforementioned Tuchel. However, 90min understands things with regard to his status at the Allianz Arena are unlikely to be much different. Bayern are not expected to stand in the way of a permanent transfer and would sell for a fee similar to the â¬16m (Â£14.2m) they paid RB Leipzig in the summer of 2021. Other clubs are interested in Sabitzer, but he has settled at United and they are his first choice. Unitedâs ideal situation ahead of next season is to sell a midfielder not in the clubâs long-term plans â Scott McTominay, valued at Â£30m, or Fred â and buy Sabitzer while still in overall net profit. There are then also ambitions to sign a new starting ânumber eightâ."

A shoulder injury did rule Phillips out of action for just shy of two months prior to the World Cup, but Rodri's place at the base of midfield hasn't really come under threat at any point. 90min revealed at the end of March that Phillips is contemplating his future at City, who are chasing a third successive Premier League title under Guardiola. West Ham are known admirers of Phillips and made a cheeky bid to sign him towards the end of the 2022 January transfer window - when he was still a Leeds player. That bid was turned down, as was an offer for team-mate Raphinha, but Phillips has remained on West Ham's radar despite going on to join City. Guardiola was asked about Phillips' future prior to City's Premier League clash with Leeds, where he put the emphasis on the player to prove that he wants to stay at the Etihad. ""It depends on the players,"" Guardiola said. ""At the end we're here, I try to be honest with the questions and my feelings. feed ""My feelings sometimes change. But at the end it belongs to the players, they have to convince themselves and the team and not because I say something.

It's how they perform, many things can happen."" 90min understands that West Ham are making their interest in Phillips known, as they prepare for bids to come in this summer for captain Declan Rice. Arsenal and Chelsea are both interested in signing the 24-year-old, who the Hammers value at around Â£100m, while City themselves have renewed their interest in the event of Phillips, Ilkay Gundogan and Bernardo Silva departing. West Ham have also made noises about City full-back Kyle Walker, who is no longer a regular starter under Guardiola. The Spaniard recently said that the former Tottenham star 'cannot play' in his revamped tactical system - which demands full-backs to invert and play in central areas - and has fallen behind John Stones and Manuel Akanji in the pecking order. City have also been hugely impressed by the emergence of Rico Lewis, who they are preparing to tie down to a new contract, and that could open the door for Walker to move on this summer. One stumbling block could prove to be Walker's excessive pay packet, but sources have told 90min that West Ham are monitoring his situation. Aston Villa and Sheffield United, both former clubs of Walker, have also been linked."
Man Utd favourite questions ability of transfer target Jurrien Timber,"May 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-favourite-questions-ability-transfer-target-jurrien-timber,"The 21-year-old has long been linked with reuniting with Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford, and 90min revealed in March that Timber remains a player of interest. Timber has confessed that he will assess his future in the summer, having chosen to remain in Amsterdam despite having opportunities to leave the Eredivisie and further his career. Manchester United are keen to strengthen their defensive options this summer and are also willing to let existing players leave - Harry Maguire a potential casualty if Ten Hag is able to shape his squad in the way he wants to. But former United defender Stam, a treble winner under Sir Alex Ferguson in 1999, isn't fully convinced by Timber's ability to play at centre half, even though a move would see Ten Hag reunited with a player he helped develop and break into Ajax's first team. ""The big advantage of United for Timber is that he already knows Ten Hag and vice versa,"" Stam told Dutch outlet AD. ""The intentions of the trainer are molded to Timber, but make no mistake: this is the Premier League. ""There you can't always be dominant, you have to duel much more against strikers like Harry Kane and Erling Haaland. feed ""Everyone with Lisandro MartÃ­nez was also curious about that. It turns out that he did it.Â With Timber, I just miss a certain amount of aggression - sometimes even being a little mean - in his game. 'That is also, for example, in giving the first blow before the real duels come. Martinez does. You can learn that too, but it has to be in you. Timber has also been linked with United's bitter rivals Liverpool, but Stam does think that United is the right fit if he plays at full-back instead of centrally. ""You also have to look at combinations and chance of playing time,"" the Dutchman continued. ""United can still use a defender, also because Raphael Varane is prone to injury and Harry Maguire is still disappointing. 'In England I therefore see United as the most logical option. And what I would like to see more often is Timber as a right back.Â There are at United, Dalot without the ball and Wan-Bissaka on the ball don't quite convince me yet."""
Jurgen Klopp reveals Liverpool's stance on 'overpriced' players,"May 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jurgen-klopp-reveals-liverpool-stance-overpriced-players,"The Reds have had a disappointing season by their recent standards and barring a late collapse from Manchester United, are likely to miss out on qualifying for next season's Champions League. Injuries have played a significant part in Liverpool's decline, particularly up front, but midfield fragilities have been exposed a number of times as more and more teams have found a way to combat Klopp's high-intensity style. Brighton & Hove Albion star Alexis Mac Allister is currently Liverpool's primary midfield target, and 90min understands that the Reds are hoping to get a jump on their Premier League rivals by concluding an early deal for the World Cup winner. Chelsea duo Mason Mount and Mateo Kovacic and Bayern Munich's Ryan Gravenberch are other midfielders being eyed by Liverpool, though moves for those three could be dictated by a domino-like effect in the transfer market triggered by Jude Bellingham's decision to join Real Madrid. With a number of clubs shopping in the same space, there's a danger of player prices being overly inflated as selling parties look to engineer the best possible deal. But after withdrawing from the race to sign Bellingham for those reasons, Klopp says Liverpool will not pay over the odds for anyone, regardless of the need for fresh faces. feed ""If they are overpriced we cannot do it. We cannot buy the player then. We will bring in players. I am pretty sure we will bring in the players we want and those who will help us,"" the German said.  ""I am pretty confident of that. You never know 100% until they are signed but it is not new that some clubs might try that [to raise the asking price]. ""Let me say it like this: You identify a position and you have not only one option on the position. That means they should all be good, to be honest really good. You might have a favourite but if the other club doesnât want to sell or someone else will pay the price then we cannot go with it, but usually we got the players we wanted."" One midfielder heading for the Liverpool exit door is veteran James Milner, who is closing in on a move to high-flying Brighton. Klopp would ideally have liked the 37-year-old to stay at Anfield for another year, and spoke of him in glowing terms when pressed on his future. ""Milly knows how highly I value him,"" Klopp said. ""Heâs an incredible part of this team and I would have loved to have worked together with him even longer.â"

Bayern Munich to pursue new striker target following Harry Kane warnings,"May 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-to-pursue-new-striker-target-harry-kane,"The Bavarians are looking to add a striker to their ranks this summer having failed to replace Robert Lewandowski in 2022, with club president Herbert Hainer confirming these plans upon their exit from the Champions League at the quarter-final stage last month. They first made their interest in Kane public in July 2022 when then-boss Julian Nagelsmann - ironically now in the frame for the Spurs job - admitted his admiration in the England captain, infuriating opposite number Antonio Conte. Several senior figures at Bayern have spoken of their adoration for Kane in interviews since, though often have stressed that the finances behind a deal would be a stumbling block. 90min has long reported that Bayern believe Kane would be open to a move abroad, and while this is still the case, sources have confirmed that they are starting to get cold feet. Bayern have held talks with intermediaries and the general feedback has been that any negotiations for Kane would not be easy and they are determined not to get dragged into a lengthy transfer saga. feed 90min understands that while Kane is keeping his options open and a move to the Allianz Arena does still appeal to him, he is delaying a decision on his future until Tottenham appoint a new head coach and director of football, at which point he will reassess contract negotiations. His current deal expires in 2024. But Bayern want to move swiftly in their search for a striker and are now strongly pursuing backup target Randal Kolo Muani. Eintracht Frankfurt are currently asking for â¬100m for the France international, which is a sum Bayern are unwilling to reach and talks are continuing. Head coach Thomas Tuchel was asked about the club's interest in Kolo Muani at a press conference on Friday, initially laughing before replying: ""I cannot confirm that [he is a target]. I wouldn't confirm it even if it were the case. At the moment, that's not a topic."" Kolo Muani has scored 21 goals in 41 games for Frankfurt since joining from Nantes last summer, while he starred in France's run to the World Cup final in Qatar, famously being denied by a superb Emi Martinez save in the last minute of extra-time."
Brighton confirm signing of Joao Pedro from Watford,"May 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/brighton-confirm-signing-joao-pedro-watford,"The 21-year-old previously played in the Premier League for the Hornets and has netted 11 goals in the Championship this season. The fee agreed between the two clubs is worth over Â£25m. 90min revealed in late April the transfer would be a club record for Brighton, whose previous biggest outlay was the Â£20.7m they forked out for Enock Mwepu in 2021. Pedro will join the Seagulls when the transfer window officially opens. He is another young talent to add to their forward line alongside Evan Ferguson, who has netted four league goals this season.  Technical director David Weir said: ""Joao has been a long-term target of ours, and he has also attracted a lot of interest from across Europe. manual ""So, we are delighted to have reached an agreement with a key target for the club ahead of the summer window opening, and it is great for Joao that he can focus on the new season, with his immediate future settled. ""He's a brilliant young talent, technically very good, quick and with an eye for goal. He will complement our existing forward line very well. He also has settled well here, with good experience of both the Premier League and Championship and more than 100 games for Watford. ""We are really looking forward to starting work with him in pre-season, here in the UK and when we travel to the United States for the Premier League Summer Series."" Pedro joined Watford from Fluminense in 2020 and scored his first goal in England's top flight a year later against Manchester United."
Man Utd make decision on permanent Wout Weghorst signing,"May 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-make-decision-on-permanent-wout-weghorst-signing,"United have struggled to convert chances in the Premier League this season - scoring only 49 goals in 33 matches to date - and missed a host of chances in their late defeat to Brighton on Thursday night at the AMEX Stadium. Manager Erik ten Hag knows that striking efficiency needs to be addressed as the chief port of call ahead of next season, and has recognised that current options Wout Weghorst and Anthony Martial are not capable of being primary centre forward options beyond the end of the current campaign. Weghorst was signed on a six-month loan in January following the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo, and 90min understands United have made a decision not to extend the loan or seek a permanent deal for the 30-year-old, who is contracted to newly-promoted Burnley. United paid Â£2.5m to secure the loan deal but will move on to other targets come the summer, with Weghorst only managing two goals in 26 appearances in all competitions to date. He is yet to score in a Premier League appearance for United. feed Martial has taken the majority of the minutes Weghorst was receiving since his return from injury, and 90min has learned United are hoping to offload Martial in the right circumstances. Martial has missed 17 league games this season due to injury, while United would like to move on from his large wage packet as they enter the second summer of an overhaul of the playing squad.  Paris Saint-Germain have been long-term admirers of the 27-year-old and it's understood United will not demand a huge fee if they're to part ways with Martial, though it remains to be seen how much interest there will be in the player, who was sent on loan to Sevilla in the second half of last season. Offloading Martial and deciding against the purchase of Weghorst would leave United short of centre forward options, though they do have the option to play Marcus Rashford through the middle if required. Rashford has, however, found his best position from the left of the attack under Ten Hag, and has enjoyed the best scoring season of his career with 29 in all competitions to date. United would like to continue with Rashford from the left and find a long-term answer at centre forward to complement him, and the club have been exploring what it would take to convince Tottenham to part with Kane, the England captain. Kane, along with Victor Osimhen - who this week won Serie A with Napoli - are among a batch of targets who would be ready to take the role of first choice centre forward straight away, while as reported last month, Dusan Vlahovic and Lautaro Martinez are considered alternative options. United see another group of younger forwards as ""project players"", with likely cheaper transfer fees and room for improvement under Ten Hag's coaching. Moves for RB Leipzig-bound Benjamin Sesko, Ajax's Mohammed Kudus and Atalanta's Rasmus Hojlund have been explored. The club have not yet made a decision on which target to press ahead with, but will look to do so over the coming weeks as the situation over the club's ownership becomes clearer, while they are close to returning to next season's Champions League."
What Jurgen Klopp had to say about Alexis Mac Allister Liverpool transfer,"May 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/what-jurgen-klopp-had-to-say-alexis-mac-allister-liverpool-transfer,"The Reds have long been tipped to add midfield reinforcements to their squad this summer following a season in which their weaknesses in this area have been greatly exposed. 90min reported earlier on Friday that Liverpool are indeed hoping to sign up to three midfielders in time for the 2023/24 season, with Mac Allister replacing Real Madrid-bound Jude Bellingham atop their shortlist. Liverpool intend to push ahead with a move that could be completed by the end of May. One player who could be making the reverse journey from Anfield to the Amex Stadium is James Milner. Sources have told 90min that Brighton are closing in on a deal for the veteran utility man with his contract up at the end of the season. Klopp was asked about both Milner and Mac Allister on Friday ahead of Liverpool's Premier League clash with Brentford this weekend. ""All others things, transfer-wise, you will be the first to be informed if something will happen,"" Klopp said. ""But before then, nothing really to say about it."" feed On Milner in particular, Klopp said: ""Milly I can say, over the years and months that I had really good conversations with him. He knows how highly I value him. He's an incredible part of this team and I would have loved to have work together with him even longer. ""What exactly the outcome will be of his decision, I think Milly will say that at one point. I'm not sure if it happened already or not, I'm not really aware of that. ""Nothing else to say from me but nothing will change. I've said it a couple of times, what happened over the past seven and a half years, all the positive things, none of it would happen without James Milner."" In addition to Mac Allister, there are a number of other midfielders that Liverpool have their eyes on. 90min understands that the likes of England internationals Mason Mount and James Maddison are on the Reds' radar. Liverpool are believed to be the frontrunners to sign Ryan Gravenberch should he leave Bayern Munich this summer, with the Dutchman asking the German champions to soften their stance over a potential exit. Klopp previously stated that his scouts have eyes on at least 12 midfielders."
Eddie Howe shares Newcastle transfer plans ahead of Champions League qualification,"May 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/eddie-howe-shares-newcastle-transfer-plans-champions-league-neymar,"Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe insists that the club will only sign the ""right players"" as they continue their progression under new ownership - but will have to keep a close eye on finances at the same time. The Magpies are closing in on a place in the Champions League with five games of the domestic season remaining, holding a six point lead over fifth placed Liverpool with a game in hand. They welcome second placed Arsenal to St. James' Park this weekend. Newcastle will inevitably need to plan ahead and with potential qualification for the Champions League coming ahead of schedule this season, thoughts will soon turn to how they get their squad ready to compete with Europe's elite. Majority shareholders PIF are the wealthiest owners in the Premier League, and have already spent nearly a quarter of a billion pounds on players since taking over the club in late 2021. feed 90min revealed earlier this week that PIF were keen on bringing Brazilian Neymar to the club, which they feel would be within their means. Qualification for the Champions League will also free up spending power under FFP rules. However, Howe remains reserved about possible targets and the finances behind them - in a week that also saw them linked with Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. ""Since the takeover, naturally everyone has assumed that the biggest names in world football will be going to Newcastle. Now, weâve not recruited in that way. Financially, we canât recruit that way at the moment,"" said Howe ahead of the weekend clash with Arsenal. ""But also, we have to bring the right people and the right players into the group. I will say that the transfer market is such a complex decision. You canât just pick a name and bring them in â thereâs got to be a lot of thought goes into what weâre doing, both financially and looking at the players. ""It doesnât frustrate me because the players you mention are incredible players. I donât waste any time over speculation. I know what direction I want to take the team in."""
Chelsea & Man Utd target Victor Osimhen sends transfer message after Napoli title win,"May 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-man-utd-target-victor-osimhen-sends-transfer-message-napoli,"Napoli's 1-1 draw with Udinese was enough to earn them a first league title since the days of Diego Maradona; a rich reward for a 2022/23 campaign that has seen the club blitz clear of Lazio, Inter, Milan and Juventus. Osimhen's contribution to Napoli's cause has been invaluable. The 24-year-old has bagged 22 goals in 27 Serie A appearances, while also netting five goals in six Champions League outings. His blistering form has captured the attention of Chelsea and Man Utd among others, and 90min understands that the former are confident they can lure Osimhen to the Premier League even though Champions League football will not be on offer at Stamford Bridge next season. If a deal is to materialise, interested parties will likely need to stump up at least Â£100m to satisfy Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis, who has publicly stated that the Nigerian goal machine is not for sale. Osimhen was Napoli's goalscorer on the night they secured the title, and he was asked after the game about what winning the title meant to him in addition to questions about his future. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the former Lille forward was coy about his next steps. âIt is a fantastic emotion for me, we waited so many years to bring the Scudetto to Napoli and we succeeded, it is a day we will never forget for the rest of our lives,"" Osimhen replied to DAZN. feed ""Now letâs go celebrate with the public in our stadium. [Is it the] greatest satisfaction of my life? I couldnât have quantified this feeling, it is truly wonderful. At the beginning of the season we were underdogs, not many people believed in us but thanks to the union, a great coach, the president and everyone in the club we were able to believe in the Scudetto and win it. Now we enjoy the moment."" ""Itâs not the right time to discuss my future,"" he added of his future. ""I just want to enjoy this incredible title. I canât wait to return to Napoli and hug the fans - Iâm so happy for them. ""In what aspect do I feel I have improved in Serie A? I will forever be grateful to this league, to this competition. As I always say, I am learning the role of a striker and with Napoli it was immediately good emotions. I feel I have improved a lot, thanks especially to [Luciano] Spalletti and his staff, they gave me confidence to be able to grow and score a lot of goals."" Osimhen has just over two years remaining on his contract in Naples and is believed to be earning around â¬4.5m (Â£3.9m) per year - an amount that is likely to increase considerably should he decide to make the move to the Premier League."
Liverpool keen to finalise early Alexis Mac Allister transfer,"May 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-keen-to-finalise-early-alexis-mac-allister-transfer,"The 24-year-old has been one of the Premier League's most consistent players this season, and scored a clutch penalty for Brighton in their 1-0 win over Manchester United on Thursday. The goal was Mac Allister's ninth Premier League strike of the 2022/23 campaign, with his contributions in midfield helping push Brighton towards a top-six finish and qualification for next season's Europa League. Mac Allister's prolonged outstanding form has attracted the interest of a number of Premier League clubs, and the Argentine, who lifted the World Cup with his country in December, looks set to leave the Amex Stadium this summer in a bid to further his career. Liverpool, who are looking to bring in up to three new midfielders this summer, are heading the queue for Mac Allister, 90min understands, and talks have taken place with the player's representatives and his father, Carlos - who confirmed last month that he was looking to strike a deal before the end of the season. The Reds are fearful of rival clubs coming in for Mac Allister, and that's a key reason for them wanting to strike a deal sooner rather than later. However, Brighton are in no hurry to sell as they know Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham, Chelsea and Newcastle are all keeping tabs on the situation. feed Mac Allister signed a new and improved contract before the World Cup, which puts Brighton, who have previously received significant transfer fees when selling Ben White and Marc Cucurella among others, in a strong negotiating position. Indeed, sources have told 90min that a deal may need to be worth as much as Â£70m to Mac Allister away from the south coast, with the Seagulls only willing to do business on their terms. As it stands Brighton hope that Mac Allister will be their only major departure this summer, but a number of the club's players are continuing to attract interest. Ecuadorian midfielder Moises Caicedo was the subject of bids from Chelsea and Arsenal in January, and although he has since signed a new contract, the Seagulls are anticipating renewed interest in his services this summer."

Newcastle owners exploring blockbuster Neymar transfer from PSG,"May 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/newcastle-owners-exploring-blockbuster-neymar-transfer-psg,"PIF want Newcastle to make a 'marquee' signing this summer, and believe the fact they are set to finish in the top four and qualify for the Champions League should be used to their advantage. A potential move for Cristiano Ronaldo has also been discussed by PIF, and they do have a direct relationship with his current club Al-Nassr, but the 38-year-old is not considered a natural fit in the Newcastle team moving forward by manager Eddie Howe.  Sources insist that despite interest in Ronaldo, they would not, and will never, force any player into the manager's squad that he and the coaching staff didn't want to integrate. Neymar, however, is a different case. Newcastle are in the market for a left-sided forward before next season and would like to strengthen their squad ahead of their likely return to the Champions League - adding desired star power in the process. feed 31-year-old Neymar is also seen as a relatively natural fit within the squad which would also continue to elevate its quality - a strong Brazilian contingent has already been built, with Bruno Guimaraes and Joelinton two of the club's most popular and in-form players this season. 90min understands that PSG are open to selling Neymar in the summer as they look to fix what many consider a broken culture at the club, with Lionel Messi's departure also confirmed earlier this week after an unauthorised trip to Saudi Arabia. He has been suspended from the club for two weeks and will leave when his contract expires in June. Neymar could be next on the agenda, though PSG realise only a handful of clubs in the world would be able to facilitate a deal for the Brazilian. He still has two years left on his current contract with an option to extend by a year, but PSG want to part ways before next season.

Sources have told 90min that PSG would likely require a deal in excess of Â£75m, but with PIF, and Champions League financing, that would not be an issue for Newcastle. Newcastle know they can afford the deal, but also believe they could offer Neymar a move to a club where he would be 'loved' and 'worshipped' by the club's fanbase. Marketing opportunities are also, clearly, an option that any club looking to sign him would take into consideration. Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea are also been linked with a move, and 90min understands that all the Premier League's major clubs are being kept abreast of developments with Neymar and his future by the player's representatives."

With Arsenal now a point behind Man City and having played a game more, their title challenge is likely to fall short, but they have already achieved their pre-season aim of returning to the Champions League, securing their first top-four finish since 2016. Down the stretch of this season, Arsenal's lack of depth has been exposed and they are in need of reinforcements if they are to compete on all fronts next year. Sources have told 90min that the north Londoners are targeting a right winger, centre-back, central midfielder and perhaps a centre forward in the summer. There are several players on Arsenal's shortlist of wingers, including Barcelona duo Raphinha and Ferran Torres. 90min reported in January that the Gunners targeted the duo as alternatives to Chelsea-bound Mykhailo Mudryk, before eventually settling on a more attainable option in Brighton's Leandro Trossard. feed Arsenal also tried to sign Raphinha from Leeds United last summer prior to his move to Camp Nou. Other wingers on Arsenal's transfer radar include Bayer Leverkusen's Moussa Diaby, who has been a long-term target for Newcastle United and has always eyed a move to the Premier League. However, with PSG set to lose Lionel Messi and potentially Neymar, his hometown club are hugely interested in a reunion. Out-of-contract Crystal Palace star Wilfried Zaha is still admired by Arsenal and contact has been made regarding a potential move, though he is only a backup option at this stage.

Liverpool pulled out of the race to sign Bellingham in April as their squad-wide rebuild takes shape, leaving Los Blancos and Manchester City as the main contenders for his signature. Dortmund also held out hope he would sign a new contract but with a fair release clause to kick in for the summer 2024 window. 90min has long stated that while Dortmund will cooperate with Bellingham to help him seal the transfer of his choosing, they will stand firm and demand a club-record fee - this currently stands at â¬144m, which was paid by Barcelona for winger Ousmane Dembele in 2017. Sources have now told 90min that although the footballing world now expects Bellingham to head to Spain, Dortmund have not yet heard from the 19-year-old or Real Madrid to confirm his plans. feed Sporting director Kehl was asked by Sky Sports Germany of Real Madrid's advancing interest, but was dismissive with his answer. ""We want to become champions here in Bundesliga, it's out total priority. We're subordinating everything else to that right now,"" he said.

Right at the top of Messi's list of preferred destinations is Camp Nou and Barcelona are working tirelessly to try and work out a way to bring the 35-year-old back on a deal which will not fall foul of La Liga's financial rules, which were the reason he left in the first place. feed Barcelona president Joan Laporta sees Messi's potential return as a priority for this summer but there is plenty of work to do and no guarantees it will be possible. Messi has received a rival bid from Saudi Arabia which would make him the highest paid player in history. The World Cup winner is already an ambassador for the country, has long been identified as a dream signing there, and the proposal is under consideration. Another viable option is a move to Major League Soccer with Inter Miami, although it is understood that Messi would prefer a move to America later in his career. Despite suggestions of interest from the Premier League, sources close to Messi insist no offers have arrived from England."
Man Cityâs midfield transfer options after Jude Bellingham Real Madrid blow,"May 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-city-midfield-transfer-options-jude-bellingham-real-madrid-blow,"Manchester City had genuine hope that they could persuade the 19-year-old to continue his career under the watchful eye of Pep Guardiola, but Real Madrid now look to be closing in on a deal after holding further talks with his representatives. Bellingham's stock is perhaps the highest of any footballer in the world. Tipped for greatness on the world stage, he's had City, Real and Liverpool in the palm of his hands over the past 12 to 18 months, with each club putting forward their case that joining them would give him the best possible platform to showcase his talent. City's argument is pretty compelling. They have Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland on their books - undoubtedly two of the best players in the world - and an overall squad that is the envy of every team in England and almost all in Europe. They also have Guardiola at the helm until at least 2025, with his reputation as the world's top coach continuing to soar as City's dominance, which could yield a first Champions League success in June, continues. But with Bellingham now out of their grasp, City must regroup and plan their next steps. Not only is a move for the future of England's midfield not happening, Bernardo Silva is pushing for an exit from the Etihad Stadium this summer and club captain Ilkay Gundogan could be joining him - the 32-year-old is out of contract and has attractive options to find a new challenge. That leaves City, potentially, needing to rebuild a core part of their midfield, though luckily their extensive scouting of the transfer market means they are not short of options after missing out on Bellingham. With just two years remaining on his contract this summer, the time for Declan Rice to leave West Ham appears to be now. The 24-year-old is a star turn in both the defensive and box-to-box midfield role, and although he doesn't offer the same level of attacking threat that Bellingham does, his overall game is incredibly impressive and more than suitable for a team competing for honours. Excellent at intercepting the ball in the passing lanes, Rice is also brilliant on the ball - he has superb close control, a burst of pace that rarely sees him outrun in midfield, and the ability to drive forward into space and be a threat in the final third (check out his goal against Gent in the Europa Conference League for evidence of that). Renewed energy in midfield could be exactly what City need, particularly with Gundogan's departure looking more and more likely too. Arsenal and Chelsea are also interested in Rice, making a deal more complicated to complete, but he remains near the top of the club's shortlist. Not much more needs to be said about Chelsea's sorry 2022/23 campaign - but the obvious thing that needs emphasising is that good players will be departing this summer to reduce the size of the squad. One of those leaving west London could be Croatian midfielder Mateo Kovacic, who has crept onto the radar of City, Manchester United and Liverpool in recent months and could be available for a reasonable, by Premier League standards at least, price. Kovacic is another well-rounded midfielder who is more than capable of mixing it at the highest level, although he'd the first to admit that his performances for Chelsea during 2022/23 have been below par. Widely regarded as one of European football's brightest young prospects, Bayer Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz is firmly in City's crosshairs. The German attacking midfielder would have been a bigger star than he is now were it not for a serious knee ligament sidelining him for nine months, but his stock has risen again after some impressive showings under Xabi Alonso. Whether or not Wirtz will be allowed to leave Leverkusen is another matter - he's contracted to the club until 2027 - but Barcelona are also sniffing and Newcastle, soon to be Champions League qualifiers, are known to have been interested previously. Another potential young gun for City to move for is Celta Vigo's Gabri Veiga, though he'll be difficult to attain given the large amount of interest in his services. The 20-year-old Spaniard is courting interest from Real Madrid, Barcelona and a number of other clubs - Manchester United, Newcastle, Arsenal and Tottenham among his Premier League suitors - and is available for a relatively modest â¬40m - a release clause that was inserted into the new contract he signed last year. However, the allure of playing for Guardiola could be a deciding factor in what Veiga decides to do next, with scouts parricularly impressed by his playmaking abilities and composure on the ball. Another player attracting a significant amount of interest is one a little closer to home - Brighton's World Cup winner, Alexis Mac Allister. The Argentine has enjoyed a wonderful season to help push the Seagulls towards European qualification next year, but it appears he is ready to take the next step in his career after honing his craft under Graham Potter and then Roberto De Zerbi. The sticking point for City could be Brighton's lofty valuation of Mac Allister - they have proven with the sales of Ben White, Leandro Trossard and Marc Cucurella that they won't be bullied into selling players on the cheap - and he could command a fee of as much as Â£70m. Money isn't an issue for City as Bellingham would have cost far more, but resale value in the future and Mac Allister's adaptability to different systems may be taken into consideration before any move is made. The most appealing option to Manchester City may be former academy graduate Romeo Lavia, who was allowed to join Southampton at the beginning of the season to play regular first team football. Crucially, City inserted a buyback clause into the deal, though that Â£40m option doesn't become active until 2024. With Southampton looking more and more likely to be relegated, the Premier League champions elect may be forced to move quickly to secure the Belgian - Arsenal and Chelsea are showing serious interest. The Saints are likely to sell to get the possible price, with Lavia a decent bet to actually become the most complete player overall. feed"
Shirt numbers Jude Bellingham could wear at Real Madrid,"Jun 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/shirt-numbers-jude-bellingham-could-wear-real-madrid,"The midfielder has put pen to paper on a six-year deal at the club, with Los Blancos paying an initial â¬100m fee for his services. Bellingham is set to become the first Englishman since David Beckham to bear the white of Real Madrid. But which number will accompany him on those famous old strips? Here is Bellingham's shirt number history and the options currently available to him at the Santiago Bernabeu. feed There are a few other numbers that Bellingham has donned while on international duty with England at various age levels. Well, Jude, I'm afraid I've got some bad news - none of the shirt numbers you've previously worn in your career are currently up for grabs at Real Madrid. The number 7 is taken by Vinicius Junior, 8 by Toni Kroos, 18 by Aurelien Tchouameni, 21 by a returning Brahim Diaz, 22 by Antonio Rudiger and 23 by Ferland Mendy. The number 26 is forbidden for senior players due to La Liga registration rules decreeing they must wear shirts between one and 25. With Diaz likely to leave once again this summer, following a loan move to AC Milan during the 2022/23 season, the number 21 jersey could become available for the midfielder.  If Bellingham doesn't fancy that, then the numbers 14 and 25 are available to him too."
Real Madrid close on Jude Bellingham deal after key weekend meeting,"May 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/real-madrid-close-on-jude-bellingham-deal-key-weekend-meeting,"The 19-year-old has quickly emerged as one of the world's elite midfielders ever since his move to Borussia Dortmund in 2020. His future has been the hot topic of discussion all season long, with Real Madrid mainly competing against Manchester City and Liverpool for his signature. feed 90min reported in April that Liverpool had cooled their interest in Bellingham this year, leaving Real Madrid and Man City in the race, while Borussia Dortmund still had hope that he could sign a new contract with a fair release clause. But sources have now confirmed to 90min that after a meeting between Bellingham's father and Real Madrid chief scout Juni Calafat on Monday, the midfielder is close to reaching an agreement to head to the Santiago Bernabeu. Calafat has been responsible for the recruitment of some Real Madrid's brightest young stars in recent years, including Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, Eder Militao, Endrick and now Bellingham. Real Madrid's pursuit of Bellingham is part of the reason why contract talks have slowed with fellow midfielder Luka Modric, who is likely to see his chances limited by the Englishman's arrival. Los Blancos have already agreed terms over a new deal with Toni Kroos and he is likely to be the only veteran out-of-contract midfielder to stay in the Spanish capital. Borussia Dortmund will still crucially demand a club-record fee in order to sell Bellingham this summer - this figure stands at over â¬144m, which Barcelona paid to sign Ousmane Dembele in 2017."
Football transfer rumours: Ronaldo wants Al Nassr exit; PSG to run Messi contract down,"May 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/football-transfer-rumours-ronaldo-al-nassr-psg-messi-3-5-2023,feed
Cristiano Ronaldo turned down by non-league side,"May 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/cristiano-ronaldo-turned-down-by-non-league-side,"Reports from across Europe claim that Ronaldo wants to leave Al Nassr just five months after heading to Saudi Arabia. His stint in the Middle East has been far from successful from a playing standpoint despite his lucrative salary - they have fallen behind in the race for the Saudi Pro League title and eliminated from every cup competition. Ronaldo found himself short of suitors when he tried to force an exit from Manchester United last summer, so it's hard to imagine where any new interested parties could emerge from. Chelsea explored a deal before then-manager Thomas Tuchel fought back against the wishes of co-owner Todd Boehly, while Bayern Munich and Eintracht Frankfurt had to publicly deny that they wanted the Portugal star. feed Back in England, the National League play-offs are about to begin, with six sides vying for promotion to the fourth tier of League Two. One of the teams in the mix is Bromley from south-east London. The Twitter account for Vanarama - the sponsors of the National League - photoshopped Ronaldo into their kit on Tuesday. Nah, you're alright. https://t.co/aBGwyLUeQZ But swiftly and sternly, Bromley moved to nip this in the bud, responding with: ""Nah, you're alright."" The move serves as a blow to Ronaldo who is now likely to end the 2022/23 season without silverware - a National League play-off medal will remain missing from his mantlepiece."
Bayern Munich ready to listen to offers for Sadio Mane,"May 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-ready-to-listen-to-offers-for-sadio-mane,"Mane joined Bayern from Liverpool last summer in a deal worth around Â£35m but the Senegal international has failed to hit the heights expected of him, recording seven goals and four assists in 22 Bundesliga outings. Off the field, Mane has also attracted unwanted attention after a physical altercation with teammate Leroy Sane which saw him handed a suspension and a fine. Sources have confirmed to 90min that new Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel has not been impressed by Mane and has made it clear to those in charge at the Allianz Arena that he is prepared to offload the 31-year-old this summer. Bayern have long been planning to sign a new central striker this summer, with the likes of Tottenham's Harry Kane and Eintracht Frankfurt's Randal Kolo Muani on their radar, and Tuchel is willing to cash in on Mane to help fund such a move. feed While Mane's age means Bayern are unlikely to demand a significant fee for his services, there is an awareness that his wage demands will limit the number of sides able to strike a deal. Interest in Mane is expected from the Premier League, where Mane racked up 111 goals and 47 assists across 263 games for Liverpool and Southampton, while Bayern also see Paris Saint-Germain as viable suitors. As well as a new central striker, Bayern are also known admirers of Chelsea forward Kai Havertz and could pursue a move for the German this summer. While Havertz has spent most of his Chelsea career in a central role, Bayern are understood to see the 23-year-old as a replacement for Thomas Muller, who has made a career out of floating around behind an out-and-out striker."
Bayern Munich hold talks over Eintracht Frankfurt's Randal Kolo Muani,"May 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-hold-talks-eintracht-frankfurt-randal-kolo-muani,"The 24-year-old has enjoyed an outstanding debut campaign in the Bundesliga, contributing 13 goals and ten assists in 28 appearances after joining on a free transfer from Nantes following the expiry of his contract. Kolo Muani has added a further seven goals in Champions League and DFB-Pokal competition, while he also enjoyed a prominent showing at the World Cup finals with France. Able to play anywhere across the forward line, Kolo Muani has attracted the interest of a number of top clubs through his good form - Napoli, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Newcastle and Paris Saint-Germain among the sides to show interest. Manchester United have also looked at Kolo Muani as they bid to sign a new number nine, but sources have confirmed to 90min that Bayern Munich are firmly in the mix and have held talks with the player's representatives over a potential summer move.  feed The Bavarians are still looking for a replacement for Robert Lewandowski, who departed for Barcelona last summer, and are exploring their options with Sadio Mane's arrival not working out as planned. Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting has led the line for Bayern for most of the season, with Mane playing a peripheral role because of injury and ill-discipline, but he's 34 and unlikely to fire Bayern to domestic and European glory - his ten-goal return this season is the best of his career to date. Frankfurt would like to keep Kolo Muani for one more season and have made it clear up to this point they do not want to sell, but 90min understands that they will allow him to leave if their valuation is met - though it may take a bid close to â¬100m for Bayern or any other interested party to get a deal done."

Fikayo Tomori attracting Premier League interest,"May 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/fikayo-tomori-attracting-premier-league-interest,"Tomori swapped Chelsea for Milan in 2021 and has enjoyed a sensational few years in Serie A, winning the league title in 2021/22 and helping to steer the Rossoneri to the semi-final of this season's Champions League. Saturday's 1-1 draw with Roma was attended by numerous scouts from across England who were keeping an eye on several players. Roma striker Tammy Abraham was a primary focus but sources have confirmed to 90min that Tomori was a key target for many. The 25-year-old only managed 45 minutes of action, picking up an injury and being replaced at half-time, but there was still time for scouts to update their reports of Tomori. 90min understands that Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle were all paying close attention to Tomori during the game, while former employers Chelsea were also watching their former academy star's progress. Liverpool are not believed to have been represented at the game but the Reds are known admirers of Tomori as well. feed Sources state that Tomori would be interested in a return to the Premier League as he believes such a move would aid his quest to feature regularly for the England national team. Despite loud calls from England fans, Tomori has not featured for England since June 2022 and has just three caps to his name, and he was not part of the squad for the 2022 World Cup just six months after winning the Serie A title. âThere was a disappointment not going to the World Cup but that's football, you just have to move on,â said Tomori after his omission from the tournament was confirmed. 90min understands that Tomori sees a return to the Premier League as the best route to more minutes for his country and he would consider offers to return this summer."
Aston Villa confident of signing Tammy Abraham despite European interest,"May 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/aston-villa-confident-of-signing-tammy-abraham-european-interest,"The 25-year-old is into his second full season at AS Roma after joining the club from Chelsea for a reported Â£34m fee in 2021, and has scored 25 Serie A goals during his time in the Italian capital. Eight of Abraham's goals have come during the 2022/23 campaign, and he scored a crucial goal at the weekend to earn Jose Mourinho's Roma a 1-1 draw with UEFA Champions League semi-finalists AC Milan at the Stadio Olimpico.  It was a goal that was witnessed by a number of top clubs from around Europe, with 90min understanding that Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham, Newcastle, Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich all sent scouts to watch the game. Abraham is understood to have been the 'centre of attention' for many of those clubs, but sources have told 90min that Aston Villa remain confident of signing a player who fired them to promotion to the Premier League during a hugely successful 2018/19 loan spell - 90min first reported the Villans' interest in February. feed Indeed. Abraham scored 25 goals in 37 Championship appearances for Villa, before returning to parent club Chelsea to become first choice under the management of Frank Lampard. To facilitate a move though, Villa will likely need to stump up at least Â£40m for Abraham, which would break the club's transfer record - Emiliano Buendia is currently their record acquisition in a deal that could eventually be worth Â£38m to Norwich City. Sources have further confirmed to 90min that Abraham was not the only player attracting attention during the game, with defensive midfielder Sandro Tonali of interest to Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham, and Rafael Leao under the watchful eye of Chelsea and PSG - the Portuguese international is expected to stay at Milan, however, and is closing in on a new contract."
Man City set Bernardo Silva price tag as Barcelona & PSG eye summer transfer,"May 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-city-bernardo-silva-price-tag-barcelona-psg-summer-transfer,"Silva was keen to leave City last summer for Barcelona, but the club stood firm and told the Portugal international he would not be allowed to leave this season. Barcelona also came calling in January, but again City insisted that he would remain part of their squad until this summer at least. Now, the Catalans are ready to return ahead of next season to try and get Silva once more - if he pushes for the move as expected. Pep Guardiola has long made it clear to all his players that he does not want anyone to stay if they do not wish to play for the club, no matter who they are. City have shown that in recent years allowing the likes of Leroy Sane, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Gabriel Jesus to leave the club. City sources insist that same would be true of Silva, despite his importance to the team - if he wants to leave, he can. But the former Monaco star is under contract until 2025 and any club wanting him will have to pay his market value, which 90min understands is seen at around Â£75m. Paris Saint-Germain are huge fans of Silva and are ready to make a move. Yet it is clear that if he does decide to leave the Etihad Stadium, he only has eyes for one club and that is Barcelona. feed However, Barcelona are keeping eyes on more than just Silva. They are keen on a number of players this summer, including fellow City midfielder Ilkay Gunodgan, who has the added benefit of being available as a free agent if his contract runs down - 90min has already reported that an agreement is close even though City are holding onto hope a new deal could be agreed. But despite pushing for Gundogan and Silva, Barcelona's priority signing is still Lionel Messi. They are working hard to put together a deal, which also needs to be ratified by La Liga, who refused to do so with previous contracts for the likes of Gavi and Ronald Araujo. Barcelona are confident of finalising a deal for Messi, as well as resolving other issues. But, to pursue a deal for Silva, they are going to have to raise funds. That means player sales and whilst they could cahs in on Frenkie De Jong and Ousmane Dembele, it does highlight that a Silva transfer is going to be difficult to pull off in the circumstances. It is understood that if Barcelona are not able to agree terms, Silva won't otherwise push to leave City and will stay in Manchester. Indeed, City sources have also not ruled out tying him to a new deal, if a switch to Camp Nou does not materialise."
Paulo Dybala offered to Premier League sides as bargain release clause kicks in,"May 1, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/paulo-dybala-offered-to-premier-league-sides-as-bargain-release-clause-kicks-in,"The 29-year-old joined on a free transfer from Juventus last summer and has enjoyed a successful year under Jose Mourinho, racking up 16 goals and eight assists in 34 appearances and helping inspire Roma to the Europa League semi-finals. Dybala's contract contains a handful of release clauses - â¬20m for fellow Serie A clubs and just â¬12m for overseas teams - and sources have confirmed to 90min that the Argentine's representatives have been making sure clubs in the Premier League are aware. Indeed, 90min understands that Dybala's potential availability has been communicated to Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Manchester United, Newcastle and Tottenham. While none of the English sides have immediately dismissed the offer, there are long-standing concerns that Dybala is not interested in a move to the Premier League and any efforts to sign him would ultimately prove futile. Even if a club does trigger Dybala's release clause, the final decision will rest with the 29-year-old. feed Dybala has been of interest to clubs in England for a number of years now, with his departure from Juventus on a free transfer last summer seen as an opportunity for a real bargain, and while any suitor would have to pay a fee to sign the forward this summer, there is an awareness that â¬12m still represents incredible value. There is, however, a potential stumbling block when it comes to Dybala's significant wages, which could ultimately price some of the Premier League sides out of a move. Roma boss Mourinho recently admitted that Dybala is good enough to play for 'the biggest clubs in the world' but urged the Argentine to put his happiness first. ""My feeling is that he was seeking the joy, he had lost more than confidence,"" Mourinho told Sky Sport Italia. ""He found it here. He has found a coach who understands him, a crowd that loves him and a space on the field in which to be a leader with his quality and personality. ""Dybala is a nice boy. He has the quality to play for the biggest clubs in the world, but he has found joy here."""

After a record-summer transfer window spend of over Â£270m, Chelsea replaced fan-favourite manager Thomas Tuchel with Graham Potter. Further big-money transfers followed in January to create a seriously bloated squad - one that was literally too big for some of Chelsea's Cobham training facilities - and Potter fell victim to these manic changes with his sacking in April. Frank Lampard has lost all five of his games in caretaker charge of Chelsea, who now sit 12th in the table and still have to play all of the Premier League's current top four before the end of the season. Klopp's Liverpool have also endured a disappointing season with their own squad in need of refreshing, but in an interview with Sky Sports, the German coach felt vindicated that spending vast sums of money will not always provide a cure to such turmoil. ""I feel a little bit for Chelsea to be honest, because it's not going well. I think they're a top, top team but on the other side, it's good to see that you cannot just bring top players together and think it works out,"" he said. ""You have to build a team and that's what the guys there underestimated and gave their coaches a nearly impossible job to do. ""You cannot have two dressing rooms, you cannot train on two pitches, you have to create relationships, you have to create team spirit, and thatâs the only reason why I'm a little bit happy about it."" manual Klopp added: ""Chelsea will be fine in the end and they will be incredibly strong next year, but I'm using them just as an example. ""At the highest level, no, we cannot do it like that. And that's what we [Liverpool' will not do. ""You have to bring in the right players and build a new team. This team wrote a sensational story and now we start a new one, that's it.""

Liverpool have been scouring for alternatives to Borussia Dortmund's Jude Bellingham after withdrawing from the race to sign him this summer. feed They are pushing hard to sign Gravenberch either on loan or for a permanent deal which could see Bayern double their money on him - the German champions paid Ajax an initial â¬18m last summer, with a further â¬5m in add-ons yet to be paid. The Reds have not been dissuaded by Bayern's current stance as they believe Gravenberch is determined to seek an exit, particularly with Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka currently preferred to him on top of Konrad Laimer joining from RB Leipzig this summer. Arsenal and Manchester United are also keeping an eye on the situation, but his most likely destination at this point appears to be Anfield."
Tottenham braced for Chelsea interest in Harry Kane,"Apr 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/tottenham-braced-chelsea-man-utd-interest-harry-kane,"Kane's contract at Spurs runs until 2024 and talks over a new one are on hold until the club appoint a permanent head coach. 90min has long reported that Tottenham are confident of securing the 29-year-old's long-term future and this remains the case. However, that doesn't mean that Spurs aren't anticipating a flurry of transfer interest in their star striker. Sources have confirmed to 90min that while Tottenham have not been contacted by teams regarding Kane just yet, they are anticipating that Chelsea and Manchester United will at some point make their interest formally known. The Blues are on the verge of appointing Mauricio Pochettino, who played a huge role in Kane's development during his five-and-a-half years at Spurs, as their new head coach. Pochettino has often suggested that Kane saved his Tottenham career after he scored the winning goal in a late 2-1 victory at Aston Villa early in his reign. Chelsea - among the Premier League's lowest scorers this season with only 30 in 32 games - are in the market for a striker, with Napoli's Victor Osimhen at the top of their shortlist. feed Meanwhile, Man Utd fans chanted 'we'll see you in June' to Kane during Thursday's 2-2 draw at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, which Kane acknowledged when talking to the press post-match. ""I heard what they were saying, but I'm just focused on this team and trying to finish [the season] strongly,"" he said. 90min previously reported that Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain are ready to pursue Kane as they believe he would be willing to move to mainland Europe. Kane is enjoying a superb statistical season despite Spurs' various woes - only Erling Haaland has more Premier League goals this term, while he is now Tottenham and England's all-time leading scorer."
La Liga president explains how Barcelona can re-sign Lionel Messi,"Apr 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/la-liga-president-how-barcelona-can-re-sign-lionel-messi,"Barcelona have exceeded their salary cap by a huge amount and must reduce wages before any new signings or contract renewals can be completed, but that has not stopped them from chasing an eyecatching reunion with Messi. 90min understands that Barcelona are close to an agreement to bring Messi back to Camp Nou and the Blaugrana are working tirelessly to make the deal work financially, with a number of sales on the cards purely to lower the wage budget enough to re-sign the Argentine. Any deals must be signed off by La Liga and Tebas explained what he needs to see before Messi's return will be approved. ""As of today, I see it as complicated,"" he told RMC's After Foot. ""There is still time, but there will have to be departures of players and a decrease in the wage bill. There will have to be if they are to be able to register Messi. feed ""And then there is a piece of information which we don't know, the salary of Messi. There are still many variables to understand. ""Barca is not like PSG, which has a gas and money tap to have a large salary mass. They have to reduce the salary mass to be able to sign up players. It's like the subway, let them out so they can get in. People still have to get out of the subway."" Messi's current employers, PSG, have been trying to tie the 35-year-old down to a new contract but have accepted that he is highly unlikely to extend, with a return to Barcelona high on Messi's agenda. To try and boost their chances of getting a deal for Messi over the line, Barcelona are even understood to be exploring offering him a secondary role behind the scenes, which they believe could help offset some of the cost of his contract."
Chelsea's deal to sign South American wonderkid confirmed by club chief,"Apr 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-deal-to-sign-south-american-wonderkid-confirmed-club-chief,"Paez, seen as one of South America's most exciting young players, is set to join Chelsea in 2025 in a deal which 90min understands could be worth up to â¬20m if all bonuses are triggered. âIt is something that we have already been talking about on a few occasions, a few months ago. There is a specific interest fromÂ Chelsea, it is practically arranged between the parties,"" Morales told Studio Futbol on Paez's future. âLegally we are looking at what can be done, he is a 15-year-old boy,Â FIFAÂ prohibits this type of negotiation. âWe are going to be fortunate enough to be able to enjoy him for at least two more years until he turns 18 and then he can go.â feed Paez, who bagged three goals and five assists in eight games at April's Under-17 South American Championships, is just 15 years of age and will not turn 18 until May 4, 2025. Since 2001, FIFA have prohibited players under 18 from transferring internationally, which is why Real Madrid are also waiting to sign 16-year-old striker Endrick from Brazilian side Palmeiras, with a â¬70m deal already signed. English clubs used to be able to sign young players from inside the European Union, but Brexit now means those players also must be 18 before making the move, forcing the likes of Chelsea to pursue homegrown talents instead."
Brighton finalising club-record signing of Watford striker Joao Pedro,"Apr 28, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/brighton-finalising-club-record-signing-watford-striker-joao-pedro,"Highly rated upon his arrival in England in 2020, Pedro has impressed this season in the Championship but his return of 11 goals and four assists has not been enough to drag the Hornets into the promotion picture this season - Watford sit 13th but can still mathematically reach the play-offs, although they would need a miracle over the final two games of the campaign. With Watford set for another season in the Championship, Brighton have moved quickly to take advantage and agree a fee worth over Â£25m to land Pedro, who will become the Seagulls' record signing if he seals his move as expected, eclipsing the Â£20.7m paid for Enock Mwepu in 2021. Club officials were keen to move quick to fend off interest from rival Premier League sides. Newcastle attempted to land Pedro in the January transfer window but, while still on their radar, he has not been identified as a primary target for the summer. Brighton's interest in the 21-year-old has been driven by manager Roberto De Zerbi, who will be heavily involved in the team's summer transfer plans after an outstanding maiden campaign in the Premier League. feed Primarily a central striker, Pedro has also played on both wings for Watford and even turned out at the top of the Hornets' midfield, with this versatility likely to help him fit in under De Zerbi. Brighton sold Leandro Trossard to Arsenal during the January transfer window and declined to replace him immediately, but Pedro is now expected to fill the Belgian's spot in the squad. There could be further movement at the AMEX Stadium this summer as Brighton anticipate the departure of midfielder Alexis Mac Allister, who is of serious interest to a number of Premier League clubs and is expected to be granted a summer exit. Midfield partner Moises Caicedo is also in demand but Brighton are adamant that they will not be forced into authorising a mass exodus and will only do business on their terms."

Indeed, sources have confirmed to 90min that Arsenal remain interested in striking a deal for Fresneda and scouts were in attendance to watch him in action on Thursday. Aston Villa and Newcastle, who appear certain to finish in the top four after beating Everton 4-1 at Goodison Park, also had representatives present. Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta is understood to have spoken with Fresneda in January about a move to north London and the right-back even took the time to praise Arteta in a recent interview. âI like Arteta a lot because I think heâs a great coach; I follow the European leagues and I think the work heâs doing with his club is fantastic,â Fresneda said. feed Valladolid are huge fans of Fresneda, who has made 20 appearances in all competitions and started 15 times in La Liga, but there is an acceptance that the interest in him will almost certainly lead to a summer exit. Alongside the interest from the Premier League, Fresneda is also on the radar of Real Madrid. He came through Los Blancos' academy before a move to Leganes in 2018 and may be handed the opportunity to return this summer. The teenager has a release clause worth â¬30m in his Valladolid contract and such a price would see Fresneda shatter the club's record sale, which currently stands at the â¬12m raised by Mohammed Salisu's move to Southampton in 2020.  Arsenal are also understood to have used Thursday's game as another opportunity to watch their own former academy gem, Valencia midfielder Yunus Musah. 20-year-old Musah, who left Arsenal in 2019, has attracted plenty of interest from the Premier League and Liverpool were among the clubs in the stands on Thursday to watch the midfielder in action,"

Callum Hudson-Odoi to delay Chelsea future decision until new manager talks,"Apr 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/callum-hudson-odoi-to-delay-chelsea-future-decision-until-new-manager-talks,"The 22-year-old has spent the current campaign on loan with Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen on a deal which, despite the German side's best attempts, does not include an option to buy, meaning Hudson-Odoi will return to Chelsea in the summer. He has endured a challenging spell in Germany which has yielded just seven Bundesliga starts, having found minutes hard to come by under new manager Xabi Alonso. When Hudson-Odoi returns to Chelsea, he will have 12 months on his contract and so a decision will have to be made on his future. The Blues are open to selling the winger but sources have stressed to 90min that Hudson-Odoi wants to speak with the new manager before making any decision on his future. An agreement has been reached in principle with former Tottenham and PSG manager Mauricio Pochettino to move to Stamford Bridge this summer, with the Argentine set to be given plenty of input on which players are kept at Chelsea beyond this season. feed Hudson-Odoi is understood to believe that he can still turn his Chelsea career around and wants to see whether the new manager, likely Pochettino, shares his vision. If Hudson-Odoi does leave Chelsea, the Blues will push for a permanent sale instead of a loan, which would have to include a contract extension as the winger will be in the final 12 months of his current deal. 90min understands that Hudson-Odoi is one of a number of Chelsea players on the radar of AC Milan. Ruben Loftus-Cheek is of serious interest to the Serie A side, who are also tracking Kalidou Koulibaly, Christian Pulisic and Hakim Ziyech. The 22-year-old, famously a one-time Â£30m target for Bayern Munich, has managed 126 appearances for Chelsea, the last of which came in the Club World Cup final victory over Palmeiras in February 2022."
AC Milan interested in summer move for Chelsea's Ruben Loftus-Cheek,"Apr 27, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ac-milan-interested-in-summer-move-for-chelsea-ruben-loftus-cheek,"The 27-year-old, who joined Chelsea 19 years ago, has been a fringe player for the past few seasons and has now entered the final 18 months of his contract at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea's new policy, which aims to prevent players from entering the final two years of their deals, means those on expiring contracts could be sold for the right price, and Loftus-Cheek is among that group of players facing uncertain futures. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Loftus-Cheek has generated plenty of interest from Serie A, where Lazio and Napoli are known admirers, but Milan are emerging as serious contenders for the midfielder's signature. Former Chelsea defender Fikayo Tomori, who came through the academy alongside Loftus-Cheek before his move to Milan, is understood to have given a rave review of the midfielder when asked by his club. feed Loftus-Cheek is intrigued by the idea of moving to Milan and could prioritise a Serie A switch over remaining in the Premier League, where Crystal Palace, Fulham, Leicester, Newcastle, West Ham and Wolves are all keen. With Chelsea faced with a need to sell players this summer, they are open to offers and are keen to take advantage of Milan's interest in a number of players at Stamford Bridge. Kalidou Koulibaly, Christian Pulisic, Hakim Ziyech and Callum Hudson-Odoi are all on Milan's radar as well. Importantly, Milan's interest in Loftus-Cheek and the other players is not currently linked to Chelsea's pursuit of 23-year-old forward Rafael Leao, who is also in the final 18 months of his contract but is in talks over an extension. Chelsea's interest in Leao will remain even if he puts pen to paper on a new deal in Milan and sources expect the Blues to explore a move which could see a number of players head to San Siro in exchange.

The 26-year-old would remain a starter for the majority of the 2021/22 campaign but was an unused substitute for the final five games of the season, and he appeared just twice this year before Rodgers was dismissed, starting October's 1-0 defeat to City before seeing seven minutes towards the end of the 4-2 win over Aston Villa in February. Soyuncu regularly failed to make the bench during Rodgers' final season but has been quickly reinstated by interim boss Dean Smith, starting each of the three games to date.

Bundesliga side Borussia Monchengladbach admire FC Cincinnati star Brandon Vazquez. Vazquez is coming off a breakout 2022 season in which he tallied 18 goals in 33 games.

Romelu Lukaku keen to stay at Inter beyond this season,"Apr 26, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/romelu-lukaku-keen-to-stay-at-inter-beyond-this-season,"Lukaku has seen his time back at San Siro, having traded Inter for Chelsea in 2021, hampered by injuries. But the Belgian striker has started to gain some form since February and has contributed six direct goal involvements in his last eight Serie A starts. He was also on target in the Champions League quarter-final first leg against Benfica, with Inter eventually reaching the semi-finals for the first time since 2010, as well as in the Coppa Italia semi-final first leg against Juventus. Both of those games were this month. In his most recent appearance, Lukaku scored twice and assisted once as Inter beat Empoli to end a five-game winless streak in Serie A.

Chelsea are yet to make a decision and their next permanent manager will be part of that process. 90min reported earlier on Wednesday that a deal has been agreed in principle with Mauricio Pochettino following negotiations in recent days.

Kepa and Mendy are both available for transfer and are not in Chelsea's long-term plans, even if their new manager - expected to be Mauricio Pochettino - likes them.

While the club is expected to play hardball over a transfer fee, Moyes has admitted that he hopes Rice would chose to re-sign with the London club.  manual âHe would be missed by any club, so any club who didnât have him would miss him and we certainly would, partly because he is a big part. âBut my hope somewhere is that Dec thinks this is the best place for him to be and if somebody doesnât come up with the right amount of money, it will continue to be the place he is as well. The club have made that pretty plain, but I hope we can continue to get the best out of Dec.""  Rice has made no secret of his desire to play Champions League football, stating as such during last year's World Cup. âOne hundred per cent I want to play in the Champions League. For the last two or three years Iâve been saying that. Iâve been playing consistently well for my club and I feel like I really want to keep pushing.

Barcelona 'leaving no stone unturned' to finalise dream Lionel Messi return,"Apr 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-leaving-no-stone-unturned-finalise-lionel-messi-return,"90min revealed back in October that Barcelona were 'exploring' ways to bring Messi back to Camp Nou and there's been a growing belief in recent weeks that a return to the club he previously served for 21 years is likely to happen. Indeed, direct contact with Messi's representatives is ongoing and an agreement is close to being reached between the two parties. Messi's current deal at Paris Saint-Germain expires in the summer, and although the Ligue 1 giants have an option to extend by a further year, the contract clause can only be triggered with the 35-year-old's agreement - something he has been unwilling to sanction. PSG's priority was to re-sign Messi to a new contract following Argentina's World Cup success in Qatar, but despite holding talks, the club were kept waiting by the player's camp and were never able to come to an agreement. 90min revealed at the start of April that PSG had all but given up on Messi agreeing a new deal, which paved the way for Barcelona to push ahead with talks. Messi's father, Jorge, has been in constant contact with Barca officials in recent months, including president Joan Laporta, who has never hidden his desire to bring him back to the club. 90min also understands that Barcelona have promised Messi he can take back his old number ten shirt, which currently belongs to Ansu Fati. Laporta is now working hard to complete a deal which will need to be approved by La Liga. However, La Liga president Javier Tebas has already warned the club that big efforts must be made to get any deal through. ""Barca must take many financial measures to undertake Messiâs registration. They need lot of effort to make it happen. Today I don't see his signing as feasible. But thereâs a lot of time left, Barca can still make moves to get Leo. We are still awaiting a feasibility plan from Barcelona. They need a big effort to make it happen,"" Tebas stated earlier this month. feed 90min understands that Barcelona are exploring all possible options to get a deal for Messi through, and an avenue they are evaluating is employing Messi not just as a player, but also as part of the club's hierarchy and maybe even as a board member. This is not a negotiation tactic without precedent. When looking at a possible Cristiano Ronaldo deal last summer, Sporting CP explored making him a part owner of the club, and while that is not an option for Barca and Messi, they do believe the possibility of him being part of the club's off-field business could help off-set his playing contract. Sources have told 90min that although a deal is complicated, 'no stone is being left unturned' by Barcelona to make sure they bring Messi back to the club, but also to ensure that his contract is approved by the authorities. Barcelona have been left hugely annoyed by La Liga's refusal to sanction some of the moves they made last summer such as the handling of Gavi and Ronald Araujo's contracts. They don't want a repeat of those situations with any summer transfers, including Messi. As well as Messi, Barca are also in talks with a number of other players such as Manchester City's Ilkay Gundogan, but they know that in order to push through their plans, then changes to the current squad are going to have to be made. 90min understands that while Barca consider and insist that the likes of Frenkie De Jong and Ousmane Dembele are 'unsellable', the message coming from the very top is that all options will be considered - if that means some star players need to be sold, then so be it. De Jong is a long-term target of Manchester United and could be their most sellable asset if they allow him to leave, while Dembele, who has just over 12 months left on his current deal, is of interest to a number of Premier League clubs and could be sacrificed to facilitate a return to Catalonia for Messi."
Brighton confirm Evan Ferguson's new contract,"Apr 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/brighton-confirm-evan-ferguson-new-contract,"The talented 18-year-old has been rewarded for his stunning breakout under new manager Roberto De Zerbi with a contract until 2028.  90min reported at the end of March that Bayern Munich, Napoli, Chelsea, Newcastle United, Liverpool and Barcelona all scouting the talented 18-year-old - the latter of which told 90min that they see Ferguson as a 'player of huge potential'. Despite said interest, Ferguson wasn't in a hurry to leave Brighton and has now committed his long-term future to the club. Speaking to the club's official website, manager De Zerbi expressed his delight at the news that the Republic of Ireland has signed a new deal: âEvanâs contract extension is great news. He trains and plays like a senior player with many years of experience and has become an important member of the squad. feed âThe aim is to help him become one of the strongest strikers in Europe.â Ferguson joins fellow Republic of Ireland starlet Andrew Moran in signing a new contract at the club this week. 90min understands that Kaoru Mitoma is also set to sign a new deal at the Amex Stadium."
Carlo Ancelotti explains why he would be happy to see Lionel Messi back at Barcelona,"Apr 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/carlo-ancelotti-explains-why-he-would-be-happy-to-see-lionel-messi-back-at-barcelona,"Messi is nearing the end of his Paris Saint-Germain contract, having spent two seasons in the French capital, bringing the 35-year-old to a fresh career crossroad. Beyond Barcelonaâs very public confidence of securing a reunion, 90min reported earlier this month that PSG accept a new deal with Messi is unlikely. A return to Camp Nou, where he spent 21 years until the summer of 2021, is now the more likely outcome. Talks with Barcelona are planned and Messi himself has spent time in the city over the last few days,  spotted out for dinner with former teammates Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba on Monday. Even turning 36 at his next birthday in June, Messi would undoubtedly strengthen Barcelona, already set to win La Liga ahead of Real Madrid this season. But it doesnât bother Ancelotti, who instead suggests it will benefit Spanish football as a whole â Messi means more eyes back on La Liga. feed âMessi can do whatever he wants and Barcelona too. Itâs not an issue for me,â the Real coach said. âI like him as a player. For Spanish football it could be nice to have him. But itâs a matter for Messi and Barcelona.â Messi famously wanted to leave Barcelona in 2020 out of frustration with how the club was being run under former president Josep Maria Bartomeu. But by 2021 he was happy to stay and even agreed a new contract until potentially 2026. However, that deal could not be registered due to La Ligaâs spending rules, which have crippled Barcelona in recent seasons as a result of the poor state of club finances. With no choice but to leave, Messi became a free agent and opted to join PSG on a two-year contract. The seven-time Ballon dâOr winner struggled by his usual standards during his debut season in France but has been much more at home in 2022/23. That being said, his ties to Barcelona, both the club and the city, remain incredibly strong, having spent a third of his life there at the time he left."
Evan Ferguson agrees contract extension at Brighton,"Apr 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/evan-ferguson-agrees-contract-extension-brighton,"The Republic of Ireland international has been one of the Premier League's breakout stars this season, scoring eight goals in all competitions for Brighton and becoming a key player for new manager Roberto De Zerbi. Although he disappointingly missed out on the opportunity to play at Wembley Stadium in Brighton's FA Cup semi-final clash with Manchester United, the club have confirmed that the striker is nearing a return from injury.  Ferguson's impressive form had caught the eye of a number of top clubs around Europe in recent months. 90min reported at the end of March that Bayern Munich, SSC Napoli, Chelsea, Newcastle United, Liverpool and Barcelona all scouting the talented 18-year-old - the latter of which told 90min that they see Ferguson as a 'player of huge potential'. feed Speculation around the young striker's future has now been firmly put to bed however after he signed a new long-term contract at the Amex Stadium. Ferguson joins fellow Irish starlet Andrew Moran in signing a new deal at the club. Moran, an Under-21 Republic of Ireland international, has agreed a new contract which runs until 2027.  Technical director David Weir spoke of his delight at tying Moran down to a long-term deal in a club statement. âAndrew has progressed really well through the academy and has impressed Roberto as part of our first-team squad this season. He has worked really hard to earn this new contract and now his challenge is to break through into the team,â he said."
David De Gea close to finalising Manchester United contract extension,"Apr 25, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/david-de-gea-finalising-manchester-united-contract-extension,"The 32-year-old Spaniard has been in talks with United since last year about a new deal, with his current contract due to expire at the end of this season. United have an option to trigger an automatic one-year extension on his current terms, but have not utilised it - and have instead looked to agree a wage reduction with De Gea from his current Â£375,000-a-week earnings. De Gea is currently United's highest paid player and United have been looking to address their wage structure in recent months. De Gea has now agreed to take a substantial pay cut in order to prolong his stay at Old Trafford. Talks have been ongoing about the length of deal and other add-ons, but 90min understands that there are no ""major"" hurdles left to clear. Only finer details remain to be ironed out. feed United manager Erik ten Hag has made it clear to the club's hierarchy that a new deal for De Gea was the best option at this point, with other areas of the squad seen as a priority to strengthen ahead of next season over a new starting goalkeeper. 90min has however learned that signing a goalkeeper to provide more substantial competition for De Gea should not be ruled out in 2023. De Gea has endured difficult moments this season - none more so than in last week's Europa League defeat against Sevilla - but is leading the Premier League's clean sheet table this season and has received public backing a number of times from his manager. Ten Hag sees De Gea as a key figure in the dressing room and one of his most trusted senior players. De Gea reacted to the loss in Europe with an excellent display in the FA Cup semi-final victory over Brighton and the United boss was quick to praise his number one. âI was very impressed with him, he made some brilliant saves. It hurt when he made mistakes on Thursday. Often when you make mistakes as a keeper you get punished. We let him down, we didnât fight back for him,â he said. De Gea himself has never hidden his desire to stay at United beyond this season. ""I've been in very tough moments for this club. Now I'm enjoying it more,"" De Gea said earlier this month. I think itâs everything, a good manager, good players who bring experience to the team, people who want the ball, who play well with the ball. Itâs a mix of everything. ""Everyone is thinking in the same way, playing in the same way. The team spirit is great from everyone, everyone fights until the end, and everyone is ready from the bench to perform well. Itâs great to watch the team playing and performing well."""

Man Utd & Newcastle retain interest in RB Salzburg's Benjamin Sesko,"Apr 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-newcastle-retain-interest-rb-salzburg-benjamin-sesko,"Sesko, currently of RB Salzburg, scored in a 2-0 away win for his side over Sturm Graz, their closest rivals for the championship in the Austrian Bundesliga, and has hit eight goals in his last seven league appearances. Only turning 20 on May 31, Sesko has been on the radar of a number of European giants - including the two Premier League clubs - for a number of months, though he is scheduled to join Salzburg's sister club RB Leipzig at the end of the season. A â¬24m deal was agreed in 2022 between the two clubs, at a below market rate due to their relationship. As 90min reported in October, that hasn't stopped some of the continent's biggest clubs from exploring the possibility of a deal before the start of the 2023/24 season. Leipzig stand to make a handsome profit on the â¬24m they have committed to sign Sesko even before he kicks a ball for the club due to the interest being shown in him if they decide to negotiate. The benefit in exchange for the potential buyer would be paying a more affordable price before Sesko develops into what many in the game consider to be one of the next leading strikers in Europe. His career path and frame have led to inevitable comparisons with Erling Haaland, who himself came through the Red Bull system and played for Salzburg. Sesko is one of several striking options considered by Erik ten Hag's United and Eddie Howe's Magpies, as they look to strengthen upon potential returns to the Champions League next season. feed Newcastle are looking for a new striker as 90min understands Callum Wilson, who is looking for regular first team football, could potentially leave St. James' Park in the summer. Alexander Isak has hit form in recent weeks and will continue to play his part, but Newcastle are planning to slowly build a squad capable of competing at the top of the Premier League and in Europe in seasons to come. United, meanwhile, are very publicly in the market for a new centre forward, with interest in Tottenham's Harry Kane and Napoli's Victor Osimhen established and well-documented. Both players however would demand significant transfer fees to acquire, so United are monitoring strikers who fit into two different brackets as it stands. Kane and Osimhen, along with Dusan Vlahovic and Lautaro Martinez, of Juventus and Inter respectively, are considered more expensive options considered ""ready to go"" and able to nail down the centre forward role from the start of next season. Kane and Osimhen in particular are considered difficult deals to do, but are being explored. The second bracket of striker is filled with younger options, or ""project players"", with potentially cheaper transfer fees but room for improvement. Sesko fits into that category, while Ajax's Mohammed Kudus, who 90min reported United hold interest in in January, is still being considered. Atalanta's Rasmus Hojlund, Benfica's Goncalo Ramos and Feyenoord's Santiago Gimenez also feature. United are exploring their options at present and pondering how to proceed, with central midfield, centre half and goalkeeper among the positions they are also looking at strengthening before next season."
Premier League clubs scout Jurrien Timber and Ibrahim Sangare,"Apr 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/premier-league-clubs-scout-jurrien-timber-ibrahim-sangare,"PSV and Ajax faced off at Philips Stadion as the home side earned a comfortable 3-0 win thanks to a brace from Luuk de Jong and a spot kick from Xavi Simons. Sources have confirmed to 90min the thrilling contest was enjoyed by plenty of Premier League scouts. Man Utd, Liverpool, Man City, Arsenal, Newcastle United, West Ham, Brentford, Brighton, Wolves and Leeds United all sent representatives to watch a number of highly-rated players. One such player is Ibrahim Sangare, who 90min revealed is keen to test himself in the Premier League. The defensive midfielder's contract - signed last summer - has a release clause of â¬37m and his representatives have alerted the likes of West Ham, Arsenal and Tottenham to his availability during the upcoming transfer window.  Singare's PSV teammate Jarrad Branthwaite - who is on loan from Everton - was also watched closely by a number of Premier League clubs on Sunday. However, PSV have been extremely impressed by the defender and are keen to keep him on the books beyond the 2022/23 season. As for interest in Ajax players, Jurrien Timber was scouted by Manchester United on Sunday. The defender is one of United's top defensive targets ahead of what promises to be a busy summer window. feed The defender can play at both centre-back and right-back and, as 90min reported at the start of March, a source close to the Dutch club quipped Ten Hag ""would take Timber tomorrow"" if presented the opportunity, and that Timber would play anywhere for the manager who introduced him to senior football. After the defeat to PSV at the weekend, Timber was extremely critical of his teammates, revealing in an interview with ESPN: ""I think we just werenât ready today. ""Very annoying. Painful, annoying, you put it well. You can talk a lot, but in the end you have to show it on the pitch. We didnât do that. Itâs frustrating when you donât get into the game, balls donât go in and you concede goals too easily. ""I think everyone takes a good look at themselves. You try to cheer each other up, but that is sometimes frustrating, yes. You try to address boys and keep their spirits up."""
Alexis Mac Allister set for Premier League stay after Brighton exit,"Apr 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/alexis-mac-allister-set-for-premier-league-stay-after-brighton-exit,"The 24-year-old midfielder, who signed a new long-term contract earlier this season, has publicly denied reports that he intends to leave the Amex Stadium this summer, but his representatives, including his father Carlos, are working hard on finding his next club. Liverpool, who are ready to bring in up to three new midfielders this summer, are leading the chase, but 90min understands that Tottenham, Chelsea and Newcastle have all registered their interest in Mac Allister. Manchester City and Manchester United are also understood to be monitoring his situation. Brighton CEO Paul Barber told talkSPORT on Monday that the Seagulls 'don't know' what the summer will bring in regards to Mac Allister's future, but crucially stopped short of ruling out a departure for the 24-year-old. feed Indeed, 90min understands that Brighton, who have been left agitated behind the scenes at his desire to move on, will allow Mac Allister to depart under the right conditions like they have done over the past 18 months for Marc Cucurella, Ben White and Leandro Trossard. But a deal may need to be worth in excess of Â£70m to persuade Brighton to sell their World Cup winner - a price that is likely to rule out a move away from the Premier League and instead leave Mac Allister eyeing up a switch to one of the division's perceived 'big six'. As far as Mac Allister's father is concerned, he is adamant a transfer is in the offing this summer, remarking again to Argentine media at the weekend that he expects a deal to be done. ""The next phase of his career will pass and he will be playing within another institution, we don't know which one as the talking are just beginning in general but most likely by next month,"" he told Argentine outlet Ole.

Compared to the likes of Nani and Leroy Sane for his love of dribbling, Moreira has long been touted as a potential star of the future, with the likes of PSG and AC Milan looking to lure him away from Benfica, but Chelsea are set to win the race for his signature."
Chelsea hatch new plan to keep Liverpool target Mason Mount at Stamford Bridge,"Apr 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-new-plan-to-keep-liverpool-target-mason-mount-stamford-bridge,"Mount is approaching the final 12 months of his current deal and has long been warned that he will be sold this summer if he continues to reject the offer of fresh terms, with the vast majority of the Premier League's elite all keen to sign the 24-year-old if he does leave. As 90min revealed earlier this month, Chelsea have a renewed sense of confidence over Mount's future. While there is still an awareness that an extension is a long way away, the decision-makers at Stamford Bridge believe things are trending in the right direction. A large part of Chelsea's optimism relates to their search for a new manager. Sources have confirmed that Mauricio Pochettino is close to becoming the new Blues boss and the feeling is that this sign of ambition will help convince Mount to stay. However, to boost their chances of keeping Mount, Chelsea are also prepared to offer a short-term extension of one or two years to the academy graduate, which would bring an end to the immediate concerns of an exit and earn Chelsea time to win Mount over. feed Liverpool are seen as the biggest threat to Chelsea's hopes of keeping Mount, with the Reds keen to get a deal done after accepting defeat in their pursuit of Borussia Dortmund's Jude Bellingham, whose â¬150m price tag could be more than double Chelsea's asking price for Mount if he does hit the market. Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle all hold an interest in Mount, as do Bayern Munich following the arrival of former Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel. Chelsea have not given up hope of keeping Mount and will retain their dialogue with the 24-year-old and his representatives as the season approaches its finale with a view to solving one of their biggest dilemmas of the summer. While the Blues do appreciate the money they could raise by cashing in on Mount, there is a belief that there are plenty of other players who could be sold to bring in the necessary money. A significant number of players are unsettled and facing uncertain futures at Stamford Bridge and Chelsea are prepared to listen to offers, especially for those approaching the final two years of their contracts."
Romelu Lukaku sends message to Chelsea over Inter future,"Apr 24, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/romelu-lukaku-sends-message-chelsea-inter-future,"The Belgian striker is currently on loan at I Nerazzurri for the 2022/23 season from Chelsea, having struggled for form during his return to Stamford Bridge for a reported Â£97.5m.

The hope was that Lukaku could re-find the form he showed at Inter during his previous two-year spell at San Siro, when he scored 64 goals to lead the club to a Serie A title.  That hasn't proven to be the case however, as the forward has continued to struggle in front of goal - scoring just five Serie A goals this season thus far.

At the end of February, Inter's CEO Giuseppe Marotta confirmed that Lukaku is set to return to Chelsea at the end of the 2022/23 season, but the club will assess their options regarding a future transfer or an extension of his current loan deal in the summer:  ""Talking about [Lukaku staying] is premature, at the moment we have the goal of finishing the season in the best possible way, then we will have to think about the hypotheses for next year,"" Marotta toldÂ Sky Sport Italia. ""Lukaku is a Chelsea player today. At the end of the season, he will return there and then a new scenario will open up and we'll see what to do.

Juventus progressed to the semi-finals after holding Sporting to a 1-1 draw back in Portugal. Adrien Rabiot opened the scoring on the night before Marcus Edwards equalised from the penalty spot. Massimiliano Allegri's men then weathered a Sporting storm to secure their passage to the last four, where they will meet Sevilla following their elimination of Manchester United. 90min understands representatives from Aston Villa, Liverpool, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur were at the Estadio Jose Alvalade to watch the match, with scorers Rabiot and Edwards among the players being closely monitored. feed Back in March, 90min reported Liverpool and Spurs had asked to be kept informed about Rabiot's contract situation at Juve with his deal set to expire in the summer. Man Utd also retain an interest after coming close to signing the midfielder last summer. In regards to Tottenham academy graduate Edwards, Spurs agreed to waive a portion of a sell-on fee owed to them by Sporting during negotiations to sign Pedro Porro in January. The versatile Pedro Goncalves, who 90min understands is hugely admired by Tottenham, was also watched over on Thursday. Aston Villa and Liverpool remain interested in the Portugal international too."
Liverpool's stance on Fabio Carvalho's future following debut season,"Apr 21, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-stance-fabio-carvalho-future-debut-season,"The midfielder joined from Fulham for an initial Â£5m last summer after a deadline day move in January 2022 fell through. He arrived on Merseyside to much fanfare after playing a pivotal role in Fulham's superb 2021/22 campaign, being named in the PFA Championship Team of the Year after playing a starring role in their title win. Carvalho quickly endeared himself to Liverpool supporters when he scored a 98th-minute winner against Newcastle United at the end of August. But the 20-year-old has played just 632 minutes in all competitions for the Reds this season and has scarcely made an impact during his first campaign with the club. feed Sources have told 90min Liverpool have informed Carvalho they plan to send him on loan next season in search of regular first-team football. However, a permanent move away is not being considered, with Carvalho determined to become a Liverpool regular in years to come. Right-back Calvin Ramsay and goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher have also been told they can leave on loan, with Liverpool hopeful of finding Premier League landing spots for them."

Toni Kroos agrees Real Madrid contract extension,"Apr 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/toni-kroos-agrees-real-madrid-contract-extension,"The 33-year-old's current contract was due to expire at the end of the season, but Real Madrid always wanted him to stay and talks over a new deal have now been finalised. Kroos did have other options with big money offers from both North America and the Middle East on the table, but he is staying put in Spain. Sources have told 90min that Kroos has agreed terms on a one-year extension at the Santiago Bernabeu, which will see him into his tenth year with the club having joined from Bayern Munich in 2014. Kroos follows in the footsteps of Karim Benzema in committing for another 12 months as 90min revealed last month, and fellow stalwart Luka Modric is expected to follow suit. feed Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti, who himself looks set to remain for at least another year, has stated that he does not want to be without his three legends next season. ""I see the three of them as always. They can have their best and worst moments during a season but that's quite normal,"" Ancelotti said earlier this year. ""We have to evaluate players not by age but by what they actually do and you can think that the three of them don't have the energy of the youngsters but the way they handle games and the experience they have you can't buy in any market in the world. ""I think they will continue but we will have to think about when they stop because it will happen. Maybe they don't have the physique of young people, but while age takes away some things, it gives you others."" As well as continuing talks with Modric, Real Madrid are also in negotiations with Dani Ceballos and Marco Asensio. Both are out of contract at the end of the season and have options from around Europe to move on free transfers, but Spanish sources believe the most likely scenario will see them both remain at the club."
Crystal Palace and Wolves interested in Atletico Madrid's Matt Doherty,"Apr 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/crystal-palace-wolves-interested-atletico-madrid-matt-doherty,"The Republic of Ireland international joined Atletico Madrid on January transfer deadline day, signing a six-month contract at the Civitas Metropolitan Stadium after his contract at Tottenham was mutually terminated. Doherty was initially supposed to join Atleti on loan until the end of the season, but due to Tottenham already having too many players out on loan they were forced to terminate the wing-back's contract in order to sanction the move. Since making the move, Doherty has very, very rarely featured for Diego Simeone's side. To date, the 31-year-old has played just 12 minutes of competitive football in one substitute's appearance.  feed 90min understands that the wing-back is not going to sign a new contract at the club once his six month deal runs out and is now expected to sign for a Premier League club. Sources have confirmed that Crystal Palace, his ex-employers' Wolves, Burnley and Sheffield United are all interested in signing Doherty as a free agent this summer. Doherty has previously spent 10 years on the books at Wolves, becoming one of the league's premier wing-backs for a short period at the tail end of his time at Molineux before joining Tottenham for a reported Â£13.5m in 2020."
Top Premier League clubs monitoring Valencia star Yunus Musah,"Apr 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/premier-league-clubs-monitoring-valencia-yunus-musah-arsenal-chelsea-liverpool-newcastle,"The  20-year-old enjoyed a brilliant World Cup with the United States, helping them to the last 16. Valencia recognised his increased stature and opened talks over a new deal late last year, but talks have not yet produced an agreement. However, part of that has been due to the club's own struggles. Financially, the Spanish club are not in the best shape and fan protests against owner Peter Lim have ignited in recent months. Performances on the pitch have also played a part, with the club entrenched in a relegation battle in La Liga. The former back-to-back Champions League finalists are currently third from bottom and have recently appointed 2000s legend Ruben Baraja to try and save them from the drop. With all their issues, it is perhaps no surprise that Musah is now looking at his future. 90min understands he is now ready to move on from Valencia, haing joined in 2019 upon deciding to leave Arsenal's academy. He he could even soon be back in north London. feed Arsenal, as 90min revealed earlier this season, are one of the clubs keeping a close eye on Valencia and Musah's situation. The Gunners are very much in the market for a midfielder this summer and Musah is a player they already know, but also one they have been doing work on. Chelsea and Liverpool were among the clubs who were already keeping tabs on him before the 2022 World Cup, which only underlined his potential. They, like Arsenal, have both remained in contact with the player's representatives. Newcastle and Brighton, each hoping to offer European football next season to any prospective new arrivals, have also joined the list of interested parties. Musah has other options to remain in Spain too, as well as across Europe. Atletico Madrid are known to be admirers, whilst Borussia Dortmund, Eintracht Frankfurt and Wolfsburg also appreciate him.  Musah's current contact runs to 2026 with a release clause of â¬100m but given their issues on and off the field, sources have told 90min they would not be able to reject any sort of substantial offer."
Premier League clubs keeping tabs on Noussair Mazraoui situation at Bayern,"Apr 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/premier-league-clubs-keeping-tabs-noussair-mazraoui-situation-bayern-munich,"Mazraoui joined Bayern Munich at the start of the season following the expiration of his contract at Eredivisie side Ajax. The full-back was seen a huge coup for Bayern due to his impressive performances for Ajax during his five year spell at the club. Since making the move to Bavaria however, Mazraoui has struggled for game-time under both Julian Nagelsmann and new manager Thomas Tuchel, being restricted to just 20 appearances in all competitions with just 10 of those coming from the start. As such, sources have told 90min that the player's representatives have begun to gauge interest from other clubs ahead of a potential summer move.  feed Manchester United, Newcastle United, Wolves, Arsenal, West Ham United and Crystal Palace are among the clubs to have been alerted to the Moroccan's potential availability, and will be kept informed of his situation at Bayern Munich in the coming weeks and months. Outside of the Premier League, we understand that Inter, Borussia Dortmund and Atletico Madrid have also been told about Mazraoui's potential availability. The full-back himself, following the club's Champions League exit at the hands of Manchester City, vented his frustration at his lack of playing time, saying: ""I was a starter here before the World Cup. Now Iâm fit and donât get any game time. ""I'm not even second or third choice. It's too early to talk about my perspective here - but it's not good!"""
Bayern Munich president confirms striker pursuit amid Harry Kane interest,"Apr 20, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/bayern-munich-president-confirms-striker-pursuit-amid-harry-kane-interest,"The Bavarians were eliminated at the quarter-final stage of the UEFA Champions League for a third successive season on Wednesday night, succumbing to a 4-1 aggregate defeat to Manchester City. Part of Bayern's problems have been that they have been unable to replace the goals and general all-round presence of Robert Lewandowski, who left to join Barcelona last summer. Veteran journeyman Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting has played up top this season and to his credit has scored 17 goals in 29 games, but Bayern's other options have been limited to using wide men like Sadio Mane and Serge Gnabry through the middle. feed Speaking after Wednesday's game with Man City, Hainer admitted that the lack of a centre forward is a clear tactical weakness that they will look to rectify. ""It was obvious we didn't have a number nine who would change things up front,"" he said. ""You can assume that we'll strengthen our squad to be able to compete in the league and Champions League ""We're missing a striker who can put the ball in the net. That's something we'll certainly need in future. If you can name me someone who can be an immediate hit, we would buy him immediately."" Bayern first made their interest in Kane known last summer when then-manager Julian Nagelsmann publicly revealed his admiration of the striker, even though Tottenham's demands would likely prove too costly for a transfer pursuit. Nevertheless, 90min understands that Bayern remain in the hunt for Kane with his contract set to expire in 2024. Kane will reassess his stance over a new deal with Spurs once the club appoint a permanent successor to Antonio Conte."

La Liga president explains how Barcelona can re-sign Lionel Messi,"Apr 19, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/la-liga-president-explains-how-barcelona-can-re-sign-lionel-messi-psg,"Messi's contract at Paris Saint-Germain expires at the end of the season and a new deal is not close. 90min understands that PSG have accepted that the Argentine is likely to leave following a two-year stint in France, with talks over a return to Barcelona planned. Messi left Camp Nou in 2021 as they were unable to register his contract under strict financial rules implemented by La Liga following the coronavirus pandemic. Barcelona's finances are still in a rather sorry state, activating several 'levers' and mortgaging club assets in order to spend a bit more freely in the transfer market. feed And Tebas has said that BarÃ§a still need to make a few more concessions before they would be able to re-register Messi. ""BarÃ§a must take many financial measures to undertake Messiâs registration. They need lot of effort to make it happen,"" he said. ""Today, I don't see his signing as feasible. But there's a lot of time left - BarÃ§a can still make moves to get Leo. We are still awaiting a feasibility plan from Barcelona. They need a big effort to make it happen. They can sell players, for sure - but they still have some players to register too."" One of the 'players' alluded to by Tebas is Gavi, who has returned to playing under his youth contract after La Liga and Spanish courts ruled that Barcelona could not register a new senior deal. Gavi's contract expires in the summer and has been extensively linked with a move to Chelsea."
PSG ready to enter race to sign Harry Kane,"Apr 19, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-ready-enter-race-sign-harry-kane,"Kane's contract at Spurs expires in 2024, though the club are confident of tying their vice-captain down to a new deal. Sources have told 90min talks will resume once the club appoint a permanent head coach to succeed Antonio Conte. Top clubs are continuing to circle Kane in the meantime, with Manchester United eyeing a move for the 29-year-old. Kane has his eyes set on breaking Alan Shearer's record for Premier League goals, but Bayern Munich are ready to offer him a route out of England should his desire to win trophies slightly outweigh his ambition and they believe they can lure him to mainland Europe. 90min also understands PSG are ready to reignite their interest in Kane should he be open to a move abroad. Club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has always admired the striker, with PSG making their interest in Kane known when he wanted to leave Spurs back in 2021. 90min reported at the time that PSG were able to lean on the fact that Eurostar links and short flights meant Kane would be able to quickly travel to and from his London home, potentially even staying in the English capital and commuting to training and matches. PSG were then managed by ex-Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino, who formed an incredibly strong bond with Kane at Spurs after integrating him into the first-team - Pochettino has often credited Kane with saving his job after scoring a late winner against Aston Villa early in his north London tenure. Though Pochettino has since departed PSG, the Ligue 1 champions' interest remains and Kane could even reunite with another former manager in the French capital. Jose Mourinho is on PSG's shortlist of managers to replace Christophe Galtier should he leave at the end of the season. The Portuguese coach helped transform Kane from a pure number nine into one of the world's most complete forwards, winning the Premier League Playmaker Award at the end of the 2020/21 season."
Ollie Watkins close to agreeing new Aston Villa contract,"Apr 19, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/ollie-watkins-close-to-agreeing-new-aston-villa-contract,"The England international has developed into one of the Premier League's leading marksmen in recent months and has looked completely rejuvenated under Unai Emery during the second half of this season. With Aston Villa now pushing for a European place, they are looking to tie down Watkins for his prime years, and sources have confirmed to 90min that an agreement over a new contract is close. Watkins signed a five-year deal upon signing from Brentford in 2020 for a fee that could reach Â£33m. The likes of Arsenal, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur have all been linked with the 27-year-old, but he is very happy at Aston Villa and will soon affirm his commitment to them with a new contract. Watkins has gone from strength-to-strength since making his Premier League debut, registering double figures of goals in each of his three seasons in the top flight. feed Emery recently spoke of his love for Watkins in a recent press conference, revealing: ""The striker is very important to me. I spoke with [Watkins] at the beginning [of my time here] about the relationship. I told him I want the best of you and the way he is doing - practising, being humble to improve - this is the way. ""Then, he has a big career in his future. It's very important as well to try and speak about other players because he is not going to score if his teammates aren't helping him to do it. For us, Ollie Watkins is very important. He's not only scoring but his commitment every day, trying to add more work, watching his clips. ""He's the first defence in our idea, trying to be consistent. He's working very well with the high pressing. He's trying to fight with the defenders. He's scoring and he's adding the best quality as a striker - the goal."" Watkins has been on a tear in 2023 and is surely at the forefront of Gareth Southgate's thinking once again. No Premier League player has scored more goals this calendar year thus far, firing Aston Villa into European contention heading into the final stretch of the season.

Man City's stance on Kyle Walker future amid Aston Villa links,"Apr 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-city-stance-kyle-walker-future-aston-villa,"Walker has fallen down the pecking order at the Etihad Stadium in recent weeks, with manager Pep Guardiola explaining that he is currently unable to play in his new 3-2-4-1 formation. ""He cannot do it. He will always have pace; Kyle at 60 years old will be the fastest player in this room. To play inside you have to have educated movements - he doesn't have every one of the characteristics,"" Guardiola admitted. ""He has played as a full-back coming inside in the past with four at the back. He has done really well but this shape of three at the back and two in the middle, he cannot do it."" With the likes of John Stones, Manuel Akanji and even Rico Lewis featuring in that new inverted right-back role instead, Walker has become a little bit of a forgotten figure amid Man City's resurgence over the last couple of months. feed He has been linked with a move to high-flying Aston Villa, where he spent the second half of the 2010/11 season on loan from Tottenham. Sources have told 90min that, ironically, former Spurs teammate and near-namesake Kyle Walker-Peters is one player certainly on Aston Villa's radar. However, 90min understands that the former club of Walker's most interested in a reunion is boyhood side Sheffield United. Walker has made no secret of his love for the Blades, notably appearing as an analyst on BBC Sport's coverage of their famous FA Cup win against Spurs at the start of March. Sheffield United would love to bring Walker back to Bramall Lane if they win promotion to the Premier League - they are currently second in the Championship favourites and are expected to clinch the runners-up spot - and a return 'home' would appeal to the England international. Nevertheless, sources have told 90min that City are not actively looking to force Walker out of the exit door, and are happy for him to play out the remaining 14 months of his contract."
Newcastle interested in Barcelona winger Ousmane Dembele,"Apr 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/newcastle-interested-barcelona-winger-ousmane-dembele,"The Barcelona winger, who has just over a year remaining on his current contract, was a surprise attendee at Sunderland's Championship with clash with Sheffield United in March, when he visited friend Kyril Louis-Dreyfus, the former's chairman. Dembele is one of Barcelona's highest profile players, owing to his mega-money move to Camp Nou in 2017, but his career at the club has been dogged by numerous injury lay-offs. Indeed, the Frenchman has played just 120 La Liga games for Barca in close to six full seasons and has been sidelined with a hamstring issue since late January. Dembele's visit to the North East is understood to have only been short, but 90min understands that brief contact was made between the player's representatives and intermediaries representing Newcastle. The PIF-owned Magpies have adopted a relatively cautious approach to their transfer business to date - despite spending heavily on striker Alexander Isak - but qualification for next season's Champions League could accelerate their plans to land a number of elite signings this summer. The 25-year-old would certainly fit that bill and is attracted by the prospect of playing in the Premier League - he came close to joining Chelsea last summer before renewing his contract at Barcelona. feed In order to do so, Dembele took a wage cut in Catalonia - helping the club reduce their spiralling costs - but it's understood that any interest in an extension could be dependant on being offered a wage rise. As it stands, that's unlikely to be on the table from Barcelona, who have plans to re-sign Lionel Messi from Paris Saint-Germain as well as Manchester City captain Ilkay Gundogan and potentially Bernardo Silva. With Messi's fairytale return edging ever closer, Barcelona sources have confirmed to 90min that Dembele could be one of those who makes way, even though the club's hierarchy and manager Xavi think highly of him. The player himself would consider leaving if a suitable offer from Barcelona was not forthcoming, and is acutely aware that he has plenty of options around Europe, particularly in England. As well as Newcastle, Chelsea remain keen, while Arsenal and Manchester City have eyes on his situation.  Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain are also waiting in the wings in case a deal is there to be done."
Why Southampton are ready to sell Romeo Lavia amid Arsenal & Chelsea interest,"Apr 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/why-southampton-are-ready-to-sell-romeo-lavia-amid-arsenal-chelsea-interest,"The Saints brought in the then-18-year-old after he had made just two senior appearances for Man City, but he has quickly blossomed into one of the Premier League's brightest young stars. Lavia made such a great immediate impression on the south coast that Chelsea lodged a bid to sign him late in the same summer window in which he joined Southampton. This approach was knocked back. Despite Lavia's progress, Southampton find themselves mired in the pits of a desperate relegation battle, currently propping up the Premier League table having accumulated only 23 points from 31 games. It is looking likely that Southampton will be playing Championship football next season, and among the star names expected to leave the club is Lavia. feed Sources have told 90min that Manchester City have a Â£40m buy-back option on Lavia which becomes active in 2024. Southampton are keen to do business for a potentially higher price this summer in order to maximise his value. Chelsea are ready to reignite their interest in Lavia despite having a wide array of midfielders already on their books. He is also viewed as an alternative to Declan Rice by Premier League leaders Arsenal. Manchester United and Newcastle United both admire Lavia, but are concerned about adding him to their current squads due to his relative lack of experience. Lavia earned his first senior cap for Belgium during the March international window, coming off the bench for the final 10 minutes of their 3-2 win away at Germany."
Southampton set James Ward-Prowse asking price ahead of expected summer sale,"Apr 18, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/southampton-set-james-ward-prowse-asking-price-ahead-of-expected-summer-sale,"The Saints sit bottom of the table having picked up just 23 points from 31 games and are four points from safety having won just one of their last eight league games. Though relegation to the Championship is far from assured, it is a possibility that is looking far more probable by the week. Sources have told 90min that a number of key players - including Kyle Walker-Peters, Mohammed Salisu, Armel Bella-Kotchap and Romeo Lavia - are expected to leave St. Mary's if they go down. England international and set-piece extraordinaire Ward-Prowse is also prepared to part ways with the club he has represented since the age of eight. 90min understands that Southampton will demand around Â£50m for their club captain, who is the subject of interest from several top-flight sides. feed Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe and sporting director Dan Ashworth are both huge fans of Ward-Prowse. The Magpies are being kept informed of the player's developing situation on the south coast, though their summer business hinges on their final position in the standings - Newcastle currently sit fourth and are on course to qualify for the Champions League. Manchester United also believe that Ward-Prowse could solve some of their own midfield problems, while Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur are also admirers of the 28-year-old. Ward-Prowse is one goal from a direct free-kick away from tying David Beckham's Premier League record of 18. He has scored seven goals and laid on two assists in 31 league games for Southampton so far this season."

Veiga played 64 minutes before being replaced by Franco Cervi. feed Representatives from Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur were all at Balaidos. Arsenal, Brentford, Brighton, Chelsea and Newcastle have all previously watched Veiga this season. 90min understands that of these interested clubs, Man City are pushing hard to strike a deal for Veiga. Real Madrid have previously held talks over a deal for him, but they are also close to tying Dani Ceballos down to a new contract and are still in the race for Jude Bellingham. Upon signing a new contract last year, Celta increased the release clause in Veiga's contract to â¬40m. It is likely that they will demand this in full if they are to sell him this summer, which would make him the club's record sale - Stanislav Lobotka's transfer to Napoli in 2020 for â¬20m stands as their current record sale."

The Italian international was on the scoresheet recently as Inter coasted past Benfica 2-0 in the first leg of their UEFA Champions League quarter-final tie, and his consistent performances have alerted some of Europe's top clubs.

In order to make a move for Barella possible, PSG are willing to include Leandro Paredes in any potential bid - although his form during a loan spell at Juventus has been far from impressive. 90min further understands that there's plenty of Premier League interest in Barella, whose representatives have previously tested the waters regarding a move to England's top flight. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp is believed to be a long-term admirer of Barella, while Manchester City and Chelsea are also keeping a close eye on his potential availability."
Joan Laporta teases Lionel Messi return to Barcelona,"Apr 17, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/joan-laporta-teases-lionel-messi-return-barcelona,"Messi signed a two-year contract with PSG that is coming towards the end. That deal did include a further 12-month option, but the seven-time Ballon dâOr has been weighing things up all season. The 35-year-old is known to be happier in Paris than he was last season after taking some time to settle in the French capital, as 90min reported in February. PSG have been pushing for Messi to make a decision on his future, having already reached a broad agreement over a new one-year deal with an option until 2025. But there is no indication that Messi is ready to sign it and further talks were planned. Barcelona coach Xavi said earlier this year that the âdoors are openâ for Messi to return to Camp Nou and revealed the former teammates are in âconstant contactâ. Laporta, who took office as president for the second time in the final months of Messiâs time at the club, has also been very vocal on the subject virtually ever since the 2022 World Cup winner left. Now, in answering a few short questions from Cadena SER, he gave a firm âyesâ when asked if Messi will be heading back to Barcelona. 90min recently revealed that PSG have accepted Messi is not likely to extend his contract there. His father, Jorge, has been in Barcelona for talks this month. feed If Messi wanted to commit his future to PSG, he missed an opportunity to do just that in recent days when asked about what the next step for him is. âI donât know what my future holds,â Messi said, âAs I said at the beginning, itâs hard for me to imagine, to think about things that could happen but I really donât know what my future will be and it will be whatever it has to be, whatever God wants it to be, will be.â Messi had spent 21 years Barcelona by the time he left in 2021, almost two thirds of his entire life at that point after moving to La Masia aged just 13. He expressed a public desire to leave the club in 2020 in the wake of an embarrassing 8-2 humiliation by Bayern Munich in the Champions League. However, by 2021, he appeared to ready to re-commit and agreed a new contract. It was never signed, though, with Barcelonaâs much publicised financial problems responsible. Even with Messi happy to stay, the club desperate to keep him and the contract agreed, Barcaâs money woes meant there wasnât the funds to register it in line with La Liga spending rules.

12 Jude Bellingham alternatives for Liverpool,"Apr 16, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/12-jude-bellingham-alternatives-liverpool-opinion,"The transfer revelation would have come as a surprise to the Anfield faithful who assumed their club had placed all attention on bringing the teen sensation to operate under Klopp. Their underwhelming season has put Jurgen Klopp under the cosh and the German tactician has set his sights on a significant overhaul. Let's scour the footballing world to see who may be en route to Anfield this summer. Englishman Mason Mount is likely to replace his countryman as Liverpool's priority acquisition this summer, as his hard-working nature fits Klopp's blueprint like a glove. Chelsea owner Todd Boehly has stated that he won't stand in the way of a potential deal which may entice Liverpool's higher-ups to enquire for the Cobham graduate. Liverpool are among a series of Premier League clubs who are interested in signing Chelsea and Croatian star Kovacic. Chelsea may feel inclinced to sell to sort out their financial status. This means it won't be simple to secure his signature and can Liverpool afford to be in a well-contested race when multiple additions are required? Maddison would bring a sense of leadership to Klopp's engine room and that sprinkled with his dangerous dead-ball ability, he'd be a sound addition to a department ladened with ageing, contract-running players. Leicester's most valuable asset has been due a move to one of the league's top sides and it's looking incredibly likely he will be plying his trade elsewhere at the start of the 2023/24 season. Struggling for minutes in Bavaria, the former Ajax midfielder could act as a low-cost alternative to some of the others on Klopp's shopping list. Pictured wearing a Liverpool top amid the interest from Anfield, the Reds faithful are rummaging around the internet to find compilations of the 20-year-old. Wolves' Portuguese ace has been earmarked by Liverpool as a cheaper Bellingham option and would bring top flight experience to a struggling midfield. The Molineux-based outfit have removed his transfer clause from the current deal he has tied up with the club, may hinder Liverpoolâs pursuit. A lack of Premier League experience may mean Klopp would place the Portuguese youngster low on his list of potential incomings.  He is only 23, however,  and would arrive with the aim of becoming a long-term servant for the Merseyside-based outfit. The 26-year-old midfielder will soon enter the final year on his Borussia Monchengladbach deal and so may be available to the German tactician for a realistic price. 90min recently revealed that Liverpool are interested in the player. However, Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal and Newcastle have all done scouting work on will continue watching. feed Though he was moments away to joining table topping Arsenal in the winter, Caicdeo signed a fresh deal with Brighton, which expires in 2027. For a plethora of reasons, it's probable the Ecuador international would cost a pretty penny and so, Liverpool are likely to steer clear of the Â£100m-valued player. Neverthless, securing his services would solve their midfield woes in an instance and would also provide sufficient cover for the long-term.  Adrien Rabiot has previously revealed his fondness for Liverpool, leaving fans with the hope that Anfield will be his next destination. Manchester United's failed approach, however, may mean they come back in for seconds upon the opening of the summer transfer window.  With a World Cup winners medal in a cabinet at home, he will be valued at a premium that Liverpool may shy away from, but what a pick up this would be! Mac Allister would thrive and inject Liverpool with some much-needed creativity, a player which Liverpool have lacked in abundance this campaign. Klopp and his staff should air on the side of caution when negotiating with Brighton as the well-run club may qualify for European football and therefore boost their likelihood of retaining their stars. Quickly establishing himself as one of the league's best holding midfielders, the Portuguese destroyer has received much interest from top clubs. You'd assume the Cottagers would ideally hang on to one of their most prized assets but when a club like Liverpool come calling, you typically answer.  The Belgian international, similarly to Maddison, has been one of Leicester's crucial players in moments where they are needed most - especially when facing a relegation battle.  His contract is up in June, Leicester are fighting for their top division credibility, and he'll bring ample experience with him - what's not to love?"

With the Reds in the market for an alternative to Jude Bellingham after ending their pursuit of the Borussia Dortmund star, Gravenberch looks like he could be part of a viable solution to their problems. Social media sleuths have already worked their magic in finding any past connection of the Dutchman to Liverpool, digging up a picture of him donning a shirt from the 2019/20 season. Gravenberch in a Liverpool shirt ð pic.twitter.com/3jzu5Uxvzd While this image has only resurfaced this weekend, it was first bandied around in Liverpool circles in recent months.  pic.twitter.com/xPqWKn23h9 The shirt features the Club World Cup winners' badge and a patch for the FA Cup and is said to have been gifted to him by compatriot Ki-Jana Hoever, who spent two years at Liverpool. The picture originated from the Instagram page of Leandro Fernandes, who played with Gravenberch also played with at youth level with the Netherlands. Does this mean that Gravenberch is a Liverpool fan? Is he on his way to Merseyside as we speak? Is he singing 'Si Senor' and 'Oh Andy Andy' at the top of his lungs? No. Makes for a nice subplot at least, though."

Gavi's senior contract with Barcelona was rescinded by La Liga and Spanish courts due to the club's unstable situation. His current deal is set to expire in the summer and he will, in the eyes of the law, be allowed to leave on a free transfer, although whether he would want to is a different matter. feed In a press conference ahead of Sunday's trip to Getafe, Xavi was asked about Chelsea's interest in signing Gavi, but he seemed relatively relaxed about the situation.

I think his future is here at the club."" 90min reported last month that Gavi does not intend to leave Barcelona this summer and is intent on staying at Camp Nou.

He has long been linked with a free transfer to BarÃ§a. 90min reported on Friday that a formal agreement to join La Blaugrana has not yet been reached, but one is close. Barcelona's financial woes mean signing players without a transfer fee is appealing - they brought in Andreas Christensen and Franck Kessie on Bosman deals last summer. Speaking to Spanish outlet AS, Gundogan's agent provided an update on his client's future, insisting nothing has yet been finalised. ""I'm surprised about the news regarding an agreement being closed as there's no full agreement with any club now,"" he said. ""It is not yet decided where he will play in the coming seasons.

They currently trail Premier League leaders Arsenal by six points, though have a game in hand on the Gunners and welcome them to the Etihad Stadium later this month. Man City face Sheffield United in the semi-finals of the FA Cup next week, and they have one foot in the last four of the UEFA Champions League after beating Bayern Munich 3-0 on Tuesday night. Over the last few seasons, Gundogan has become one of Man City's most dependable players. His first few campaigns in England were disrupted by injury, while he failed to regularly start over the likes of Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva.

Jurgen Klopp admits interest in '12 midfielders' after ending Jude Bellingham pursuit,"Apr 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jurgen-klopp-interest-12-midfielders-jude-bellingham-pursuit,"90min reported earlier this week that the Reds have backed away from a deal to sign Jude Bellingham from Borussia Dortmund this summer due to the high fee he would command and the need to strengthen in several positions. Liverpool's other targets include Chelsea's Mason Mount and Bayern Munich's Ryan Gravenberch, while the father of Brighton's Alexis Mac Allister has admitted it is likely his son will move on at the end of the season. Speaking at a press conference on Friday ahead of Liverpool's trip to Leeds, Klopp delved into the club's transfer plans and revealed their interest in '12 midfielders'. feed ""We have to make sure, we have to make decisions for the team, for the club, and we cannot dream, we cannot be angry if we donât get this or we donât get that. If thereâs no chance for it, why should we do that?"" Klopp said. ""We cannot discuss things you always want to discuss all the time in public, what kind of situation would that be?

You are in this business, you make sure thatâs what we can do, fine, work with it. Done. Thatâs it, make the best of it. Go about and go on the training ground.

Itâs not like that. You are interested in a player, you think about a player, you have to check if it is possible or not, itâs not possible. âNow we see. There are 12 midfielders we could sign, stuff like this yeah, fine. There are a lot of good players out there, honestly, yeah a lot of good players.

Football transfer rumours: Liverpool's top midfield target; Man Utd & Man City battle for Bastoni,"Apr 15, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/football-transfer-rumours-liverpool-midfield-man-utd-man-city-bastoni-15-4-2023,feed
Man Utd & Bayern Munich target Harry Kane to wait on Tottenham contract decision,"Apr 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-bayern-munich-target-harry-kane-to-wait-tottenham-contract-decision,"The England captain, who is a transfer target for both Manchester United and Bayern Munich, has just over a year remaining on his current deal and is yet to agree terms over an extension. 90min first revealed in May 2022 that Kane was willing to extend his stay at Spurs and he was very happy working under Antonio Conte, but the footballing landscape has changed a fair bit since then. Bayern Munich made their interest very public last summer to Conte's annoyance, while Tottenham have underperformed against expectations this season, leading to the Italian head coach's departure last month. It had been expected that Conte was not going to lead Spurs into the 2023/24 season, and 90min reported in March that the club's hierarchy were willing to involve Kane in the decision-making process behind hiring a new head coach as part of their attempts to convince him to stay. 90min now understands that Kane will reassess his stance once a permanent successor to Conte has been appointed, and while Tottenham have long been confident that their all-time record scorer will stay in north London, they will not push him for a decision until a new head coach is in the dugout. Burnley boss Vincent Kompany is being considered by Spurs, though ex-Bayern Munich manager Julian Nagelsmann and Brighton's Roberto De Zerbi are currently unconvinced by the prospect of taking over. During Tottenham's 2-1 win against Brighton last week, home fans loudly chanted the name of former manager Mauricio Pochettino, who would be interested in taking the job but would prefer to wait until the summer to decide his own future. Luis Enrique, who has held talks with Chelsea this month over their vacancy, is another target for Tottenham. feed Kane remains Bayern Munich's top striker target this summer, with the Bavarians' need for a natural centre forward emphasised in their recent Champions League defeat to Manchester City. While Kane would like to break Alan Shearer's all-time Premier League scoring record and is only 55 away from matching his total of 260, it remains to be seen whether he would jeopardise this with a move abroad. Manchester United also retain a firm interest in Kane, though are adamant they will not be dragged into a bidding war or a protracted transfer saga. They also believe that Spurs chairman Daniel Levy would make negotiations very difficult even if Kane were to dig his heels in. Levy famously drew the ire of Sir Alex Ferguson after selling them Dimitar Berbatov in 2008, with the former manager writing in his book: ""That whole experience was more painful than my hip replacement!"""
"Chelsea, Man Utd & Man City scout Monaco centre-back Axel Disasi","Apr 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-man-utd-man-city-scout-monaco-centre-back-axel-disasi,"The three Premier League giants are all expected to make changes in defence this summer and have been following a whole host of potential signings as they seek to whittle down their centre-back shortlists. Sources have confirmed that scouts from all three have been to watch Disasi in recent weeks. The 25-year-old, who made three appearances for France at the 2022 World Cup, has long been touted as a future star in Ligue 1 and has been an integral part of a Monaco side pushing for Champions League qualification. It is understood that Chelsea, City and United were all impressed by Disasi but their interest in the defender is only in its early stages and there are no guarantees any of the three clubs will take their tracking of him any further. There is also plenty of interest in Disasi from mainland Europe, with clubs from both Germany and Italy known to have watched the Frenchman recently. feed United hope to bolster at centre-back this summer but are aware of their need to part ways with one of their current crop of defenders first. 90min understands Harry Maguire is free to leave Old Trafford this summer. On the other side of Manchester, City are known to be chasing a deal for RB Leipzig defender Josko Gvardiol as they prepare for the departure of Aymeric Laporte, but may view Disasi as a cheaper alternative. Chelsea are also admirers of Gvardiol but are known to have looked at a number of centre-backs as they prepare for a summer in which the futures of Cesar Azpilicueta, Kalidou Koulibaly, Trevoh Chalobah and Marc Cucurella will all be up in the air. The Blues do have Levi Colwill returning from his loan with Brighton, and as 90min first revealed back in March, the current plan is to hand the academy graduate a new long-term contract and integrate him into the first team in an attempt to fend off interest from both City and Liverpool. Current blues director Laurence Stewart will be familiar with Disasi, having spent two-and-a-half years at Monaco before his move to Stamford Bridge."
Jurgen Klopp explains Liverpool's Jude Bellingham transfer decision,"Apr 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/jurgen-klopp-explains-liverpool-jude-bellingham-transfer-decision,"Liverpool have been working on a deal to sign the England international for years but have been forced to pull out of a race which is growing far too expensive for a side with limited resources and significant transfer needs elsewhere in the squad. Dortmund, if they do sell Bellingham this summer, are expected to demand a fee of at least â¬150m which, added to wages and agents fees, have seen Liverpool step aside, leaving Manchester City and Real Madrid as the likeliest destinations for the 19-year-old. Asked about Liverpool's decision, Klopp told Friday's press conference: ""There's nothing to say about it to be honest. If we don't speak about players we are signing or not signing, why would we now speak about this kind of speculation? Really nothing to say."" Klopp was pressed on the situation and later went on to compare Liverpool's pursuit of Bellingham to a child asking for a Ferrari for Christmas. feed ""It's not about Jude Bellingham,"" the boss continued. ""I never understood why we constantly talk about things we theoretically cannot have.  ""We cannot have six players in the summer where everybody is Â£100m, for example. You have to realise what you can do, and they you have to work with it. 'How much money do we have available?', and then you have to work with that. That's the job we have to do.  ""We are not children. Ask a five-year-old what they want for Christmas and they'll say a Ferrari. You wouldn't say that's a good idea. It's too expensive, and anyway you can't even drive it. That's how it is. If this kid is then unhappy his whole life because he cannot get a Ferrari, that would be a really sad life. It's just what can you do, and then you work with that. ""That's how I've always worked. What we need and what we want, we try absolutely everything to get it, but there are moments when you have to accept this or that is not possible for us, so we step aside and do different stuff."" Liverpool still intend to bolster in midfield but face an anxious wait over Chelsea's next round of contract talks with Mason Mount, who will be sold if he does not agree an extension this summer."
Chelsea confident they can sign Victor Osimhen without offer of Champions League football,"Apr 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-confident-they-can-sign-victor-osimhen-without-champions-league-football,"As revealed in February, Chelsea have made Osimhen their top striker target for 2023 after months of scouting the Nigeria international, and club officials are preparing what will likely be a club-record bid to take the 24-year-old to Stamford Bridge. Osimhen, who has 21 goals in 23 games for Serie A leaders Napoli this season, is also on the radars of Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United, who are all understood to have made contact with the striker's representatives. However, sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea believe they can outbid their rivals and convince Osimhen to move to London even without the promise of Champions League football next season. Moving to England's capital city is of interest to Osimhen but so too is the chance to follow in the footsteps of his childhood idol, Ivorian striker Didier Drogba, who is fondly remembered as one of Chelsea's all-time greatest players. feed Chelsea believe Osimhen would want to move to Stamford Bridge even without European football and the Blues are also prepared to blow other clubs out of the water with a huge club-record bid for the striker. Manchester United remain in contact with Osimhen's entourage but are currently focused on signing Tottenham striker Harry Kane alongside Bayern, who would not be prepared to pay the same sort of money as Chelsea in pursuit of the Nigerian. As for PSG, uncertainty over the future of manager Christophe Galtier means the French side's interest in Osimhen is nowhere near as advanced as that of Chelsea, who have been working behind the scenes for months. Sources close to Chelsea remain confident that they will be able to recruit Osimhen, whose arrival would be partly funded by a number of sales. The likes of Conor Gallagher, Kai Havertz, Christian Pulisic and Hakim Ziyech are among the most high-profile names who could leave Stamford Bridge this summer. Mason Mount is also a candidate to be sold this summer if he continues to decline a contract extension, but Chelsea hold renewed confidence about securing the midfielder's future ahead of a fresh round of talks. The Blues are keen to overhaul their struggling forward line and have already wrapped up a deal for RB Leipzig's Christopher Nkunku, but the Frenchman is seen as a better fit for the position behind a central striker and so Chelsea want to team him up with Osimhen."
Barcelona close to Ilkay Gundogan deal as Man City contract nears expiry,"Apr 14, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-close-ilkay-gundogan-deal-man-city-contract-nears-expiry,"City have not given up hope that the 32-year-old will extend his stay at the reigning Premier League champions, but sources have confirmed to 90min that the club will not look to force the issue with Gundogan because of his outstanding service over the years. Gundogan's representatives have been talking to Barcelona for a number of months, while 90min reported in October on Bayern Munich's longstanding interest in the German, who previously played for their Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund. Paris Saint-Germain have also been in contact with his team. City manager Pep Guardiola acknowledged in February that Gundogan ""can do whatever he wants"" after scoring twice on the final day of the 2021/22 Premier League season - goals that earned the Citizens a breathtaking, title-winning three points against Aston Villa. The Spaniard also said that Gundogan ""has the paradise already"" and that ""he knows exactly my opinion about him"", strongly hinting that he'd like his captain to remain at the club. But 90min understands that although further talks with Barcelona have not yet yielded a formal agreement, the Catalan giants are closing in on a deal for Gundogan. feed A move to Camp Nou this summer would end Gundogan's seven-year association with Manchester City, which has seen him win four Premier League titles and seven domestic cup competitions. He has played close to 300 games in all competitions for the club, scoring some momentous goals over the years while playing as a box-to-box midfielder. Gundogan's potential arrival at Barcelona would boost the depth of Xavi's soon-to-be crowned La Liga champions, with the club looking to reposition themselves as a force in the Champions League after back-to-back early exits in the competition. Barcelona's financial troubles are well documented, so the opportunity to sign a player of Gundogan's calibre on a free transfer is inevitably one that appeals - the club concluded similar deals for Franck Kessie, Andreas Christensen and Marcos Alonso for the same reasons over the course of this season. The Catalan giants also hope to persuade Lionel Messi to complete a fairytale return to the club, two years after he departed for Paris Saint-Germain because of the same financial issues that continue to plague the club."

That goalscoring feat has led to many Arsenal fans calling for the 21-year-old's return to the Emirates Stadium in the summer to become a key player for Mikel Arteta's side.  Sources have told 90min Balogun is due to hold talks about his future with the Gunners this summer, and he intends to make it clear to the club that if he is not guaranteed first-team opportunities, he will be keen to leave. Another loan move, while Arsenal would be keen, has been ruled out by the striker's representatives so a permanent move is the most likely outcome.  feed RB Leipzig, Eintracht Frankfurt, Union Berlin, Marseille, Nice, Lyon, Villarreal and Sevilla are all interested in the forward's services, with Leizpig seeing Balogun as a potential replacement for the Chelsea-bound Christopher Nkunku.  90min understands there is plenty of interest from English clubs too, as Brentford, Leicester City, Wolves, Everton and Crystal Palace are all keeping tabs on Balogun, although the rumoured asking price of Â£30m may prove to be a sticking point for many.  All of the aforementioned Premier League clubs are in dire need of a new striker in the summer, particularly Brentford who may be forced to be without star man Ivan Toney for a lengthy period due to the betting charges levied against him.

Chelsea hold renewed confidence over extending contract of Liverpool target Mason Mount,"Apr 13, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-hold-renewed-confidence-contract-liverpool-target-mason-mount,"Mount is approaching the final 12 months of his current deal and has been warned that he will be sold this summer if he continues to reject the chance to extend, with Liverpool leading a number of Premier League sides in pursuing his signature.

Chelsea are on the hunt for a new manager to replace the recently departed Graham Potter and 90min understands that the Blues, who have always remained confident about their chances of retaining Mount, believe their new plans are impressive enough to convince the academy graduate to stay. Bosses with experience at the highest level, including Julian Nagelsmann, Luis Enrique and Mauricio Pochettino, are all under consideration as part of an intense recruitment process which Chelsea's decision-makers are determined to get right, and there is a renewed confidence that Mount will share that ambition and positivity. feed Indeed, Mount is understood to be feeling more confident about the future of the club thanks to Chelsea's managerial plans. An agreement remains some way away but Chelsea still believe they can convince Mount to stay and recently hinted at a willingness to agree to a shorter contract, having tied left-back Ben Chilwell down to a four-year deal instead of the usual six, seven or even eight years which have been handed out to various players across the season. Chelsea's renewed optimism comes as another blow to suitors Liverpool, who have identified Mount as a top midfield target after accepting defeat in the race to sign Borussia Dortmund midfielder Jude Bellingham. Liverpool lodged their interest with Mount's representatives early on amid fears that a change in Chelsea's direction could alter their stance in negotiations with the 24-year-old, and Jurgen Klopp's side will now face a nervous wait to see whether Chelsea can finally get an agreement over the line."

Barcelona prepare world record offer for Lyon's Ada Hegerberg,"Apr 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/barcelona-prepare-world-record-offer-lyon-ada-hegerberg,"Hegerberg, who has spent nine seasons with OL and has cemented her status as one of the game's greatest ever players. Spanish outlet Marca report that she is now BarÃ§a's number-one target this summer. Barcelona are said to be keen to wrap up a deal before the start of the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, which kicks off on 20 July. With 238 goals in 213 games for Lyon, Hegerberg is considered one of the most complete strikers in the world, and the BarÃ§a board believe that she possesses skills that the club's current forwards don't have. If Barcelona are successful, the transfer would exceed the Â£352,000 they paid to Manchester City for England midfielder Keira Walsh last summer. The club's president Joan Laporta reportedly met with Hegerberg during the previous Ballon d'Or ceremony, where the OL player finished seventh. She had previously won the inaugural award in 2018. Barcelona are on the verge of completing a historic season - they have won all 24 of their Liga F games thus far and are through to the semi-finals of the Champions League."
Robert Lewandowski hopes for Lionel Messi's return to Barcelona,"Apr 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/robert-lewandowski-hopes-for-lionel-messi-return-to-barcelona,"The legendary Argentine is unlikely to extend his contract at Paris Saint-Germain, sources have confirmed to 90min, and there's hope within Barcelona's hierarchy that a sensational return to Catalonia can be agreed. Messi's father, Jorge, has met with Barcelona officials over the last few weeks to discuss a potential return, with president Joan Laporta making it clear that Messi's homecoming would be welcomed with open arms. Contact has also been made by Saudi Arabian outfit Al-Hilal, the city rivals of Cristiano Ronaldo's Al Nassr, but the lucrative contract on offer to Messi is unlikely to persuade him and his family that a return to Barcelona isn't in his best interests. ""If he comes back to Barcelona, it will not only be for the fans but for the players something amazing because his place is here in Barcelona,"" Lewandowski said, in quotes relayed by Spanish publication Sport. feed ""I don't know what's going on... I hope that next season we can play together because I know that Leo is the guy who can do [create] something from nothing, and of course, we need those kinds of players, for sure. ""For me, I say that Lionel Messi always belongs to Barcelona,"" he continued.  Barcelona still need to shave more than â¬150m off their annual spending to comply with La Liga's financial regulations, with the club currently unable to register a new contract for teenage prodigy Gavi. In better news, Barcelona are well clear of rivals Real Madrid at the top of La Liga. Xavi's side are 13 point ahead of Carlo Ancelotti's Blancos, with their domestic success glossing over what was another disappointing campaign in Europe."
"Man Utd, Liverpool & Arsenal monitoring Ryan Gravenberch situation at Bayern","Apr 12, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-liverpool-arsenal-monitoring-ryan-gravenberch-situation-at-bayern,"The Dutch midfielder signed for Bayern last summer from Ajax, but has found his first season in Bavaria difficult - playing only 323 minutes to date in their Bundesliga campaign. He was left on the bench for the entirety of Bayern's 3-0 Champions League defeat to Manchester City on Tuesday. Gravenberch is understood to have never won over now former manager Julian Nagelsmann, and is at the moment unclear how he fits into the plans of new Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel. Leon Goretzka and Joshua Kimmich are Bayern's first choice players in central midfield and the club are also set to sign Konrad Laimer from RB Leipzig on a free transfer, making competition even greater. Gravenberch is looking for a path to regular first team football and is set to analyse his chances of a long-term role at Bayern in the final weeks of the season. All three Premier League clubs are looking to upgrade their options in midfield, with different profiles of player being considered by each. feed United are looking for a ball-playing number eight, and have had Frenkie de Jong of Barcelona in mind since Erik ten Hag's arrival. 90min also reported in recent weeks of exploratory interest in Mateo Kovacic, who is out of contract with Chelsea in 2024. Orkan Kokcu of Feyenoord has also been watched of late. Ten Hag has worked with Gravenberch before at Ajax, and introduced him to the club's first team. Liverpool meanwhile are looking sign up to three midfielders over the summer, and have withdrawn from the race to sign number one target Jude Bellingham due to prohibitive cost. They instead prefer to spread their summer budget over multiple, cheaper options. Chelsea's Mason Mount has also been of strong interest to Jurgen Klopp, while other targets are being considered from Premier League clubs - Matheus Nunes, Ruben Neves, Moises Caicedo and Alexis Mac Allister among them. Gravenberch is also being considered by Klopp having been a previous Liverpool target and a relatively cheap acquisition should Bayern decide to cash in. Fiorentina's Sofyan Amrabat is also among Liverpool's targets. Liverpool's desire to recruit so many players for one area of the pitch inevitably means several players are profiled and analysed. Arsenal meanwhile tried to sign Caicedo in January, only to be put off by Brighton's lofty valuation of the Ecuadorian midfielder. Youri Tielemans of Leicester City, out of contract at the end of the season, has also been considered by the Gunners and may become an option. The three clubs have also been following West Ham's Declan Rice for some time, along with Premier League leaders Manchester City and boyhood club Chelsea.

Liverpool back away from summer deal for Jude Bellingham,"Apr 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-back-away-summer-deal-jude-bellingham,"Bellingham has long been Liverpoolâs top transfer target, but a deal to get him this summer appears beyond what they were willing to do given Borussia Dortmund's lofty asking price for the England midfielder. 90min confirmed earlier this year that Dortmund would be willing to sell, but the price of a deal would be â¬150m - beyond their current club-record sale of â¬144m which they received for Ousmane Dembele in 2017. Liverpool, Real Madrid and Manchester City have all put what they consider to be compelling cases to Bellingham in the past few months. Bellingham is due to speak to Dortmund in April to discuss his future which, as 90min revealed earlier this season, includes the option of staying with the club for another year. feed Dortmund, who have Bellingham underÂ contract until 2025, are willing to make him the highest paid player in their history and in return for that they would insert a release clause allowing him to leave for way below his market value - a similar situation which saw Erling Haaland stay before joining Manchester City last summer. Bellingham is due to make his decision but as it stands, if he was to leave this summer it would be a straight choice between Real and City. Both sides are willing to sanction a deal which would be one of the largest deals in football history.  Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea have both contacted Bellinghamâs representatives too, and while they would be able to match any offer, 90min understands that neither are being considered as realistic landing spots at this time.Â  Should Bellingham decide to stay at Dortmund for another year and sign a new deal with a release clause, 90min has been told that ""all bets would be off"" for 2024. The race would again likely include Liverpool and possibly Manchester United too, who have been in the background throughout this saga and have kept tabs on the situation."

Representatives from Tottenham were majorly impressed by Goncalves and they have continued to follow his development. Aston Villa, Liverpool and Newcastle United have all watched Goncalves this season, but Spurs are believed to be the club most interested in signing him. feed The Portugal international began his professional career at Wolves but played just once for the senior side and was sold to Familicao in 2019. Goncalves moved to Sporting in the summer of 2020 in-part as a replacement to Bruno Fernandes, who was courted by Spurs before joining Manchester United in January of that year. His first season in Lisbon proved successful, scoring 23 goals in 32 games as Sporting won their first league title in 19 years. He has maintained an impressive goal return in the following two seasons - Goncalves has scored 56 goals and laid on 31 assists in 120 games for Sporting - though was notably overlooked by Fernando Santos for Portugal's 2022 FIFA World Cup squad. Goncalves is capable of playing on either wing, as a number ten or in central midfield, which would particularly appeal to Tottenham as they need to upgrade in all of these areas. 90min recently reported that Spurs are among the frontrunners in the race to sign James Maddison from Leicester City this summer."
Udinese reach agreement to sign Jordan Zemura from Bournemouth,"Apr 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/udinese-reach-agreement-jordan-zemura-bournemouth,"The Zimbabwe international has been coveted by several other Premier League clubs ahead of the expiration of his deal at the Vitality Stadium. 90min has previously reported that the likes of Crystal Palace and West Ham United had showed significant interest in Zemura, while others such as Aston Villa, Leeds United and Newcastle United are admirers. But sources have now told 90min that Serie A side Udinese are set to win the race for Zemura instead. The 23-year-old made his name at Bournemouth during their promotion-winning 2021/22 season, scoring three goals in 33 Championship games as the Cherries finished second. feed Zemura has played 22 times in all competitions for Bournemouth this term but has been left out of the matchday squad for their last five games and has since been demoted to their development squad. Udinese view Zemura as a long-term replacement for 20-year-old Destiny Udogie, whose loan from Tottenham expires this summer. Spurs beat Brighton to the signing of Udogie last year, agreeing to loan him back to Udinese for the 2022/23 season. 90min understands that Spurs have been particularly impressed with Udogie's progress this year, while he made his first visit to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium back in February, witnessing a 2-0 win against West Ham."

The former La Liga heavyweights currently sit on the brink of relegation, and are two points adrift of Real Valladolid in 17th-place in the table heading into the final 10 games of the season.  Despite their league form, the 22-year-old has put in some solid performances since arriving in 2021 on an initial loan deal which was made permament in the summer of 2022.  These performances have seen Mamardashvili attract interest from a number of clubs, particularly in the Premier League. Sources have confirmed to 90min that the goalkeeper's representatives were in England last week to speak to Chelsea, Tottenham, Manchester United and Leicester, with the latter notably retaining the strongest interest in the player.  feed Atletico Madrid, Monaco and AC Milan all also retain an interest in the goalkeeper, but all interest is dependent upon what happens with each clubs' current number one. Atleti could be set to move on from Jan Oblak this summer, Monaco are set to lose Alexander Nubel back to Bayern Munich at the end of his loan deal, and Milan may need a new goalkeeper if Mike Maignan decides to leave. The Georgian international is keen to leave Valencia this summer and 90min understands that the club will not stand in the player's way.  Valencia are touted to want Â£30m for Mamardashvili, but may ask for more from a La Liga club. "
Leeds ordered to pay Jean-Kevin Augustin huge compensation fee,"Apr 11, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/leeds-ordered-pay-jean-kevin-augustin-huge-compensation-fee,"The 25-year-old, who now plays for Swiss giants Basel, joined the Whites on loan from RB Leipzig in January 2020, in a deal that included an obligation to buy.

""There is a mutual willingness to renew and it is a good foundation. There are particular complexities, but we are facing them with confidence in the hope of finding a solution by the end of the season,"" he told Sky Italia. While negotiations are ongoing, Massara stated there are still some hurdles to overcome. He added: ""Making percentages is a bit difficult; either we do it or we don't, it's always 50-50.

In terms of goalscoring, there's no genius coach that can explain that to a point, you can set up a team. ""All I will be here is to work with repetition and speak to the players. Fortunately it was a big part of my game. It's just a case of trying to direct them in the right way."""
Liverpool & Tottenham register interest in James Maddison,"Apr 6, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/liverpool-tottenham-register-interest-in-james-maddison,"The 26-year-old has returned to peak form this season despite Leicester City's struggles in their fight to stave off relegation, contributing nine goals and six assists in 21 Premier League games thus far. Maddison's performances earned him a place in the England squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and he made his first start for the Three Lions in their 2-0 win against Ukraine last month. Regardless of their attempts to beat the drop, Leicester have long accepted that they will have to part ways with Maddison after he turned down several offers of a new contract. 90min understands that the Foxes would be open to sale for a fee of at least Â£50m come the end of the season. feed Liverpool and Spurs have both reached out to Maddison's camp to confirm their interest in a summer deal. 90min reported last month that the Reds are also fond of England colleague Mason Mount. Newcastle United have a long-standing admiration of Maddison too and had been well ahead in the race to sign him, though now face a tougher battle to secure his signature. The Magpies are hoping that the potential lure of UEFA Champions League football - something Liverpool and Tottenham are currently less likely to be able to offer - will help their case. Maddison is one of the Premier League's leading creative midfielders and his talents are wasted in a relegation battle. It's no surprise that these three clubs in particular - Liverpool, Newcastle and Tottenham - are interested in signing him as they are all in need of such a profile. His ability to play as a number ten or come in from wide is appealing, and as long as the trio stump up the cash Leicester ask for, Maddison could have his pick of the clubs. As mentioned, Newcastle look a safer bet than Liverpool or Tottenham to reach next season's Champions League. The Magpies are on an upward trajectory and jumping aboard that ship would make sense given the two other clubs' need to rebuild. But what Newcastle lack is a proven consistency at this level - how will they fare balancing European football with a domestic campaign with a manager as unproven as Eddie Howe on these stages? Liverpool and Spurs are in ruts right now, but they a proven track record of pulling themselves back from the brink even when it looks like they're in an inescapable crisis. Maddison could see himself as the man to ignite another comeback."

Juventus & Napoli eye Rasmus Hojlund amid Dusan Vlahovic & Victor Osimhen exit rumours,"Apr 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/juventus-napoli-rasmus-hojlund-dusan-vlahovic-victor-osimhen-exit-rumours,"Hojlund has been one of the breakout stars of the 2022/23 Serie A season, becoming a key player for the Bergamo club by bagging an impressive seven goals in just 14 starts. The 20-year-old has also caught the eye with his performances for the Danish national team too, scoring five goals in just two Euro 2026 qualifiers already. The forward's form has, as expected, alerted some of the biggest clubs in Europe. 90min understands that two such clubs are Italian giants Juventus and Napoli.  Both clubs see Hojlund as a contingency plan if either of their current number nines leave this summer. Sources told 90min back in January that Juve's Vlahovic had been offered to a number of top clubs, including Manchester United, following the club's 15 point deduction due to financial mismanagement.  feed Said points deduction has made it improbable that Juve will qualify for the UEFA Champions League next season, a competition Vlahovic has ambitions of playing in.  Napoli are eying a move for Hojlund due to Chelsea making Victor Osimhen their 'top target' ahead of the summer window. Alarm bells were likely sounded at Stadio Diego Armando Maradona recently too when the striker confirmed that it is his 'dream' to play in the Premier League.   As well as the competition between one another, Juventus and Napoli could also face some from abroad too. 90min understands that Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United all sent scouts to watch Hojlund's Denmark debut - a game in which the striker scored a hat-trick against Finland - while Everton, Leicester City, Crystal Palace, West Ham, Bayern Munich and Marseille have all watched the player in recent months too."
Robert Lewandowski reveals he wanted to join Man Utd ,"Apr 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/robert-lewandowski-reveals-he-wanted-to-join-man-utd,"Lewandowski had started rising through the Polish lower leagues from the age of 16, landing with top flight Lech Poznan in 2008 and scored 41 times in 82 appearances across all competitions. That paved the way for a move to Germany and Borussia Dortmund, with the young striker a regular in Kloppâs side that won the 2010/11 Bundesliga title. Although Lewandowski wasnât a prolific goalscorer at that stage of his career like he has since become, it appears that Fergie and United quickly saw his enormous potential. It was during Dortmundâs pre-season and he was 22 at the time, which places it around July 2011, when United were in need of a fresh injection up front and would sign Robin van Persie to spearhead their next Premier League title charge the following year. âI remember the moment exactly,â Lewandowski has now recalled in an interview with Sport Bild. âWe had a friendly with Dortmund in preparation, I think against Bochum. I was subbed at half-time. I looked at my mobile phone in the dressing room. There was a text message with the sender +44. Ferguson had tried to call me and then sent me a message. He wanted to talk to me. manual âI was still in the dressing room, I took a shower and called him back, in a quiet corner. My English wasnât as good as it is today. He has a strong Scottish accent. I was so focused on understanding what he meant! Alex Ferguson tried to be considerate, spoke slowly. âI was 22-years-old, it was a special moment. I spoke to Aki Watzke and Jurgen Klopp in the camp. I wanted to go to Man United! But they said: âNo chance, Robert. We need you. You have to stayâ.â Stay was exactly what he did do, with Lewandowski going onto score 30 goals in all competitions the next season for the first time in his career as Dortmund retained their title. A year later, he fired the club to the Champions League final, before a free transfer to Bayern Munich in 2014. In Bavaria, he seemed to get better with age and netted an astonishing 344 times in 375 games. Now, the veteran star is at Barcelona and has shown no signs of slowing down, despite playing in a new country for the first time in 12 years â 27 goals in 34 games tells its own story. But when Fergie called all those years ago, it wasnât actually the first time that an English club had made an attempt to buy Lewandowski. A volcanic ash cloud grounding flights in Europe was partly responsible for scuppering Blackburnâs chance to sign him direct from Poznan before Dortmund. A price tag of up to â¬4m was also an issue for the former Premier League champions, who were relegated in 2012 and havenât returned to the top flight since. A couple of months after Blackburn had been denied their meeting with Lewandowski, Dortmund signed him for â¬4.5m. âI think about it every time I see him play,â former Rovers manager Sam Allardyce remarked three years later. ""I think they wanted â¬3m or â¬4m, but we were particularly strapped financially at the time at Blackburn. I watched him play, but I didn't get the chance to meet him. I think his agent said he couldn't come over because of the ash cloud. ""There were a lot of people looking at him at that time as well, but we had the edge over everyone else because of the attraction of the Premier League. He could have used us as a stepping stone but it didn't happen."""
PSG accept Lionel Messi unlikely to extend contract | Further Barcelona talks planned,"Apr 5, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/psg-accept-lionel-messi-unlikely-to-extend-contract-barcelona-talks-planned,"Messi's contract with PSG expires in the summer and talks have been ongoing throughout the year over a new deal. However, sources have told 90min that PSG have now accepted that it is unlikely that 35-year-old Messi, who won the World Cup with Argentina at the back end of last year, will stay at Parc des Princes beyond this season. That further opens the door to a return to Barcelona, after 90min recently revealed that a reunion was becoming a more likely outcome. Barcelona have been very open with their interest in bringing Messi back to Catalonia - Barca vice-president Rafa Yuste admitted last week that the club are 'in contact' with the forward and his entourage. feed ""Leo and his family know the affection I have for them,"" he said toÂ SPORT. ""I participated in the negotiations that unfortunately did not lead to success. ""I'm gutted that Leo could not continue at out club. If you talk about La Masia, you talk about Messi. Of course, I would love to see him come back, for what it could represent at a sporting, social and economic level. and I think the fans too because beautiful stories in life have to have a happy ending. And we are in love with Messi and I think Messi is in love with BarÃ§a and the city of Barcelona. We are in contact with them, yes."" Sources have confirmed to 90min that Jorge Messi will fly to Barcelona within the next week to continue discussing a free transfer back to Camp Nou two years after his 21-year association with the club came to an emotional and dramatic end. Messi is still being courted by MLS side Inter Miami and clubs in Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, with lucrative offers in the works to try and tempt him to leave Europe."

Santiago Gimenez's recent form attracts several European giants,"Apr 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/santiago-gimenez-s-recent-form-attracts-several-european-giants-01gx6hcq21vs,"In England, Leicester, Aston Villa, Brentford, Brighton and Crystal Palace stand among those keeping a close eye on Gimenez in the last couple of weeks, sources close to 90min can confirm. Clubs in France, Italy and Germany remain interested as well, specifically Lille, Frankfurt and Napoli. Gimenez adjusted quickly to the Dutch league, scoring 21 goals so far this season in all competitions. But it's his recent form - eight goals in his last 10 appearances and scoring in six consecutive Eredivisie away games - that has attracted European giants.Â  The consensus between certain teams hint that Gimenez would benefit from another year in the Eredivisie, sources add. But the fast-paced nature of the transfer market may impulse a potential move. Gimenez first joined Feyenoord in July 2022, signing a four-year contract to complete the transfer from Liga MXâs Cruz Azul. He has flourished under current manager Arne Slot, working through serving as an unused substitute to a vital component of the starting 11. feed His contributions have propelled Feyenoord to top of the Eredivisie table, edging out giants PSV and Ajax, and to the semifinals of the KNVB Cup.Â  Before moving abroad, Gimenez served as a staple for Cruz Azul. He first kicked off in 2017, debuting on August 30 in a 2-1 victory over Tigres UANL, prior to recording 21 goals in 105 appearances to lift the 2021 League trophy and 2022 Campeon de Campeones Cup.Â  His club success has also propelled Gimenez to the Mexican national team, earning nine appearances. The striker most recently featured in El Triâs 2-0 Concacaf Nations League victory over Suriname on March 23.Â "
Wolves ready to make audacious offer for Real Madrid star,"Apr 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/wolves-ready-to-make-audacious-offer-for-real-madrid-star,"The 26-year-old is out of contract this summer and is free to negotiate terms with interested parties over a potential move. Champions League holders Real, who will take on Chelsea in the quarter-finals of this year's edition, are in talks with Ceballos about extending his contract, but although the Spaniard is happy in Madrid and the club are confident about renewing, there are ongoing concerns about his playing time at the Bernabeu. Indeed, Real Madrid have a swathe of quality options in midfield - Toni Kroos, Luka Modric, Aurelien Tchouameni and Eduardo Camavinga to name just four - and they have a strong interest in signing Jude Bellingham from Borussia Dortmund. Ceballos has enjoyed a run in the first team of late, putting in a number of impressive performances, but he has never started more than 13 La Liga games in a season for Real since arriving from Real Betis in 2017. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Ceballos is again attracting interest from England, this time in the form of Wolves, who are looking to bolster their central midfield options and are managed by former Real Madrid boss Julen Lopetegui. feed Ceballos is known to be a player that Lopetegui admires - they spent a couple of months together during the latter's brief stint in the Spanish capital - and he could help fill the potential voids left by Ruben Neves and Matheus Nunes in midfield. The Portuguese pair are generating serious interest from elsewhere and could be allowed to leave Molineux so that Wolves can reinvest. 90min understands that Wolves are readying an approach for Ceballos, but are acutely aware that he'll need persuading to leave Real Madrid for a side who are still fighting to preserve their Premier League status - any move will obviously be dependant on Wolves achieving that goal. Atletico Madrid are also interested in signing Ceballos, while sources have confirmed that Real Betis would like to re-sign him. Eintracht Frankfurt and RB Leipzig are among his admirers in Germany, along with Ligue 1 duo Marseille and Monaco, and Serie A trio Juventus, Napoli and AC Milan are also thought to be keeping tabs on his situation."
"Man City, Man Utd & Real Madrid show interest in Benjamin Pavard","Apr 4, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/man-city-man-utd-real-madrid-show-interest-benjamin-pavard,"Pavard has been considered one of Europeâs most talented full-backâs for a number of seasons, but his long-term future at Bayern is uncertain and he does have options away from Bavaria. City, United and Real are all looking at bolstering their options at right back in the coming months and Pavard has emerged as a very attractive option. Sources have told 90min that all three clubs are well aware of the state of play with Pavard, and have asked to be kept informed about his situation. Pavard has just over a year left on his current deal and Bayern are keen to open talks over an extension. But the Frenchman and hisÂ representatives have told the Bundesliga giants that they will wait until the summer before deciding what to do next, which is something the player confirmed publicly this week. ""There are currently no talks with the club, we're focused on our season goals,â Pavard said.Â ""I'm just trying to play my best football and win trophies. We'll see this summer.â Bayern recently dismissed Julian Nagelsmann as manager, which shocked Pavard and many of his teammates, but new boss Thomas Tuchel has wastedÂ little time in confirming his admiration for the 27-year-old. ""I don't want to get involved in negotiations. He's an underrated player,â Tuchel said. ""He can adapt at an extremely high level, defends with big discipline. He's a top team player. He immediately got my trust and justified it. That should be a clear statement.â feed Cityâs interest in Pavard is fascinating given they have one of their ownÂ full-back options at Bayern - Portugal international Joao Cancelo. He departed the Etihad in January on a loan deal with an option to buy this summer, but it remains to be seen whether that clause will be activated or not. Tuchel is a fan of Cancelo's though, and has already spoken favourably of his ability to play on both sides of defence. ""I love Joao, I've had to play against him many times,"" the German remarked. ""He has the absolute highest quality, left foot, right foot, passing. He's a different type of player than Benji Pavard. He can also play on the left in the back four."" City are obviously already in contact with Bayern about Cancelo, but United and Real can't be ruled out of the Pavard equation as they step up their own efforts to sign a new right-back. Erik ten Hag has overseen somewhat of a resurgence at United, despite some indifferent results away from home, and is looking to move on from Aaron Wan-Bissaka this summer. The Red Devils have been considering options for the last six months, with Ajaxâs Jurrien Timber, Bayer Leverkusenâs Jeremie Frimpong and Interâs Denzel Dumfries among those to have been considered, but Pavard is very much on the club's radar. Likewise, Real are also in contention for Pavard - should he decide to leave the Allianz this summer - as they look to upgrade on Spanish veteran Dani Carvajal."

Chelsea strike deal to sign Independiente del Valle wonderkid Kendry Paez,"Apr 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/chelsea-strike-deal-to-sign-independiente-del-valle-wonderkid-kendry-paez,"Paez is seen as one of South America's most exciting youngsters and is already a regular feature for the senior side, even scoring on his debut earlier this year. Clubs from across Europe have been following Paez with a view to signing him once he turns 18 in 2025, but Chelsea have moved aggressively to fend off competition by agreeing a deal which 90min understands could be worth up to â¬20m if all bonuses are met - a clear record for a player of his age. IDV general manager Santiago Morales recently revealed that the club were close to agreeing a deal to sell Paez to an unnamed club and sources have now confirmed that Chelsea have put the finishing touches on another huge youth transfer. manual Born in 2007, Paez is the latest sensation to come through the academy at Independiente del Valle. The young midfielder has shone at youth level for club and country, impressing with five assists and one goal in his first five appearances for Ecuador's Under-17 side, and scouts from across the globe have been thoroughly excited by what they have seen from the teenager. Paez is primarily an attacking midfielder but has featured regularly on the right wing. Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital have bought into Chelsea's 'Vision 2030' plan, spending huge sums of money on young talents in an attempt to build an elite first-team squad by the time 2030 arrives. Gabriel Slonina, Carney Chukwuemeka and Cesar Casadei have all been signed for huge fees with a view to making an impact on the senior team down the line, and Paez is another example of the sort of player Chelsea are looking to sign."

Newcastle among Premier League clubs keen on Man City defensive starlet,"Apr 3, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/newcastle-among-premier-league-clubs-keen-man-city-defensive-starlet,"The 21-year-old central defender is currently on loan at Championship promotion favourites Burnley, and has played a starring role for Vincent Kompany's side. Harwood-Bellis is highly rated at City, and with his current contract due to expire next summer, plans are afoot to hold extension talks at the end of the season. However, sources have told 90min that although the Stockport-born stopper would like to make the grade at the Etihad Stadium, he recognises he is some way down the pecking order. Indeed, Harwood-Bellis is yet to play for City in the Premier League, though he has made a handful of cup appearances for the club. The England Under-21 international has also chalked up over 100 games at senior level thanks to loan spells with Blackburn, Anderlecht, Stoke and now Burnley. feed 90min understands that Burnley are hoping to bring Harwood-Bellis back to the club next season, and City legend Kompany is hopeful that his former employers will sanction a deal - whether it be another loan or a permanent deal. However, Kompany is not alone in his admiration of Harwood-Bellis, who City would consider selling if he does not agree a new contract, and sources have confirmed to 90min that Newcastle are considering making a summer move. Signing at least one new central defender is on Eddie Howe's summer wish list. Fabian Schar has performed brilliantly next to Sven Botman at the heart of the Newcastle defence, but the Magpies want to bolster their options beyond the likes of Jamaal Lascelles, who could leave this summer, and Dan Burn, who has spent most of the season at full-back. That means at least one new addition in the heart of Newcastle's defence, and Harwood-Bellis is very much on the club's radar. Any potential move, however, could be complicated by interest from the likes of West Ham, Fulham and Brentford."

Wayne Rooney describes similarities between Marcus Rashford & Harry Kane,"Apr 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/wayne-rooney-describes-similarities-marcus-rashford-harry-kane,"Rashford is enjoying his best season in a United shirt to date, already racking up 27 goals in 44 games across all competitions and leading them to Carabao Cup glory. He has, however, had to shoulder the majority of the Red Devils' scoring load - Bruno Fernandes (10) is the only other player in the squad to have reached double figures for goals this term. 90min understands that a new centre forward is on United's wishlist for the summer transfer window, with Kane - now England and Tottenham's all-time leading scorer - a target. manual In his column for The Times, D.C. United manager Rooney praised Rashford's resilience and played up similarities to Kane. ""If you think back to only a year ago, Marcus was in and out of the starting XI, hardly scoring, playing in different positions and the smile I remembered from that lovely kid who came through the ranks and broke into our team when I was captain was gone,"" Rooney wrote. ""Now, he looks a totally different player and to be in a great place off the pitch as well. You can see he is enjoying his football and is more positive in his running. He penetrates with his runs off the ball and commits defenders when heâs on the ball - doing everything I wrote about wanting to see from him. ""He has always been a good finisher but, in front of goal, you can see the improvement that comes from confidence. He is taking his chances now without a secondâs thought whereas before he was overthinking and taking that extra second, then not being as decisive with his finish as he should be. ""He reminds me of Harry Kane in how he puts the ball in the net. You almost never see Harry score a goal where he caresses it into the corner - every finish is hit hard and goes in with pace. Marcus is quite similar. When he gets in front of goal he puts his foot through it. ""What he and Harry do is actually a much harder skill than, say, stroking it home like Thierry Henry used to do. Itâs harder because just like when you hit a golf shot and the harder you swing the less accurate you tend to be, you risk things going wrong. However when you develop the ability to get those finishes on target repeatedly, you become very hard to stop - like Harry throughout his career and Marcus recently."""
How much Premier League clubs paid to agents,"Apr 2, 2023",https://www.90min.com/posts/how-much-premier-league-clubs-paid-to-agents,"The gargantuan fees paid by Premier League clubs to agents and intermediaries has increased in each of the last seven years. However, the unrelenting uptick may have reached its apex after FIFA announced in January that the commissions agents receive for player transfer fees would be capped going forward. However, those restrictions - which the world's most prominent representatives are unsurprisingly contesting - were not drafted early enough to prevent England's top-flight clubs from coughing up more than Â£300m combined on agents' fees (almost double the figure from 2016, Â£174m). Here's the breakdown of how much each Premier League team had to fork out across the summer and winter windows of the 2022/23 season. Club (Â£) Net total paid to Agents/Intermediaries Man City 51,563,571 Chelsea 43,160,072 Liverpool 33,691,782 Man Utd 24,726,374 Arsenal 16,749,072 Tottenham 16,137,103 Aston Villa 15,623,203 Leeds 15,310,814 Everton 13,542,845 West Ham 12,030,438 Newcastle 10,784,029 Leicester 10,282,967 Crystal Palace 9,796,296 Fulham 8,758,854 Brighton 8,583,317 Southampton 6,319,675 Wolves 6,186,765 Brentford 5,560,192 Bournemouth 5,058,871 Nottingham Forest 4,353,186 Data from the English Football Association Manchester City top the chart with more than Â£51m going to various intermediaries this season. The reigning Premier League champions spent less on transfers than Wolverhampton Wanderers but the acquisition of Erling Haaland - for a paltry sum of Â£51.2m to Borussia Dortmund - came under the conditions of a hefty bonus for the striker's representatives, with Rafaela Pimenta reportedly earning Â£34m from the deal.  Roughly speaking, for every Â£2.50 City spent on player fees this season, they have paid agents Â£1.00 - the highest ratio in the Premier League. Chelsea have spent around 2.5 times more on transfer fees in this time period than any other club, yet the new hierarchy in west London has managed to limit the figures for agents to Â£43m. Manchester United, the only team other than Chelsea to exceed Â£200m in this season's summer and winter windows, have spent almost half as much as the Blues on agents (Â£24m). Liverpool have only signed five senior players this season yet rank third for fees paid to agents among England's top flight. The sizeable sums which were required to lure Darwin Nunez (Â£64m) and Cody Gakpo (Â£40m) to Anfield likely account for much of this expenditure. Arsenal and Tottenham, the rest of the so-called 'Big Six', round out the leading half-dozen agent feeders with Aston Villa next on the list. The Villans were keen to strengthen the squad for Steven Gerrard in the summer and brought in Jhon Duran along with Alex Moreno after Unai Emery replaced the former Liverpool midfielder. At the other end of the spectrum, Nottingham Forest broke records by acquiring as many as 30 players. The promoted outfit sacked two senior members of the recruitment team that oversaw such an overhaul in October but the individual that negotiated the finances of each deal warrants plenty of praise; despite their free-wheeling approach, Forest paid agents less than any other Premier League team. Fellow promoted side Bournemouth limited their outlay on representatives to a little over Â£5m while infamously canny operators Brentford round out the thriftiest three teams in the Premier League with just Â£5.5m to the world's agents."
