Transcript: 
Have you ever wondered what would happen if you actually sat down with missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints? 
Well, the answer depends on you. What do you want to talk about? 
Maybe you want a closer relationship with God, or maybe you’re really interested in the teachings of Jesus Christ. 
Or maybe you’re just curious about our beliefs. 
Whatever the reason, here’s what to expect. 
After you make a request online, two missionaries will reach out with a text, an email, or a phone call.
About us: We’re unpaid volunteers who come from all over the world. 
We take up to two years out of our lives to serve people and share the message of Jesus Christ. 
They’ll contact you to set up a visit that fits your schedule. 
Usually, it’s between 15 minutes and half an hour. 
It can be online, in your home, at church, or even in a public place. 
Then, the visit usually goes something like this:  
If you’re OK with it, we would usually start with a prayer. 
Then if you requested an item, we’ll give it to you, then share a quick message. 
If you told us beforehand you want to discuss a specific topic, we’ll come prepared to discuss it. 
And if you want to discuss something different, that’s completely fine. It’s your call. 
When we’re finished, we’ll ask you if you’d like another visit. 
If you say yes, great, we’ll set something up. If not, we’ll be on our way. 
And, that’s about it. Of course, every visit is different, but those are the basics. 
So, at a minimum, you have a nice conversation about God.  
But lots of people end up getting more out of it. You may be one of them. 
Only one way to find out!",27218787,4137,757,PT1M35S

While we can ask ourselves what makes a work of art so valuable, there’s a more interesting question to ponder. What is the value of art in the human experience? 

Aesthetic cognitivists have argued that art is valuable as a source of knowledge and understanding. But is there a demonstrable connection between art and understanding with reference to what Sir John Templeton referred to as spiritual reality in particular? Can art unlock new spiritual information? 

Join us as we enlist a host of artists, philosophers, theologians, and scientists from the psychological, cognitive, and social sciences to explore these questions.

Tomislav, after traveling the world for years with almost no money, shows how it is possible for everyone to do the same, if they really want to.

Tomislav Perko, 29, is a travel writer from Croatia. After a career of a stockbroker, broke because of the financial crisis, he hits the road and turns it into his home. He uses alternative ways of traveling – hitchhiking, couchsurfing, working/volunteering, and manages to wander around the world with just a little bit of money in his pocket, meeting the most amazing people on the way.

Five years later, he publishes a book “1000 Days of Spring” and goes around giving lectures about what it means to live on the road. Find out more on his website: http://tomislavperko.com/en/.

He shares five tips to try, whether you’re at the start of your career or contemplating your next act.  


Executive director of Stanford’s design program at the d.School, Bill Burnett uses design thinking, a career’s worth of starting companies and coaching students, and a childhood spent drawing cars and airplanes under his Grandmother’s sewing machine to inform his work on how to design your life. In five eyebrow-raising findings, Burnett offers simple but life-changing advice on designing the life you want, whether you are contemplating college or retirement. 

After years of drawing cars and airplanes under his Grandmother’s sewing machine, Bill Burnett went to college where he discovered that there were people in the world who did this kind of thing every day (without the sewing machine), and they were called designers. Thirty years, five companies, and a couple thousand students later, Burnett is still drawing and building things, teaching others how to do the same, and quietly enjoying the fact that no one has discovered that he is having too much fun. As Executive Director of the Design Program at Stanford, he runs undergraduate and graduate programs in design, both interdepartmental programs between the mechanical engineering and art departments. Burnett worked on design of the award-winning Apple PowerBooks and the original Hasbro Star Wars action figures. He holds a number of mechanical and design patents.

27,KVge98A5d1U,Nonprofits & Activism,29,Templeton Religion Trust,Covenantal Pluralism,2020-10-02T15:30:55Z,"What conditions contribute to progress in religion?

In religions, as in science and the economy, progress is possible, but under what conditions? Tolerance is a great starting point, but it can easily become a vehicle for apathy or indifference.  Sir John Templeton thought we could do better.  In fact, he believed that there’s vast, untapped potential beyond tolerance.  But how do we get there? It starts with humility.

If the sum total of what we know about spiritual reality is less than 1%, then should we not be eager to learn from other points of view? Sir John Templeton believed that engagement across difference accelerates discovery and leads to progress, unleashing social dividends that flow [or: result] from religious faith and practice at its best, transforming religious diversity from a troublesome fact into a positive force. Religions are often seen as competing for people’s hearts and minds, and to some extent this is true. But can religions engage one another cooperatively and constructively? How can we leverage religious diversity to make the world a better place? What are the conditions under which this can happen, and what are the most effective ways of fostering cooperative engagement across deep differences?

 
That’s why we’re seeking to identify, understand, and promote the conditions that contribute to or enable the sort of open-minded, cooperative competition that Sir John envisioned would lead to progress in religions.

He will show that there is a higher realm of language proficiency and explain what it takes to reach this “native” point where the benefits far surpass mere communication skills. Marc’s passion is the study of languages, their manifestation in local dialects, as well as their expression in poetry and folkloric song. He has acquired a near-native proficiency in six languages and their sub-forms and has given various musical performances.

medical animation: Ovarian Tissue Cryopreservation & Transplantation

Cincinnati Children’s Comprehensive Fertility Care & Preservation provides fertility counseling and preservation options to patients at risk for infertility due to medical treatments including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy through a diverse interdisciplinary team of providers. 

Ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) is an experimental procedure for preserving fertility typically used in pre-pubertal girls, since this is the only option before puberty, and in adolescent and young adult women who are not able to access standard of care procedures like egg freezing  (oocyte cryopreservation). OTC involves a minimally invasive surgery called laparoscopy to remove an ovary or a portion of an ovary for processing the surface tissue (containing the eggs) into small strips for freezing. The tissue is stored at a long-term storage facility until the patient’s care team determines the tissue is needed to help conceive a pregnancy.  At that time, ovarian tissue transplantation (OTT) is may be performed in select patients to restore ovarian function and provide eggs for conception.  After warming the ovarian tissue strips, a laparoscopic surgery is performed.  The tissue strips are placed into the lining of the pelvis (or peritoneum) in a small pocket near the location of the ovary or sutured onto the remaining ovary.  After OTT, return of ovarian function is monitored through blood work and pelvic ultrasound.  Once ovarian function is confirmed the patient can proceed attempting pregnancy naturally or with fertility treatments if necessary.

Dr. Crum says the biggest game changer is “YOU, by harnessing the power of your mind."" She explores scientific results that show the influence of the mindset on the body, and how changing the subjective mindset produced different outcomes. Dr. Crum's work is inspired in part by the placebo effect, and has implications that stretch far beyond the realm of medicine.

Dr. Crum is a professor, psychologist, and researcher investigating how mindsets affect health and behavior. 

Dr. Crum's research focuses on how changes in subjective mindsets—the lenses through which information is perceived, organized, and interpreted—can alter objective reality through behavioral, psychological, and physiological mechanisms. Her work is, in part, inspired by research on the placebo effect, a notable and consistent demonstration of the ability of the mindset to elicit healing properties in the body. She is interested in understanding how mindsets affect important outcomes outside the realm of medicine, in the domains of behavioral health and organizational behavior.

Are you ready to fasten your seatbelts and enjoy the ‘explosive’ journey?

In his talk, Andrew aims to promote chemistry as the science of remarkable changes, which are often overlooked yet so important in our everyday life. And he does it brilliantly by performing an incredible series of 25 experiments in 15 minutes, totally amazing the audience (who rewards him with a long and deserved standing ovation)!

 Andrew Z. Szydło is an internationally acclaimed chemistry teacher. But he’s definitely not the typical chemistry teacher you would expect…

He holds a PhD in the History and Philosophy of Science from UCL, and is an expert on the history of alchemy (his 1994 book ‘Water Which Does Not Wet Hands’ is considered to be the standard reference work on the Polish alchemist Michael Sendivogius.)

But his polymath spirit extends further: he’s a violin, bugle and accordion player, as well as a professional photographer. Throughout the years Andrew has wowed audiences all around the world with his pyrotechnical approach to teaching and demonstrating chemical sciences on stage and has appeared many times on TV.

As he describes it, his goal is not to achieve fluency in each, but rather to learn about foreign history and culture through the medium of language. He spends much of his time perfecting his linguistic skills in different neighborhoods around the city, and to date his Youtube channel has received over 3 million hits.

Our team at Penn's Abramson Cancer Center offers breast cancer survivors nipple tattoos after mastectomy to help their sense of femininity on the path to recovery.

Emily is a breast cancer survivor. After undergoing a double mastectomy and breast reconstructive surgery, she decided to get a nipple tattoo. A 3D nipple tattoo, also called micropigmentation, re-pigments the area to make it look more realistic. In this video, you can watch Emily during her nipple tattoo appointment to see how tattooed nipples are created and what a 3D nipple tattoo looks like. 

At Penn Medicine, nipple tattoos are created by Mandy Sauler, a micropigmentation specialist in plastic surgery. Mandy grew up in her mother's tattoo shop and started out as a conventional tattoo artist. After working for more than a decade as a tattoo artist, Mandy now works right in Penn hospitals and focuses on permanent cosmetics and 3D nipple tattoos. Mandy is board-certified by the American Academy of Micropigmentation and is a member of the Society of Permanent Cosmetics.

Is 26% proficiency in math acceptable to you?  That's the question teacher and Synergy Academies Founder Dr. Randy Palisoc asks the TEDxManhattanBeach audience.  With only 26% of U.S. twelfth graders proficient in mathematics, Randy shares his solution: teach math as a language. Putting words back into math lessons enables even the youngest school-age minds to grasp complex concepts, such as fractions, that are traditionally thought of as abstract and difficult to understand.  In his stunningly simple and effective approach, math no longer creates problems for kids but solves them.

Randy Palisoc is a passionate educator, known for making math easy.  A founder of the five-time national award winning Synergy Academies, Randy is proud to identify Synergy as an “in spite of” school.  In spite of the fact that its students were disadvantaged and in spite of the fact that it did not have its own facility and had to pack up its classrooms every single week, his school was the first and only elementary school in South Los Angeles to ever win the National Blue Ribbon Award, and was named the #1 Urban Elementary School in America in 2013.

Seeking a broader impact, Randy left Synergy this year to start Ironbox Education.  One of the ways he believes we can dramatically improve America’s schools is by doing a better job teaching math to our students in a way that makes sense to them.  Randy believes implementing a few changes in the way we approach math will give students the confidence and thinking skills to be more competitive in a global economy.

The “Game Changer” he most admires is Steve Jobs, because he had the ability to envision things we did not even know we needed or wanted.
