2,pIzIxst8h-0,Education,27,Looper,Why You Never Hear From Phoebe Cates Anymore,2016-09-14T16:00:04Z,"Phoebe Cates is perhaps best remembered for being one of the most recognizable teen idols of the '80s. She rose to fame when she appeared in the coming-of-age comedy Fast Times at Ridgemont High.

Cates played Linda Barrett in the film, and her famous bikini drop scene cemented her place as a teen idol. Cates began appearing on the cover of teen magazines like Seventeen, Tiger Beat, and Teen Beat -- which were popular magazines of the time.

Cates also appeared in the Gremlins movies in the late '80s and early '90s but she has since gradually moved away from the Hollywood spotlight. What has this former teen idol been up to lately, and why don‚Äôt we hear from her anymore?

7,4Rx7CEqZAFw,Education,27,Abhi and Niyu,Why UPI can make India a financial superpower? UPI international explained by Abhi and Niyu,2023-07-21T13:00:12Z,"In this video, Abhi and Niyu explain how UPI is going international. Recently Prime Minister Modi was in France for Bastille day celebrations. He was invited by the French President Emanuel Macron. On this occasion PM Modi announced a very important partnership. Now UPI will work in France. Indian tourists will be able to pay via UPI in Eiffel tower. This will be a huge victory for NPCI and India to prove that our digital infrastructure can work seamlessly in the western world.

#UPI #Modi #abhiandniyu

Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is an instant real-time payment system developed by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) facilitating inter-bank peer-to-peer (P2P) and person-to-merchant (P2M) transactions. The interface is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and works by instantly transferring funds between two bank accounts on a mobile platform.

UPI is a convenient and secure way to make payments, and it has become increasingly popular in India in recent years. In fact, UPI transactions now account for over 75% of all digital payments in India.

Here are some of the benefits of using UPI:

It is instant and real-time.
It is secure and encrypted.
It is convenient and easy to use.
It is available 24/7.
It is free to use for most transactions.
If you are looking for a convenient and secure way to make payments, then UPI is a great option. You can use UPI to transfer money to friends and family, pay for goods and services, and even recharge your mobile phone.

While it may seem unimaginable, the scientific implications behind this theoretical collision are both fascinating and staggering. Picture this: a mere 1-gram needle hurtling towards our planet at the speed of light. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy generated at the time of collision would dwarf the explosive force of the world's largest atomic bomb, ""T jar,"" by a staggering three times! The sheer magnitude of this energy release surpasses even the most powerful man-made explosions in history. The immense energy transfer and its potential impact on our planet. Despite the needle's minuscule size, its tremendous velocity would lead to an unimaginable release of energy upon contact with the Earth's surface. This tremendous force could trigger a chain reaction of seismic activity, resulting in a catastrophic earthquake, and even unleash powerful tsunamis capable of affecting coastal regions around the world.

Russia has buzzed yet another US plane. Earlier this week Russia flew dangerously close to a manned US spy plane over Syria and endangered the lives of 4 Americans. This comes as Russia is attempting to break a record of harassment, after they‚Äôve harassed the US‚Äôs drones, planes, and troops over 5 times this month by dropping fuel on them, buzzing them, and dropping flares on them. The US has urged Russia to cut it out, saying that Russia should act like a professional air force so we can resume our focus on the enduring defeat of.

11. Casu Marzu 
Figured I‚Äôd start you off with a bang!! Casu Marzu? That can‚Äôt be so bad right? It‚Äôs Sardinian Maggot Cheese. It‚Äôs a delicacy in Sardinia and Corsica. (You know, where Napoleon was from!) It‚Äôs even considered an aphrodisiac.
Casu Marzu, which literally means ‚Äúputrid cheese,‚Äù is made by taking whole pecorino cheeses outside, cutting off the top of the rind, and leaving them open to the air. 

10. Ackee
Ackee is the national fruit of Jamaica. Originally native to West Africa, it was brought to Jamaica as part of the trade in 1778. Not all of the fruit is safe to eat!! The ackee fruit is deadly if it‚Äôs eaten before it‚Äôs fully ripe, and it needs to be carefully prepared. It can only be eaten when the outer pod is red and opens on its own, and when the flesh around the seed (the aril) is golden in color. 

9. Absinthe
Also called the green fairy, this liqueur was a favorite of the Victorian artistic set and Goth scene members everywhere. Everyone from Vincent Van Gogh to Ernest Hemingway drank Absinthe and Toulouse-Lautrec even mixed it with Cognac! You know, because it‚Äôs not strong enough already!! 

8. Wild Mushrooms
For many people, no trip to the woods would be complete without mushroom hunting. Many wild mushrooms are safe to eat, but if you aren‚Äôt 100% sure about what you‚Äôre doing you could be in trouble! The safe ones often have look-alike toxic cousins. Eating toxic wild mushrooms can be deadly. There are many toxic mushrooms, but one of the most lethal is the aptly-named cap mushroom. 

7. Fugu 
Chefs in Japan train for years to learn how to properly prepare fugu (or puffer fish) for the table. The preparation and sale of fugu is heavily regulated because the fish is so extremely dangerous. The ovaries, intestines and liver of the puffer fish contain a poison called tetrodotoxin, which is 1,200 times more lethal than cyanide. 

6. H√°karl
H√°karl is the national dish of Iceland. It‚Äôs made of the meat of the Greenland shark, which is poisonous before it‚Äôs properly processed. The meat has high levels of uric acid and trimethylamine oxide, which is a natural antifreeze that protects the shark in cold arctic water. These chemicals are present in such a high concentration that only a few bites of uncured meat is enough to you.

5. Sannakji
Octopus that‚Äôs properly cooked and prepared is not a problem. It‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs served in Korea that can be deadly. It's called ""sannakji"" and it‚Äôs not just about the taste. It‚Äôs rumored to boost a man‚Äôs  stamina...
Sannakji is the wriggling tentacles of a baby octopus that was seasoned and chopped while it was still alive, and they‚Äôre served immediately. 

4. Cassava
Also called yucca, cassava is a resilient and hardy plant that‚Äôs grown in the arid climates of Africa and South America. It‚Äôs incredibly drought-resistant and is a major source of calories, starch and carbs. It grows well where usually it‚Äôs tough for people to find enough to eat. 

3. Bean Sprouts
Who knew, right?? Mung bean sprouts are feature in many Asian dishes, and they‚Äôre a delicious, crispy and moist addition to a stir fry, salad or sandwich. Sprouts have long been featured as a part of the ‚Äúclean eating‚Äù movement, and for good reason. They can be very beneficial. But these innocent-looking guys have a dark side, though. But don‚Äôt we all. 

2. Blood Clams
More seafood! This one with a very unpleasant name. Blood clams are salt-water clams that are found along the Pacific rim all the way from South Africa to the coast of Japan. They get their name because they contain very high levels of hemoglobin in their flesh, which causes their juices to look like, well, blood. 

1. Fruit Bat Soup
Come ooon!! Who doesn‚Äôt want to eat that!? I‚Äôm just kidding, I know you don‚Äôt. 
When guns were introduced to Guam, it suddenly became easier for locals to and eat their indigenous fruit bat, the Mariana Flying Fox.

Today we're looking at the ten most expensive things in the world that money can buy. They say the best things in life are free, but if you've got a few million dollars just lying around, some of the items on this list aren't half-bad either! Welcome to this episode of the Infographics Show, The Ten Most Expensive Things In The World, part 2.

Gold-plated Bugatti Veyron 0:25
Gold-plated Bugatti Veyron, with a price tag of $10 million dollars. Known for extremely high-performance luxury sports cars, Bugatti outdid itself with the development of the Veyron. 

Ferrari 250 GTO 3:40
Ferrari has a rich tradition of supercars, and few hold a place dearer to a car enthusiast's heart than the Ferrari 250 GTO. Originally designed to compete in the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race, only 39 models remain in existence. In February 2012, a 1964 Ferrari 250 GTO set the world record for most expensive car ever sold, fetching a whopping $32 million dollars, only to have the record broken just a few months later by another GTO sale for $35 million. However, fast forward to October 2013 when an anonymous London collector bought a 1963 GTO for an incredible $52 million dollars. With a price tag like that it's easy to see why this collector thinks its best to remain anonymous.

History Supreme 7:55
From homes to jewelry to cars- our list of the ten most expensive things in the world wouldn't be complete without that most iconic item of extreme luxury and wealth: the yacht. But not just any yacht- at $4.5 billion dollars, the History Supreme is both the most expensive thing in the world, and the most 'blinged out' thing ever created. From bow to stern the yacht holds over 220,000 lbs (99,790 kg) of precious metals that cover everything, and we mean everything: from the hull, to the deck, to the railing, and even the anchor- everything aboard the History Supreme is made of, or covered, in gold or platinum. Inside, the galley holds wine glasses made of diamond and plates of pearl and fine china- but the real price is in the main bedroom which holds a meteoric stone embedded with real T-Rex dinosaur bones. Owned by Robert Kuok, richest man in Malaysia, the History Supreme can often be spotted at some of the most prestigious coastal events in the world, such as the Cannes Film Festival.

Ukraine is now threatening a tit-for-tat against Russia after Russia threatened to sink civilian vessels traveling to Ukraine. With Ukraine now saying that all ships heading to Russia will be considered to be carrying military cargo with all corresponding risks. This comes after Russia blew up over 60,000 tons of grain meant for China in a Ukrainian port. Russia‚Äôs goal is to scare ships from going to Ukrainian ports and now Ukraine is doing the same to Russia. What a fun time to be a fisherman in the Black Sea
