A single wheel takes at least one year to age, 131 gallons of milk to make, and it can only be made in a restricted area in northern Italy, in the region of Emilia Romagna.

Most of it is produced industrially, using pasteurized milk, but there are 280 farmers across the country still making raw-milk boerenkaas, or farmer's cheese. And there are only two farms that take their cheese to the next level, making Boeren Goudse Oplegkaas, or aged artisanal Gouda, a special type of raw-milk farmhouse cheese that must weigh at least 20 kilograms, must age at least two years, and can be made only in the summer with cattle grazing in the Green Heart region, between the cities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Utrecht.

We met with cheesemaker Marije Van der Poel, who lives on an island in the village of Rijpwetering in South Holland with her husband, Hugo, and their three children and makes 15 wheels of aged artisanal Gouda every day at the back of their house.

Japanese workers are often portrayed as Salarymen but in this video we focus on Japanese food services industry and what it is like to work in a Japanese restaurant.  This is a day in the life of a Japanese Chef, Tetsuya, 41 years old, working in Japan at a ramen store, karashibi miso ramen Kinkanbo.  It's a popular spicy ramen shop in Tokyo Japan serving a devil ramen.  We see Japanese working hours as well as Japanese workers in a Tokyo ramen restaurant, a peek into Japanese life.  Tetsuya starts the day in his apartment and as an average Japanese worker, he commutes to work in Tokyo via train.  It only takes him 20 minutes to get to work, but soon after arriving, he's busy working at the Japanese food restaurant and preparing Japanese ramen noodles for customers.  His main duty is the manager of the ramen shop, but he also creates new gentei limited time menu items as a Japanese ramen chef.  Life in Tokyo is amazing and part of this is because we have dedicated workers in Japan that keep the city running.  To be a Japanese chef you must really have a passion for what  you do.  If you are ever looking for a spicy food challenge or spicy ramen challenge in Tokyo, then the Kikanbo ramen shop should be you first destination.  But don't worry, if you can't eat spicy ramen, the ramen shop also prepares non-spicy version of the ramen bowl.  Customers can choose their level of spiciness from low all the way to Oni level, aka Devil ramen. Enjoy this Japanese food tour of a Japanese ramen shop.

To Jean-Yves, the malaxage is a more romantic way to make butter. At his workshop, everything is churned, kneaded, and shaped by hand.

Also lizards from primeval times have their habitat in this region of the planet.

Luckily, in reality, small damage to fuselage won't have such dramatic consequences. But a big opening in a plane’s side will.

SUMMARY:
- At 1:25 pm, on April 28, 1988, a 19-year-old Boeing 737 that belonged to Aloha Airlines left Hilo International Airport and headed for Honolulu. 
- When the plane arrived at this destination, the pilots didn’t leave the cockpit or inspect the aircraft from the outside. After all, it wasn't a requirement, and they didn't have to do it. 
- The length of the missing part was 18.5 ft long, and that was the aircraft skin that covered the plane from the cockpit back to the fore-wing area.  
- The plane started to roll from side to side, and it was becoming increasingly harder to control. Everybody who was in the cockpit immediately put on their oxygen masks, and the captain took over the aircraft. 
- All three flight attendants were standing along the aircraft aisle. The one who was the closest to the front of the plane was swept out through the hole in the roof. 
- But the problem was at that time, in case of emergency, the airport control tower had to dial 911 just like anyone else. l
- As the plane was approaching the runway, the left engine failed, and the aircraft started rocking and shaking. The captain made an attempt to restart the engine but didn't succeed. 
- Everyone on the plane, except for the flight attendant who had been pulled out of the plane, was alive, although 65 people were injured. Most people had been hurt by flying debris and torn pieces of fuselage. 
- During one interview that followed the accident, passenger Gayle Yamamoto remembered that she had spotted a crack in the fuselage when she was boarding. Unfortunately, she was the only one who had seen this damage, and the woman hadn't thought that the crack was important enough to inform the crew.
