You can try making one yourself, to treat your friends or family. It's such an amazing idea for a party, right?

To make this huge version of Kinder Joy, you'll need spherical molds, an egg-shaped mold, lots of milk and white chocolate, Nutella, condensed milk, nuts and wafers. 

First, melt milk chocolate and pour some of the chocolate into the spherical molds, spreading it inside the molds in a thin layer. Place pieces of wafers inside and fill them to the top with Nutella. Let them set in the fridge.

Spread a thin layer of milk chocolate over the egg-shaped mold. Let it set and do the same with white chocolate. While the chocolate is setting, take out the spherical shapes and combine them in pairs. Cover the surface with melted chocolate and then dip them into crushed nuts.

Take the chocolate egg out of the mold and fill it first with Nutella, then with melted white chocolate combined with condensed milk. Place the chocolate spheres into this soft filling and allow everything to set again. After that, take a spoon and dig in!

Check out Anna's brand new chocolate chip cookie recipe here: https://youtu.be/-BzsecuF6GY

Subscribe for more video recipes: http://goo.gl/MJV4af

Ingredients 

¬Ω cup (115 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
¬Ω cup (100 g) packed light brown sugar
¬Ω cup (100 g) granulated sugar
1 large egg, at room temperature
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 ¬º cup (185 g) all-purpose flour
1 Tbsp (7.5 g) cornstarch
¬Ω tsp (2.5 g) baking soda
¬Ω tsp (2.5 g) salt
1 ¬Ω cup (262 g) chocolate chips
1 cup (100 g) lightly toasted, coarsely chopped pecans (optional)

Directions

1. Cream the butter with the brown sugar and granulated sugar together well. Beat in the egg and the vanilla.

2. In a separate bowl, sift the flour with the cornstarch, baking soda and salt. Add this to the butter mixture and stir until blended. Stir in the chocolate chips and pecans (if using).

3. Using a small ice cream scoop or a tablespoon, scoop spoonfuls of dough (about 2 Tbsp) shape them into a ball and place onto a parchment lined baking tray or a plate. Chill the scooped cookies for at least an hour, or once chilled, the cookies can be frozen for baking later.

4. Preheat the oven to 325¬∫F (162 C). Arrange the chilled scooped cookies onto parchment-lined baking trays, leaving 3 inches between the cookies. Bake for 15-18 minutes, until browned around the edges. Cool the cookies on the baking tray. If baking cookie dough that has been frozen, arrange the frozen cookies on the baking tray and let them thaw for 20 minutes at room temperature before baking as above.

Let cool slightly and enjoy.

Sue was left at home all alone! But it's a good thing that she knows what to do! She decided not to waste any time and make a model of her future bedroom in Victoria's Secret style! It includes pink, black, and white colors. Especially considering that pink is her favorite color.

So, the floors of the room will be in bright solid colors, and the walls will be bright pink in stripes! Since it's a bedroom, we'll need the actual bed. Sue likes big beds, so we'll make it taller using the body of our bed. The bed of a real princess has the canopy, so let's make it! Next to the bed, we will place a small soft sofa in black and white with bright pillows!

The main thing is the desk with different hanging shelves, a laptop, and a comfortable chair. This place will be convenient for Sue to work! To make the bedroom cozier, we will add decor! We'll hang pictures on the walls, lay a carpet, and put plants. Look how adorable it is! We are in love with this decor! We are sure that Sammy will be surprised by such a stunning decor of new Sue's room!

Liz breaks down cheap vs expensive parmesan cheese, goat cheese, gruy√®re cheese, feta cheese, and blue cheese. For each round of cheap cheese vs expensive cheese, Liz visually analyzed, smelled, then executed a taste test before guessing which cheese cost more. Once the prices were revealed, Thorpe explained why a specific cheese making process costs more and dives into the specifics of how to make the different cheeses.
