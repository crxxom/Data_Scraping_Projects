Without hearing, dancers use sound vibrations to interpret the beat; without sight, musicians use breathing patterns to keep pace. Together, they perform the ‚ÄúThousand-hand Bodhisattva,‚Äù one of the most challenging pieces for the troupe to learn. Today, they‚Äôve taken their talents around the world, performing in over 100 countries.

So how did Sam Holtz, the 2015 winner of ESPN's March Madness Bracket Challenge, beat out almost 12 million other entries and score a near-perfect bracket? For one: he didn‚Äôt watch any college basketball before the tournament. A Great Big Story told with our friends at Bleacher Report.

Because SPYPOINT is activating and installing both sim cards before it arrives to the hunter, setup and use is made much easier. The camera has access to both sim cards without the hunter having to do anything.

When the camera is turned on, it checks one of the cards for network connectivity. If a usable network signal is found, then it stops right there. It‚Äôs done, and it will use that network to send photos and videos to the SPYPOINT app. If the first sim checked doesn‚Äôt return a quality network connection, then it will move on to the second sim card, and scan that network for a reliable signal.

With both sim cards being installed, there‚Äôs another major benefit. Should something happen to the network quality the camera selected, the FLEX will automatically check the other sim card to see if performance can be improved by switching to the other card. The camera is doing this automatically. You don‚Äôt have to do anything except sit back and let the FLEX do its thing.

Blisters is a big problem when you get new football boots, and they can ruin things for even the bravest players. But how to avoid getting blisters or treat them the best way possible? Today, we give you 5 tips on how to avoid blisters and how to never get blisters again. If you do get a blister and want to learn how to treat blisters, we've also got some advice for you here.

It's also a good idea to either use grip socks or blister preventing tape such as the Marcure tape - and in the event you get a blister, you can always you blister bandages to prevent them from getting even worse inside your football boots.

 Footage from the Women's Synchronised Diving 10m Platform Final at the London 2012 Olympic Games in which China's Chen Ruolin and Wang Hao won Gold with Mexico's Alejandra Orozco Loza and Paola Espinosa Sanchez in Silver and Canada's Roseline Filion and Meaghan Benfeito with the Bronze. 

Diving was included in the Olympic Games for the first time at the 1904 Games in St Louis. The springboard and platform events have been included since the 1908 Olympic Games in London. Since the Stockholm Games in 1912, women have taken part in the diving events. The diving programme has been relatively stable since the 1928 Games in Amsterdam: men and women take part in 10-metre high-dive and 3-metre springboard events. In 2000, the Sydney Games witnessed the entrance of synchronised diving on both the springboard and the platform.

 The USA's Gabrielle Douglas wins the Gold medal in the women's artistic gymnastics individual all-around event in the North Greenwich Arena at the London 2012 Olympic Games (2 August).

Russia's Victoria Komova and Aliya Mustafina won the silver and bronze medals in the event.



Artistic gymnastics was introduced at the very first Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens, and has been present at every edition of the Games since then. At the beginning, it comprised disciplines that are difficult to qualify as ""artistic"", such as climbing and acrobatics.

The foundations of the Olympic gymnastics programme were laid at the 1924 Games in Paris, when the men's apparatus individual and team competitions appeared. In 1928, women were included in the Amsterdam Games. It was not until 1952 that the women's programme was developed, with seven events, and then stabilised at six events as from the 1960 Games in Rome.

It was a wake-up call; with the surfing advancing faster than the safety system, something had to change. Later that year, Kohl Christensen and Danilo Couto got a group of surfers together on the North Shore, Oahu, and held a CPR course. It was the first unofficial Big Wave Risk Assessment Group meeting which over the next decade would evolve into a worldwide, 14-stop tour covering ocean risk management, CPR and AED training, medical intervention, spot analysis, mindful breathing, emergency action planning and water rescue, taught by some of the best emergency response trained big wave surfers in the world.",624262,1081,42,PT7M54S
