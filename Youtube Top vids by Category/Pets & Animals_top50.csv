There are different ways for a veterinarian to aspirate a lipoma, but in all cases, the dog does not seem to react or notice. Typically, the needle is very small—often the size that is used for canine vaccinations.

WARNING—Graphic video:  If procedures that use needles are upsetting, please skip this video.

On this episode of Breaking Trail, Coyote is stung by an infamous COW KILLER…the Velvet Ant!

The Velvet Ant, which is actually a species of wingless wasp, is well known for possessing one of the most painful stings in the insect kingdom. In fact, this legendary sting is so painful it has even earned them the nickname “cow killer” because it is said to be so excruciating it can actually kill a cow. 

Now the cow killing part is simply a myth but in his quest to work all the way up the insect sting pain index to the most painful sting on record, which is that of the Bullet Ant, Coyote has decided he better find out just how bad the number four ranked Velvet Ant is first.

Get ready, you're about to witness Coyote’s most painful sting yet!

On this episode of Breaking Trail, Coyote gets stung by a terrifying Tarantula Hawk! 

Boasting the world’s 2nd most painful sting, the Tarantula Hawk also happens to be the largest species of wasp in North America! These enormous spider wasps are most notorious for their macabre breeding habits but are also becoming well known for their ranking on the insect sting pain index. Only trailing in behind the bullet ant in terms of “sting pain” Coyote felt it necessary to experience this fear inducing sting before taking on the highly anticipated bullet ant challenge.

So will this be the end of the line in Coyote’s sting quest…or will Coyote pass his final exam before meeting the “king of sting”? - the Bullet Ant

This African elephant is on the verge of death. It was likely tusked in its side by another male elephant during a fight. What happens next reveals how enormously important an elephant is to its ecosystem. Elephants arrive on the scene to mourn the loss of their fellow elephant. The mourning process includes “body-mounting,” in which they climb on the carcass. They also mourn by walking backwards towards the body, often touching it with their hind foot. They will explore the body with their trunks and front feet. Whether elephants culturally transmit and learn these actions is part of an ongoing study. Hyenas arrived overnight and opened the belly of the carcass, tearing through the tough elephant hide. This gives the opportunity for white-backed vultures to feed.

Vultures don’t have strong enough beaks to tear through the elephant's hide, so they have to wait in line behind the hyenas. While sad, these deaths are crucial for ecosystems. These feasts can be life saving for vultures, whose populations have plummeted worldwide as humans have changed their habitats and poisoned them. A leopard comes to investigate but decides to eat elsewhere. Elephant carcasses briefly become busy ecosystems of their own. Apart from scavenging, there’s a full community of decomposers like maggots that chow down on anything the bigger scavengers don’t get to quickly enough. A carcass site becomes soaked with blood and fluids that are released during decomposition, creating a fertile patch of ground as microbes release nutrients into the soil. 

Scientists use carcass counts for keeping tabs on elephant population health. So not only does this elephant's carcass provide a highly beneficial service to the surrounding ecosystem ... it may ultimately help with science and elephant conservation.

In this video, the adorable little dachshunds Crusoe and Daphne are overjoyed to the idea of #reopening  and so rush outside in pure excitement to run around the yard, not realizing that dogs were always allowed to go outside even during lockdowns and quarantine! But oh well.

They then decide they want to go into public to get some ice cream. But of course, they need their masks to go into public, and to practice physical distancing. So Daphne rushes to make some masks on the sewing machine for the family. Although, they don't turn out so good and turns out DAD is the one which has to sew!

Finally they make their masks and go get some ice cream, from a rather strange labrador dog ice cream server who eats all their ice cream.

At the end, Crusoe has some words about his surgery. Thanks for being a fan of Crusoe the dachshund and we appreciate your support and care for our little puppy...

Wildlife biologist Liz Bonnin goes on a journey of discovery to find out the science behind unusual interactions in the animal kingdom. Some of the surprising associations include a polar bear befriending huskies, a cat mothering ducklings, and an orangutan who keeps a pet dog. These odd pairings are not just limited to different species; animal relationships with humans are also explored, as people have been known to keep exotic pets such as lions, hippos and buffalos. Bonnin investigates the root of the affectionate connections and tries to uncover the reasons for the behaviours. 
Some people have sought out unusual, and even potentially dangerous relationships, with some very surprising animals.""

This was one of the hardest builds I've ever done, with challenges at every corner. Each house (SpongeBob Squarepants, Squidward Tentacles and Patrick Star) were incredibly hard to print. I'm so happy with how Bikini Bottom turned out and my sister couldn't believe the special surprise at the end! 

As you may know, Petco sells SpongeBob Squarepants' houses for fish tanks, but they are just too small. I wanted to make Bikini Bottom for a much larger fish tank so I took matters into my own hands. I used a 3D printer to make Bikini Bottom in this fish tank. PLA is both food and fish safe and great for making aquarium ornaments and parts.
