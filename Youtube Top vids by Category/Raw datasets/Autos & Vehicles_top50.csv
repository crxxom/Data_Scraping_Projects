You’ll hear technicians above and below the bay calling out their progress to each other during the process. That’s to ensure the proper steps are taken to service your vehicle the right way.

Once your car is filled with fresh oil and all of your systems have been checked, a courtesy technician will wash exterior windows and vacuum the interior floorboards.

----------------------
The basic formula for a limousine is pretty simple. Some workers cut a factory-made car in half then increase the length of the original vehicle by installing an extension space in the middle. The drivetrain components and electronic wiring are adjusted accordingly so they can still work without a hitch despite the addition. Once the extended structure is done and the vehicle actually works like any regular car, the interior gets its lavish treatments to provide luxury for passengers. Some of the most luxurious are as follows.

Cars have single cams, overhead cams, dual overhead cams and even triple overhead cams to help them do their jobs.

Everybody knows that cars are about horsepower and torque!  But what does that even mean?  What is Horsepower?  What is Torque? We get into the nitty gritty of force- talkin’ ‘bout Torque and ft. lbs., and we build up to the triumphant power we measure with horses. It's Horsepower! ...did I need to say horsepower?  We explore the relationship between horsepower and torque.   You’ll find out what all those dyno numbers mean, and why diesel engines can make a bunch of torque, but not always as much horsepower as gas engines.  It’s FORCE!  It’s POWER! It’s HORSES!  It’s SCIENCE GARAGE!

This is the new Skoda Octavia! Now we know that the Czech manufacturer may not be held in such high regard as its German rivals, and they’re not exactly known for being the most exciting cars. But when you consider just how much car you get for a relatively low price, along with a huge choice of engines and trims to choose from so you can spec the car just to your liking, is it time the Octavia hatchback and estate are considered alongside the class leaders? Stick with Mat and find out in his latest in-depth review!

Introducing the all-new Honda Civic Type R! 

It’s the 6th generation Type R, as well as the 25th anniversary of the very first Type R being released, and it’s time to find out if it’s the best hot Civic yet! 

So for starters, let’s take a look at the design. If anything this new Type R has been toned down compared to the 5th generation. Gone is the big bonnet scoop, instead replaced by a small vent. Speaking of vents, a number of fake ones found on the previous generation have also been removed, as have the stuck-on wheel arch extensions! All in all, it still looks great, even if it’s a bit less in your face than before. 

When it comes to performance, you’ll find the same 2-litre 4-cylinder turbo under the bonnet as before. Now, we don’t know the power figures just yet, but we do know that this will be the most powerful Type R yet! As a result, it’ll have more than 320hp, which makes it more powerful than a Golf R, Audi S3, BMW M135i and an AMG A35! 

On the inside, the new Type R is pretty similar to the standard Civic, although it’s got a number of exclusive upgrades including bright red sports seats, a different steering wheel, and of course, a shiny titanium gear stick! 

So what do you think, is this the best-looking Type R yet? Or should Honda have made it even wilder than the previous generation? Let us know in the COMMENTS!

For more than 75 years, the Jeep name has been indelibly associated with freedom, authenticity, adventure and passion. These are vehicles for “dreamers and doers”–forging extraordinary, uncommon bonds between themselves and their owners, because adventure is found in every Jeep vehicle’s DNA. The Jeep badge stands for more than a brand. In truth, it’s a badge of honor.
