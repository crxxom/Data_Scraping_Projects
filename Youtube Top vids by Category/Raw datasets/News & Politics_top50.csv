A man suffered from a form of ankylosing spondylitis so severe that his upper body folded onto his thighs. Three parts of his body were ‘connected’ – his chin to his chest, his breastbone to his pubic bone, and his face to his thigh bone. After undergoing four operations at Shenzhen University General Hospital, in which his bones were literally broken and reconstructed, he finally stood straight – after 28 years.

A Tampa woman who fought off an attacker at her apartment complex's gym is speaking out about her experience in the hopes that other women will feel more empowered.

Nashali Alma, 24, said she was exercising in her complex's gym, about 12 miles northwest of downtown Tampa, in late January when a man who looked familiar to her needed access to the gym, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office said.

Alma said she let the man in because she had seen him in the gym before. But as she was working out, Alma told investigators that the man approached her and grabbed her waist. Alma said she yelled at the man to get away from her but he kept chasing her around the gym, police said.

Following the success of this year's action blockbuster Ip Man, biopic of the legendary Wing Chun grandmaster and mentor to Bruce Lee, a revival of the Chinese martial art has taken Hong Kong by storm.
 
In this video we meet sifu Ip Chun, son and successor of none other than Ip Man. He currently teaches classes at the humble Ving Tsun Athletic Association's headquarters in Mong Kok which was established in 1967. Ip Chun prefers to see Wing Chun as a health regimen rather than just a form of combat.
 
The spry 84-year-old tells us about all things Wing Chun and his thoughts on the future of the martial art in today's society.

Learn more about work-life balance secrets from the happiest countries in the world on CNBC Make It: https://cnb.cx/37So3YY

Each year, a group of happiness experts from around the globe rank 156 countries based on how “happy” citizens are, and they publish their findings in the World Happiness Report. Happiness might seem like an elusive concept to quantify, but there is a science to it.

When researchers talk about “happiness,” they’re referring to “satisfaction with the way one’s life is going,” Jeff Sachs, co-creator of the World Happiness Report and a professor at Columbia University, tells CNBC Make It.

“It’s not primarily a measure of whether one laughed or smiled yesterday, but how one feels about the course of one’s life,” he says.

Since the report began in 2012, Nordic countries — which include Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland, plus the Faroe Islands, Greenland and Aland — consistently turn up at the top of the list. (The United States, on the other hand, typically lands somewhere around 18th or 19th place.)

(Aired 2018)

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: http://www.pbs.org/donate​.

In the 2018 documentary, Trump’s Showdown, filmmaker Michael Kirk and his team (America After 9/11, Bannon’s War) methodically reveal how an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election grew to threaten Donald Trump’s presidency. 

The film draws on more than 60 in-depth interviews with former heads of U.S. intelligence agencies, Trump insiders, attorneys, authors and journalists. Thousands of photographs and hundreds of hours of archival footage pull together the entire story – from the days just before Trump’s inauguration to the increasingly chaotic events that ensnared powerful members of Trump’s inner circle and threatened the president himself.

After a series of complicated and risky surgeries, China’s “folded man” is finally able to stand upright for the first time in 28 years. Li Hua suffers from ankylosing spondylitis which can cause bones to fuse and the spine curve forward. In the case of 47-year-old Li, his upper body folded forward completely. After enduring four surgeries which involved breaking and reconstructing some of his bones, he is gradually adjusting to a far more normal life than he had before.
