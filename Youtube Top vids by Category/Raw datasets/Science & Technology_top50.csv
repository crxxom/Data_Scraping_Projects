0,f2mdMcf-fJs,Science & Technology,28,MihaiDesigns,Who says one nozzle is enough!? 3D printing with different nozzle sizes,2021-06-04T12:54:58Z,"Most people only 3D print with the stock 0.4mm nozzle that came with the printer. Like a camera that comes with a stock lens, there's a lot you can do with it, but there are other options that open up new possibilities.

Use smaller nozzles for tiny details and larger ones for quicker printing. Trouble is that plastic doesn't have enough time to melt, so the larger nozzles will have to be longer as well, with longer heating blocks.

New hotends are coming out every day with improved melting capabilities, optimized for higher temperatures, or with other cool tweaks. But E3D's open sourced V6 hotend is still one of the best in terms of value. They've then expanded the options to the Volcano and the SuperVolcano hotends for more and more throughput.

Larger nozzles do have a downside: they can't print small details. So it's not a one size fits all kind of scenario. It's a matter of using the right nozzle for the job. 3D printing is awesome!

This bit left a very clean cut that was filled with Total Boat 2:1 epoxy and some pure white Black Diamond Pigment.

In the Arctic, enormous releases of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, threaten the climate.

Colossal explosions shake a remote corner of the Siberian tundra, leaving behind massive craters. In Alaska, a huge lake erupts with bubbles of inflammable gas. Scientists are discovering that these mystifying phenomena add up to a ticking time bomb, as long-frozen permafrost melts and releases vast amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. What are the implications of these dramatic developments in the Arctic? Scientists and local communities alike are struggling to grasp the scale of the methane threat and what it means for our climate future.
