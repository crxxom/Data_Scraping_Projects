Do you remember how we built a stunning house for Disney Queen Elsa https://clck.ru/SakDu ? This house was beautiful! But it looks like Elsa needs a bigger castle! That‚Äôs why today we're going to make a huge magical house for her!

First of all, we need to make a good base for our multi-story house. The base and the roof are the most important part of any house. Therefore, we will put up the walls and cover the house with a roof. The sparkly stairs will connect the first and the second floor. By the way, Elsa's new house is a transformer-house! We can close it whenever we want! When all the main details are ready, we continue with the interior decorations. We're decorating our house in a winter style. It means, that all the furniture should be in cold colors. 

On the first floor, there will be a kitchen and a chic bathroom. And there's a cool garage for Elsa's new car! It's just awesome! On the second floor, there is a bedroom with a large and soft bed, a wardrobe, and a small balcony for gatherings on cozy evenings. On the third floor, there is another room with a baby's cradle. After all, someday Elsa may have a baby!

The last but not least - the Christmas tree! We're done! Come on and check out this magical house for a Disney queen Elsa! See you in 2021! Bye-bye!

50-Minute Fettuccine Alfredo:

FRESH FETTUCCINE:
3 large eggs, beaten to blend
2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
1 splash olive oil
1 pinch salt

1. Mix flour, eggs, olive oil, and salt with a fork or a bench scraper.
2. Knead until smooth, roughly 10 minutes, or use a dough hook attachment in a stand mixer to knead until smooth.
3. Cover with plastic wrap and rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.
4. Cut into quarters, then roll out with a flour-dusted rolling pin.
5. Run through a pasta machine, starting at a 0 setting and incrementing up to a 6 or a 7 setting, cutting the sheet in half if the pasta gets long.
6. Switch to a fettuccine cutting attachment and run the pasta sheets through. Dust noodles with flour, twist into nests, and cover until ready to cook.

You like carrots or not you will like this carrot cake. It's soft and moist, you don't really taste carrot in it. The orange flavour goes very well with it, This is my own recipe and this is how I like my carrot cake. but if you want to use vanilla, cinnamon, or almond you certainly can. Although I strongly recommend that you try the way it is. 
If you like this carrot cake you might also like this lemon cake  https://youtu.be/R7Y8sAZmIO0

In this video, I‚Äôll show you how to cast on knitting like a pro! This is the thumb method cast on. If you have no idea what that means - no worries! Just know that it‚Äôs an easy and super useful cast on that both beginners and old hands use all the time.

So, you‚Äôve got needles and a ball of yarn. Cool! Now you want to knit something. But how do you get the yarn onto your needles? 

Say hello to the cast on! 

Casting on is a way to turn loose yarn into neat stitches that can be knit. It‚Äôs the first step in knitting. All you need is some yarn and needles.

What needles and yarn should you use?

I always recommend a chunky yarn and correspondingly thick needles for beginners because they‚Äôre much easier to grip. In this tutorial, I‚Äôm using Lion Brand‚Äôs Hometown USA and 8mm bamboo needles. 

You‚Äôll find tutorials and guides for making a Slipknot, Cast On, Knit Stitch and Cast Off. These techniques form a sturdy foundation in knitting.
