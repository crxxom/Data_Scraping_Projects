Do you remember how we built a stunning house for Disney Queen Elsa https://clck.ru/SakDu ? This house was beautiful! But it looks like Elsa needs a bigger castle! That’s why today we're going to make a huge magical house for her!

First of all, we need to make a good base for our multi-story house. The base and the roof are the most important part of any house. Therefore, we will put up the walls and cover the house with a roof. The sparkly stairs will connect the first and the second floor. By the way, Elsa's new house is a transformer-house! We can close it whenever we want! When all the main details are ready, we continue with the interior decorations. We're decorating our house in a winter style. It means, that all the furniture should be in cold colors. 

On the first floor, there will be a kitchen and a chic bathroom. And there's a cool garage for Elsa's new car! It's just awesome! On the second floor, there is a bedroom with a large and soft bed, a wardrobe, and a small balcony for gatherings on cozy evenings. On the third floor, there is another room with a baby's cradle. After all, someday Elsa may have a baby!

The last but not least - the Christmas tree! We're done! Come on and check out this magical house for a Disney queen Elsa! See you in 2021! Bye-bye!

Subscribe for more video recipes: http://goo.gl/MJV4af

Ingredients 

½ cup (115 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
½ cup (100 g) packed light brown sugar
½ cup (100 g) granulated sugar
1 large egg, at room temperature
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 ¼ cup (185 g) all-purpose flour
1 Tbsp (7.5 g) cornstarch
½ tsp (2.5 g) baking soda
½ tsp (2.5 g) salt
1 ½ cup (262 g) chocolate chips
1 cup (100 g) lightly toasted, coarsely chopped pecans (optional)

Directions

1. Cream the butter with the brown sugar and granulated sugar together well. Beat in the egg and the vanilla.

2. In a separate bowl, sift the flour with the cornstarch, baking soda and salt. Add this to the butter mixture and stir until blended. Stir in the chocolate chips and pecans (if using).

3. Using a small ice cream scoop or a tablespoon, scoop spoonfuls of dough (about 2 Tbsp) shape them into a ball and place onto a parchment lined baking tray or a plate. Chill the scooped cookies for at least an hour, or once chilled, the cookies can be frozen for baking later.

4. Preheat the oven to 325ºF (162 C). Arrange the chilled scooped cookies onto parchment-lined baking trays, leaving 3 inches between the cookies. Bake for 15-18 minutes, until browned around the edges. Cool the cookies on the baking tray. If baking cookie dough that has been frozen, arrange the frozen cookies on the baking tray and let them thaw for 20 minutes at room temperature before baking as above.

Let cool slightly and enjoy.

5-Minute Pasta Aglio E Olio: https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/recipes/2017/5/4/aglioeolio

50-Minute Fettuccine Alfredo:

FRESH FETTUCCINE:
3 large eggs, beaten to blend
2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
1 splash olive oil
1 pinch salt

1. Mix flour, eggs, olive oil, and salt with a fork or a bench scraper.
2. Knead until smooth, roughly 10 minutes, or use a dough hook attachment in a stand mixer to knead until smooth.
3. Cover with plastic wrap and rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.
4. Cut into quarters, then roll out with a flour-dusted rolling pin.
5. Run through a pasta machine, starting at a 0 setting and incrementing up to a 6 or a 7 setting, cutting the sheet in half if the pasta gets long.
6. Switch to a fettuccine cutting attachment and run the pasta sheets through. Dust noodles with flour, twist into nests, and cover until ready to cook.

You like carrots or not you will like this carrot cake. It's soft and moist, you don't really taste carrot in it. The orange flavour goes very well with it, This is my own recipe and this is how I like my carrot cake. but if you want to use vanilla, cinnamon, or almond you certainly can.

Check out the full series: https://sheepandstitch.com/how-to-knit/

In this video, I’ll show you how to cast on knitting like a pro! This is the thumb method cast on. If you have no idea what that means - no worries! Just know that it’s an easy and super useful cast on that both beginners and old hands use all the time.

So, you’ve got needles and a ball of yarn. Cool! Now you want to knit something. But how do you get the yarn onto your needles? 

Say hello to the cast on! 

Casting on is a way to turn loose yarn into neat stitches that can be knit. It’s the first step in knitting. All you need is some yarn and needles.

What needles and yarn should you use?

I always recommend a chunky yarn and correspondingly thick needles for beginners because they’re much easier to grip. In this tutorial, I’m using Lion Brand’s Hometown USA and 8mm bamboo needles. 

You’ll find tutorials and guides for making a Slipknot, Cast On, Knit Stitch and Cast Off. These techniques form a sturdy foundation in knitting.

I know it's easy to compare yourself to others' before & after pictures. These photos set expectations about how YOUR body could possibly look and even have the power to influence your diet & exercise routines. I wanted to show you how easy it is to be tricked by them.

With carefully chosen angles and clothing placement, you can literally take a convincing before & after photos within minutes of each other. So PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE be careful with who you trust, especially online! And remember, the best person to compare yourself to is who you were yesterday ❤️",7169429,410070,2341,PT57S
