There are different ways for a veterinarian to aspirate a lipoma, but in all cases, the dog does not seem to react or notice. Typically, the needle is very small—often the size that is used for canine vaccinations.

WARNING—Graphic video:  If procedures that use needles are upsetting, please skip this video.

On this episode of Breaking Trail, Coyote is stung by an infamous COW KILLER…the Velvet Ant!

The Velvet Ant, which is actually a species of wingless wasp, is well known for possessing one of the most painful stings in the insect kingdom.

Now the cow killing part is simply a myth but in his quest to work all the way up the insect sting pain index to the most painful sting on record, which is that of the Bullet Ant, Coyote has decided he better find out just how bad the number four ranked Velvet Ant is first.

On this episode of Breaking Trail, Coyote gets stung by a terrifying Tarantula Hawk! 

Boasting the world’s 2nd most painful sting, the Tarantula Hawk also happens to be the largest species of wasp in North America! These enormous spider wasps are most notorious for their macabre breeding habits but are also becoming well known for their ranking on the insect sting pain index.

This African elephant is on the verge of death. It was likely tusked in its side by another male elephant during a fight. What happens next reveals how enormously important an elephant is to its ecosystem. Elephants arrive on the scene to mourn the loss of their fellow elephant. The mourning process includes “body-mounting,” in which they climb on the carcass. They also mourn by walking backwards towards the body, often touching it with their hind foot. They will explore the body with their trunks and front feet. Whether elephants culturally transmit and learn these actions is part of an ongoing study. Hyenas arrived overnight and opened the belly of the carcass, tearing through the tough elephant hide. This gives the opportunity for white-backed vultures to feed.

Vultures don’t have strong enough beaks to tear through the elephant's hide, so they have to wait in line behind the hyenas. While sad, these deaths are crucial for ecosystems. These feasts can be life saving for vultures, whose populations have plummeted worldwide as humans have changed their habitats and poisoned them. A leopard comes to investigate but decides to eat elsewhere. Elephant carcasses briefly become busy ecosystems of their own. Apart from scavenging, there’s a full community of decomposers like maggots that chow down on anything the bigger scavengers don’t get to quickly enough. A carcass site becomes soaked with blood and fluids that are released during decomposition, creating a fertile patch of ground as microbes release nutrients into the soil. 

Scientists use carcass counts for keeping tabs on elephant population health. So not only does this elephant's carcass provide a highly beneficial service to the surrounding ecosystem ... it may ultimately help with science and elephant conservation.

Wildlife biologist Liz Bonnin goes on a journey of discovery to find out the science behind unusual interactions in the animal kingdom. Some of the surprising associations include a polar bear befriending huskies, a cat mothering ducklings, and an orangutan who keeps a pet dog. These odd pairings are not just limited to different species; animal relationships with humans are also explored, as people have been known to keep exotic pets such as lions, hippos and buffalos. Bonnin investigates the root of the affectionate connections and tries to uncover the reasons for the behaviours. 
Some people have sought out unusual, and even potentially dangerous relationships, with some very surprising animals.""

如何幫野馬釘蹄鐵：https://youtu.be/b4YMpbDLOPU

釘掌，就是給牲畜釘上蹄鐵以利行走。據文獻記載，中國在2000多年前就發明了蹄鐵術。曾有“無鐵即無蹄 無蹄即無馬”的說法。

哈嘍大家好
本頻道記錄中國傳統修蹄釘掌這項“非物質文化”。
過去，釘掌需要拜師學藝，學習幾年時間才出徒。不但學會打鐵學會釘掌，還要學會給牲口“看相”，有的牲口烈性、咬人、踢人、頂人，稍不小心就會受傷，需要倍加小心或採取相應措施。

現在，隨著機械化的發展，牲畜逐漸被機器代替，釘掌的活計越來越少，本頻道將會向大家分享傳統修蹄手藝，讓中國的文化在YouTuBe這個平台弘揚。

非常感謝！

So enjoy this super cute, fun video of these #dachshunds competing against each other in various sport competitions.

And of course, all dogs were safe and comfortable in everything we did. Oakley loves swimming (and jumping in the water), and Daphne too is a swimmer. Crusoe is not as much a fan of being in the water so he decided not to race that one! 

But the dogs go through 7 different doggy competitions, including:
- Swimming
- Weight Lifting
- Fencing (yes, dogs fencing)
- High Dive
- Long Jump
- Wrestling
- Running

Enjoy and let us know your favorite moment from the episode in the comments!
