The Velvet Ant, which is actually a species of wingless wasp, is well known for possessing one of the most painful stings in the insect kingdom.

This African elephant is on the verge of death. It was likely tusked in its side by another male elephant during a fight. What happens next reveals how enormously important an elephant is to its ecosystem. Elephants arrive on the scene to mourn the loss of their fellow elephant. The mourning process includes ‚Äúbody-mounting,‚Äù in which they climb on the carcass. They also mourn by walking backwards towards the body, often touching it with their hind foot. They will explore the body with their trunks and front feet. Whether elephants culturally transmit and learn these actions is part of an ongoing study. Hyenas arrived overnight and opened the belly of the carcass, tearing through the tough elephant hide. This gives the opportunity for white-backed vultures to feed.

Vultures don‚Äôt have strong enough beaks to tear through the elephant's hide, so they have to wait in line behind the hyenas. While sad, these deaths are crucial for ecosystems. These feasts can be life saving for vultures, whose populations have plummeted worldwide as humans have changed their habitats and poisoned them. A leopard comes to investigate but decides to eat elsewhere. Elephant carcasses briefly become busy ecosystems of their own. Apart from scavenging, there‚Äôs a full community of decomposers like maggots that chow down on anything the bigger scavengers don‚Äôt get to quickly enough. A carcass site becomes soaked with blood and fluids that are released during decomposition, creating a fertile patch of ground as microbes release nutrients into the soil. 

Scientists use carcass counts for keeping tabs on elephant population health. So not only does this elephant's carcass provide a highly beneficial service to the surrounding ecosystem ... it may ultimately help with science and elephant conservation.

Wildlife biologist Liz Bonnin goes on a journey of discovery to find out the science behind unusual interactions in the animal kingdom. Some of the surprising associations include a polar bear befriending huskies, a cat mothering ducklings, and an orangutan who keeps a pet dog. These odd pairings are not just limited to different species; animal relationships with humans are also explored, as people have been known to keep exotic pets such as lions, hippos and buffalos. Bonnin investigates the root of the affectionate connections and tries to uncover the reasons for the behaviours. 
Some people have sought out unusual, and even potentially dangerous relationships, with some very surprising animals.""

So enjoy this super cute, fun video of these #dachshunds competing against each other in various sport competitions.

And of course, all dogs were safe and comfortable in everything we did. Oakley loves swimming (and jumping in the water), and Daphne too is a swimmer. Crusoe is not as much a fan of being in the water so he decided not to race that one! 

But the dogs go through 7 different doggy competitions, including:
- Swimming
- Weight Lifting
- Fencing (yes, dogs fencing)
- High Dive
- Long Jump
- Wrestling
- Running

Enjoy and let us know your favorite moment from the episode in the comments!
