Our knowledge of the brain is evolving at a breathtaking pace, and Dr. Lara Boyd is positioned at the cutting edge of these discoveries. In 2006, she was recruited by the University of British Columbia to become the Canada Research Chair in Neurobiology and Motor Learning. Since that time she has established the Brain Behaviour Lab, recruited and trained over 40 graduate students, published more than 80 papers and been awarded over $5 million in funding. 

Dr. Boyd’s efforts are leading to the development of novel, and more effective, therapeutics for individuals with brain damage, but they are also shedding light on broader applications. By learning new concepts, taking advantage of opportunities, and participating in new activities, you are physically changing who you are, and opening up a world of endless possibility.

Transcript: 
Have you ever wondered what would happen if you actually sat down with missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints? 
Well, the answer depends on you. What do you want to talk about? 
Maybe you want a closer relationship with God, or maybe you’re really interested in the teachings of Jesus Christ. 
Or maybe you’re just curious about our beliefs. 
Whatever the reason, here’s what to expect. 
After you make a request online, two missionaries will reach out with a text, an email, or a phone call.
About us: We’re unpaid volunteers who come from all over the world. 
We take up to two years out of our lives to serve people and share the message of Jesus Christ. 
They’ll contact you to set up a visit that fits your schedule. 
Usually, it’s between 15 minutes and half an hour. 
It can be online, in your home, at church, or even in a public place. 
Then, the visit usually goes something like this:  
If you’re OK with it, we would usually start with a prayer. 
Then if you requested an item, we’ll give it to you, then share a quick message. 
If you told us beforehand you want to discuss a specific topic, we’ll come prepared to discuss it. 
And if you want to discuss something different, that’s completely fine. It’s your call. 
When we’re finished, we’ll ask you if you’d like another visit. 
If you say yes, great, we’ll set something up. If not, we’ll be on our way. 
And, that’s about it. Of course, every visit is different, but those are the basics. 
So, at a minimum, you have a nice conversation about God.  
But lots of people end up getting more out of it. You may be one of them. 
Only one way to find out!",26846495,3866,709,PT1M35S

Learn why rainfall is an essential part of each flowering. And every small step – part of the journey to the highest peek. The hindrances along the way to self-discovery and personal growth are easy to overcome. Learn how from his talk. For more than 30 years, Master Shi Heng Yi has been studying and practicing the interaction between mind and body. His strength is the ability to smoothly combine this knowledge with physical exercises and to practice Martial art –Kung Fu and Qi Gong. He has an academic background but he prefers to live at the Shaolin Temple Europe, Monastery located in Otterberg, Germany. Since 2010 he has been taking care of the settlement and he personifies the sustainable development and spreading the Shaolin culture and philosophy. As a contemporary monk, Master Yi holds a smartphone in the folds of his clothes as he sees no contradiction between living together with ancient knowledge and high technology. “The universal law of being successful and happy at the same time means finding the balance”, says master Yi.  And as for flying – yes, he really can do it! He only needs a stick and a little space. We expect him to fly-in and share about the Shaolin way at TEDxVitosha 2020.

In five eyebrow-raising findings, Burnett offers simple but life-changing advice on designing the life you want, whether you are contemplating college or retirement. 

After years of drawing cars and airplanes under his Grandmother’s sewing machine, Bill Burnett went to college where he discovered that there were people in the world who did this kind of thing every day (without the sewing machine), and they were called designers. Thirty years, five companies, and a couple thousand students later, Burnett is still drawing and building things, teaching others how to do the same, and quietly enjoying the fact that no one has discovered that he is having too much fun. As Executive Director of the Design Program at Stanford, he runs undergraduate and graduate programs in design, both interdepartmental programs between the mechanical engineering and art departments. Burnett worked on design of the award-winning Apple PowerBooks and the original Hasbro Star Wars action figures. He holds a number of mechanical and design patents.

Christian Dance | ""Praise God With an Undivided Heart"" | Praise Song
Pre-verse 1
We gather to eat, drink, enjoy God’s words,
and we receive the Holy Spirit’s work.

Verse 1
We think of God, pray-read, have fellowship,
and we meditate, ponder, and seek God.
Living in God’s words, we see He is lovely.
The truth frees us; we taste God’s real love.
Church life is great; praise takes many forms.
We can’t help but sing and dance in God’s praise.
There are no rules or restraints in our praise.
Sincere praise makes us joyful always.

Chorus
Life in God’s presence brings true happiness,
we will love and obey God forever.
Seeing the greatness of God’s salvation,
we praise God with an undivided heart.

Pre-verse 2
We fellowship truth, gain Holy Spirit’s work,
we share experiences, our life grows.

Verse 2
We are all the people of God’s kingdom,
and we all possess true hearts that love Him.
We perform our duty with one mind, heart,
and we see God’s blessings and leadership.
Judgment cleanses us, we see God is righteous.
We cast off our corruption, made anew.
We live out the likeness of honest men.
It’s kingdom’s life to worship God in spirit and truth.

Chorus
Life in God’s presence brings true happiness,
we will love and obey God forever.
Seeing the greatness of God’s salvation,
we praise God with an undivided heart.

Pre-verse 3
Brothers, sisters gather together,
we have gone through so many ups and downs.

Verse 3
The government’s suppression is so vile,
persecution and hardships we’ve suffered.
Nothing has ever shaken our resolve.
This is due to the guidance of God’s words.
The painstaking price which God has paid
for our salvation cannot be measured.
God lives amongst us, guiding us always.
This beautiful time, life, are so treasured.

Chorus
Life in God’s presence brings true happiness,
we will love and obey God forever.
Seeing the greatness of God’s salvation,
we praise God with an undivided heart.
Life in God’s presence brings true happiness,
we will love and obey God forever.
Seeing the greatness of God’s salvation,
we praise God with an undivided heart,
we praise God with an undivided heart,
we praise God with an undivided heart.

With light vim and pure talent, he demonstrates his unique playing style, which is notably a development of the Travis picking technique and blending of rhythm and melody. 

In his career, he's played on recordings for Air Supply and Men at Work and in his twenties he joined one of Australia's biggest rock acts, Dragon. Now, as a two-time Grammy nominee with a career spanning five decades, he has, for several years, performed over 300 concerts annually. He's worked with Martin Taylor on a jazz-inspired duet album The Colonel and the Governor. His most recent original material is Little By Little (2011).

Christian Movie Based True Stories｜""It's Good to Believe in God""｜God Guided Her to Find a Happy Life

To earn enough money to live a good life, Ding Ruilin and her husband put in bitterly hard work to open and run a business. But, thanks to the CCP government's exploitation and abuse, they remain heavily in debt, and have no choice but to go abroad to work. To make more money, Ding Ruilin takes on two jobs. The heavy burden of her work and the indifference of the people around her make her realize the pain and helplessness of living for money. In the midst of her pain and confusion, she meets high school classmate Lin Zhixin. In their talks, Ding Ruilin sees that Lin Zhixin has come to understand many things because of her faith in God. With God's presence, she feels spiritual peace and happiness and lives in a relaxed, easy state, which makes Ding Ruilin want to believe in God as well. Soon, to make even more money, Ding Ruilin and her husband take over a restaurant, but long-term fatigue causes Ding Ruilin to become seriously ill, which in turn leaves her at risk of paralysis. The torment of her illness makes Ding Ruilin begin to reflect on life. What should people live for? Is it worth sacrificing your life for wealth and fame? Can money help people escape emptiness and misery? Can it save people from death? Through her sisters' fellowship on God's word, Ding Ruilin is able to clearly see the answers to these questions about life, she learns about the most important thing to pursue in life, and she finally finds spiritual release. Through the guidance in God's word, Ding Ruilin finally discovers happiness in life …

Dr. Crum says the biggest game changer is “YOU, by harnessing the power of your mind."" She explores scientific results that show the influence of the mindset on the body, and how changing the subjective mindset produced different outcomes. Dr. Crum's work is inspired in part by the placebo effect, and has implications that stretch far beyond the realm of medicine.

Dr. Crum is a professor, psychologist, and researcher investigating how mindsets affect health and behavior. 

Dr. Crum's research focuses on how changes in subjective mindsets—the lenses through which information is perceived, organized, and interpreted—can alter objective reality through behavioral, psychological, and physiological mechanisms. Her work is, in part, inspired by research on the placebo effect, a notable and consistent demonstration of the ability of the mindset to elicit healing properties in the body. She is interested in understanding how mindsets affect important outcomes outside the realm of medicine, in the domains of behavioral health and organizational behavior.

#山上敬拜山下服侍​ #worshipcommunity​ #記住訂閱頻道緊貼最新詩歌呀​

參考經文：馬太福音 六 9-13

9所以，你們禱告要這樣說：
我們在天上的父：
願人都尊你的名為聖。
10願你的國降臨；
願你的旨意行在地上，
如同行在天上。
11我們日用的飲食，今日賜給我們。
12免我們的債，
如同我們免了人的債。
13不叫我們遇見試探；
救我們脫離凶惡 。
因為國度、權柄、榮耀，全是祢的，
直到永遠。阿們
_______

詩歌導想：
還記得初信時，我們都害怕禱告，特別是公開場合的禱告，總覺得自己的詞彙簡陋、不修邊幅，並很羨慕身邊的兄姊那些砌詞優雅、如流水般的禱文。慢慢，我們也學會了那些聽起來「屬靈」的字句，才發現滿口屬靈措辭和滿心真誠的信服，可以是兩碼子的事。

「你們禱告，不要反反覆覆說同樣的話，好像列國的世人一樣，他們以為話說得多就蒙垂聽。」（太六7） 主耶穌提醒我們，禱告最要緊的地方，不是禱文，而是認清那位信實、聽禱告的天父。「你們沒有祈求以先，你們所需用的，你們的父早已知道了。」（太六8）。 祂是會留心我們、聽我們禱告的天父，祂是我們平安的源頭，也是我們值得信靠順服的對象。今天，願你我在禱告時，讚頌祂的名，思想祂的信實，聆聽祂慈愛的聲音。

TWS簡介：「敬拜者使團」(The Worshipers) 自1994年成立，現為「同心圓」旗下的敬拜音樂團隊，多年來致力創作適用於教會的敬拜及經文詩歌超過二百首，包括「獻給我天上的主」、 「求主興起禱告的心」、 「不要憂慮」 、「主禱文」、「萬有都歸祢」等。使團亦藉著培靈佈道及敬拜訓練，與本地及海外眾教會攜手，使萬民作主門徒。我們深信敬拜不止於音樂，信仰亦並非為了滿足個人，更是連於社群。因此在個人經歷了敬拜的恩典後，我們更深切希望信徒能走入社區，服侍社會上有需要的群體，效法基督捨己精神，開展「山上敬拜、山下服侍」的信仰生命！

參考經文：太6:24-33

24 「一個人不能事奉兩個主。不是惡這個愛那個，就是重這個輕那個。你們不能又事奉神，又事奉瑪門。
25 「所以我告訴你們：不要為生命憂慮吃甚麼，喝甚麼；為身體憂慮穿甚麼。生命不勝於飲食嗎？身體不勝於衣裳嗎？ 26 你們看那天上的飛鳥，也不種，也不收，也不積蓄在倉裏，你們的天父尚且養活牠。你們不比飛鳥貴重得多嗎？ 27 你們哪一個能用思慮使壽數多加一刻呢？

28 「何必為衣裳憂慮呢？你想，野地裏的百合花怎麼長起來。它也不勞苦，也不紡線。 29 然而我告訴你們：就是所羅門極榮華的時候，他所穿戴的還不如這花一朵呢！ 30 你們這小信的人哪！野地裏的草今天還在，明天就丟在爐裏，神還給它這樣的妝飾，何況你們呢！

31 「所以，不要憂慮說：『吃甚麼？喝甚麼？穿甚麼？』 32 這都是外邦人所求的。你們需用的這一切東西，你們的天父是知道的。 33 你們要先求他的國和他的義，這些東西都要加給你們了。 34 所以，不要為明天憂慮，因為明天自有明天的憂慮；一天的難處一天當就夠了。」

TWS簡介：「敬拜者使團」(The Worshipers) 自1994年成立，現為「同心圓」旗下的敬拜音樂團隊，多年來致力創作適用於教會的敬拜及經文詩歌超過二百首，包括「獻給我天上的主」、 「求主興起禱告的心」、 「不要憂慮」 、「主禱文」、「萬有都歸祢」等。使團亦藉著培靈佈道及敬拜訓練，與本地及海外眾教會攜手，使萬民作主門徒。我們深信敬拜不止於音樂，信仰亦並非為了滿足個人，更是連於社群。因此在個人經歷了敬拜的恩典後，我們更深切希望信徒能走入社區，服侍社會上有需要的群體，效法基督捨己精神，開展「山上敬拜、山下服侍」的信仰生命！

Christian Family Movie ""A Mother's Love"" | How to Lead Your Child to the Right Path of Life

A Mother's Love is a Christian family movie that examines the subject of how to raise children. ""Knowledge can change your fate"" and ""The son becomes a dragon, the daughter becomes a phoenix"" are the hopes that nearly all parents have for their children. To ensure that her daughter Jiarui is able to pass her university entrance exams and test into a good university, Xu Wenhui decides to retire from her job as a sales director to accompany Jiarui as she studies to retake her tests. Xu Wenhui's high-pressure teaching methods and the competitive stress of the college entrance examinations drive her daughter to collapse, and nearly to desperation. Xu Wenhui feels deep remorse over this: She thought that everything she did was for her daughter's benefit, but instead, she only caused her daughter pain and hurt…. This is when her old classmate Fang Xinping preaches God's gospel to her. Through reading God's word, Xu Wenhui finally understands why pursuing ideals like ""Knowledge can change your fate"" will only hurt herself and her child, and comes to understand how to educate her daughter in a way that expresses real love …

Is 26% proficiency in math acceptable to you?  That's the question teacher and Synergy Academies Founder Dr. Randy Palisoc asks the TEDxManhattanBeach audience.  With only 26% of U.S. twelfth graders proficient in mathematics, Randy shares his solution: teach math as a language. Putting words back into math lessons enables even the youngest school-age minds to grasp complex concepts, such as fractions, that are traditionally thought of as abstract and difficult to understand.  In his stunningly simple and effective approach, math no longer creates problems for kids but solves them.

Randy Palisoc is a passionate educator, known for making math easy.  A founder of the five-time national award winning Synergy Academies, Randy is proud to identify Synergy as an “in spite of” school.  In spite of the fact that its students were disadvantaged and in spite of the fact that it did not have its own facility and had to pack up its classrooms every single week, his school was the first and only elementary school in South Los Angeles to ever win the National Blue Ribbon Award, and was named the #1 Urban Elementary School in America in 2013.

Seeking a broader impact, Randy left Synergy this year to start Ironbox Education.  One of the ways he believes we can dramatically improve America’s schools is by doing a better job teaching math to our students in a way that makes sense to them.  Randy believes implementing a few changes in the way we approach math will give students the confidence and thinking skills to be more competitive in a global economy.

Favorite TED Talk:  “My Invention That Made Peace With Lions”: Richard Turere

The “Game Changer” he most admires is Steve Jobs, because he had the ability to envision things we did not even know we needed or wanted.


About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",3203915,91449,3920,PT8M55S
