4,4l8bs_fU78w,Education,27,Happy Fish Swim School,Baby Swimming: Happy Fish Swim School,2014-07-24T08:27:52Z,"Baby swimming is something new to many parents in Singapore. The trend is growing and more people are receptive to the idea of letting babies to swim in recent years.

Baby swimming lesson is designed for babies from 4 months to 2 years old. Babies will learn how to enter water safely, hold their breath when they go underwater, turn and propel themselves to the side of the pool and finally get out of the pool safely. 

Besides, research shows early swimming helps baby in growing sense of self-esteem, confidence and independence. Swimming also provides very good stimulation to baby brain development.

Again, please do not attempt without proper swimming lessons

This video is teaching preschoolers about fruits which include orange, watermelon, persimmon, mango, pomegranate and cantaloupe.
These colorful velcro toys playset is educational and fun for toddlers and young children to play. Children can learn fruits, and also learn how to separate the pieces apart and put them together as well.

The velcro toys playset we bought was affordable. My boy has been playing with these almost everyday. He can identify most of the fruit we have shown on the video, eg. like apple, orange, guava now. We are really happy he's learning a bit by bit everyday.

The Incredible Japanese Prison Break

Aomori, Japan. 1936. Prisoner Yoshie Shiratori had had enough. He was forced to confess to a murder he did not commit, falsely imprisoned in Aomori Prison, beaten and tortured every night by prison guards, and, now worse, prosecutors were seeking the death penalty. In his mind, it was time to go; but Aomori Prison wasn’t the easiest to escape. Regardless, Yoshie Shiratori had nothing to lose, and so at 5:30 am he made his move. 

He knew there would be a 15 minute gap in the patrol time as he had studied the guards’ routine for months; and when the coast was clear, he pulled out a metal wire (which he had smuggled in from the bathhouse) and started to pick the lock. His hands were stiff from the wintry cold, but after a few minutes of picking, he had success, and his cell door swung open. 

But he wasn’t out of the woods yet, because there were more locked doors ahead. He knew he only had a few minutes left before the guards would return, and so he wasted no time attempting to pick his way through the remaining security doors. 

Now fortunately for him, he was able to make it out of the facility, but the bad news was that he was only halfway to freedom. You see, he was still well within the search perimeter, which meant at any moment the alarm could go off and he’d still be caught...",30930190,745420,50698,PT25M3S

Produced by: UNICEF, India - Video in हिन्दी - मानक हिन्दी - Mānak Hindī - Hindi

All faeces, including those of babies and young children, should be disposed of safely.

These videos focus on social and behaviour change communication and are made for individual and small group viewing, learning and discussion. They are designed to be used as interpersonal communication tools by communities and frontline workers in giving out important information to women and caregivers.

Key Messages
----------------------

Having a toilet at home and making sure that everyone uses it including children, is the best way to dispose of faeces and avoid illnesses.

If you do not have a toilet or a latrine in your house then ensure that you and your family defecate well away from houses, walking paths, water sources and places where children play.

After defecation by a child, cover the faeces with mud immediately.

Discussions and Frequently Asked Questions
------------------------------------------------------------------

What are the benefits of having a toilet at home?

Key Response: It is the best way to dispose of faeces and avoid illnesses- including for children. You have privacy and it is available 24 hours a day.

A baby's faeces is harmless.

Key Response: This is not true. All faeces, including those of newborns, babies and young children, carry germs and are dangerous. These germs can get transferred onto utensils, hands, or in the water you drink, causing illness in your whole family.

Having a toilet at home is very beneficial for women.

Key Response: They have privacy, it is available at all times, they don't need someone to go to the field with, there are no snakes or scorpions, and it is healthier because women don't need to hold back and go when there is an appropriate time -- as going in the field.

F-diagram/ Faecal-oral route that causes Polio and diarrhoea.

When we defecate in the open, flies sit on the faeces and then transmit the germs and bacteria to us by sitting on food items in our houses. Also, when we defecate in the open, our feet become dirty and we end up carrying the germs back home with ourselves. And through our hands, utensils and food these enter our systems and cause severe complications. That is why, we must always use a toilet.

How Would You Escape North Korea? (The 7 Choices)

If you were living in North Korea right now - trying to survive on a diet of rats, grass, soil and tree bark; quenching your thirst by drinking out of mud puddles in the ground - what would you do?

There's also the conceivable chance of being sent to a political prison camp for years on end just because you innocently thought out loud one day to a bunch of friends that, say, Dear Leader gained a bit of weight; where you are then beaten, tortured, and left so hungry that you are forced to dig and consume the grains out of faeces, or the maggots from dead bodies, just so you have the energy to perhaps last one more day.

You'd probably wanna escape. But how?

The North Korean government in Pyongyang refuses to let its citizens leave, a clear violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, viewing North Korean defectors as traitorous criminals. Captured North Koreans would be subject to unimaginable torture and often public executions.

If they are successful in their escape, then three to four generations of their family back home would be sent to North Korean prison camps to rot ....or worse. This is a strong deterrent.

But this still doesn't stop desperate North Koreans from tempting fate. In this video, I'll go over the seven ways to escape the DPRK, including the most dangerous, the most unforgiving, the most unique, and the most unexpected.

The North Korean border on the south side (ie. South Korean border / Korean DMZ) is the shortest distance to travel for safety and stability but as a result, the regime makes it dangerously hard. A North Korean escapee can be shot down by North Korean soldiers (border guards) or step on the many landmines in the area.

The northern border to China has its own set of challenges. Most North Korean refugees escape through this way, usually crossing the Tumen River border (like the famous North Korean defector Hyeonseo Lee). Once in China, the nightmare doesn't end there.

There are also other, more unconventional ways you can try to escape such as through North Korean labor camps.

Even if you make it to safety and resettle in a stable country, the North Korean regime will still try to hunt you down, so you're never truly safe. Especially if you're an outspoken critic or a threat to Kim Jong-un's power - just ask his half brother, Kim Jong-nam.

Produced by: UNICEF, India - Video in हिन्दी - मानक हिन्दी - Mānak Hindī - Hindi

Know that unhygienic menstrual practices can cause reproductive tract infections among adolescent girls and women.

These videos focus on social and behaviour change communication and are made for individual and small group viewing, learning and discussion. They are designed to be used as interpersonal communication tools by communities and frontline workers in giving out important information to women and caregivers.

Key Messages
----------------------

You should follow hygienic practices during menstruation. Not doing so can result in you getting fungal infections. Repeated infections lead to serious reproductive tract infections and can cause infertility in the long term.

You should bathe regularly, use clean and dry feminine hygiene products such as cloth or sanitary napkins and change them regularly during menstruation. If you are using cloth it is important that you regularly wash them with soap and water and dry them completely in the sun before use as damp clothing can carry germs that can lead to infections.

The school that your daughter goes to should have separate, safe latrines for girls and boys. The girls' latrine in particular needs access to water and soap so girls can appropriately clean themselves during menstruation and there should also be provisions for girls' sanitary napkins to be disposed of in a refuse pit or collected and burned.

Discussions and Frequently Asked Questions
------------------------------------------------------------------

It is important to let our young girls know about these hygienic practices which can help them stay healthy

Key Response: Hygiene is very important during menstruation. Shyness prevents us from letting them know the proper hygiene practices. It is our duty to take care of our girls. If we need more information we should consult the ANM, ASHA or AWW.

How to keep cloth napkins clean?

Key Response: Do not use a wet or damp cloth. Always wash it with soap and water and dry it well in sunlight.

Is there anything else we can do to help them during menstruation?

Key Response: Make sure there is a separate toilet for them in school, soap and water to wash themselves with, and provisions for girls' sanitary napkins to be disposed of in a refuse pit or collected and burned. Since there is a loss of blood- girls can be given extra iron rich foods (or iron tablets) at this time to help make up for the loss and prevent anaemia.

How Would You Take Down North Korea? (The 7 Choices)

If you were put in charge of one mission - to take down the North Korean regime - a mission that had previously left world leaders beaten and befuddled, where failure could result in changes to the political and physical landscape for generations to come….what would you do?

And time is of the essence here, as the longer you wait, the likelier it is for Dear Leader to complete development of nukes capable of reaching the continental US, or perhaps anywhere else in the world. Actually, according to some reports, it might already be too late.

But whether North Korea actually fires is another question altogether. If we are to rid the world of this nefarious regime - I’m talking the regime not the people - we have to consider the options. In this video, I’ll go over the seven ways to take down North Korea - including the most destructive, the most convenient, the most secretive, and the most unexpected....

The $1,000,000,000 North Korean Bank Heist

Bangladesh, February 7th, 2016. The director of the Bangladesh Central Bank got off the elevator on the ninth floor, and headed to the back office of the Accounts and Budgeting Department. This was the most restricted part of the building. He was there to deal with a problem, one that had been plaguing the office the last few days. 

You see, the printer wasn’t working, and this was kind of a big deal. It was causing a real disruption. 

The automated printer, which was hooked up to the bank’s software, was supposed to work round the clock, 24/7, printing out the bank’s transaction reports in real-time. Due to this technical glitch however, the printer tray remained empty. 

Much of the day was spent trying to fix the issue; and, after a great deal of effort, there was success. They were able to restart the printer. And so the backlog of transaction reports started rolling out, one by one. 

Now, it soon became apparent that something wasn’t quite right. There were more statements than expected...

This Is The Greatest Bank Heist in Japanese History

Tokyo. December 10th, 1968. It was pouring rain. The bank manager of the Nihon Trust bank was on edge. Someone had threatened his life and those around him over the past few months. 

Just four days prior, a letter (one of recent many) was sent to his personal residence demanding 300 million yen, or his house would be blown up with dynamite. The letter was made up of characters cut out and pasted from movie magazines. Police were notified, and indeed they kept a close eye on the bank and his home. Though this did not ease the mind of the bank manager who shared his concerns with his branch employees. 

Now of course, this is Japan, and work is work - the show must go on. With this in mind, the bank manager went on with his duties sending four of his employees to the nearby Toshiba factory to make a scheduled drop. So off they went taking the company car, but not long after leaving the bank the four heard police sirens approaching. At that very moment they happened to be next to a prison of all places. A police officer screeched to a halt in front of the car, and frantically got off his motorcycle to warn them...

Talking Points:
- Fake police officer
- Dynamite
- 1700 ATMs
- 7-Elevens
- Largest heist team ever
- Polite thank you note
- Cyanide
- Post-war Tokyo
- US occupation
- Dysentery outbreak

The Insane Hijacking of Japan Airlines Flight 351

Tokyo, March, 1970. 31,000 feet up in the air. Japan Airlines Flight 351 was reaching its cruising altitude. It had left Tokyo’s Haneda Airport no more than ten minutes ago, and was set to land in Fukuoka in an hour’s time. This was to be a relatively short flight, a domestic affair, but little did the passengers and crew know it was going to be neither, as Japan Airlines Flight 351 was about to undergo a harrowing ordeal. 

On the plane were 122 passengers: tourists, businessmen, first-year uni students, doctors on their way to medical conferences—people from all walks of life—and including a few notable individuals like the high-ranking Pepsi executive, the talented bass player from the up-and-coming rock band ‘Hadaka no Rariizu’, and the Roman Catholic priest from New York. This was a diverse mix, with people of varied experiences and professions, but nothing could have prepared them for what was to come. 

At about 7:30 am, as the plane was flying over the southern face of Mount Fuji, a young Japanese man got up from his seat to make a special announcement:

He was hijacking the plane...",8411764,243709,21641,PT21M8S

Meet Peppa Pig and her family:

Peppa Pig
Peppa Pig is a lovable but slightly bossy little pig. She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George. Peppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises.

George Pig
George is Peppa’s little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa – even when she’s being bossy. George’s favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can’t speak yet but can say one word very well: ‘Dine-saw!’

Mummy Pig
Mummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don’t bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things.

Daddy Pig
Daddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. Daddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can’t remember where he put his glasses.

Have fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: Suzy Sheep,Rebecca Rabbit,Danny Dog,Candy Cat,Pedro Pony,Zoe Zebra,Emily Elephant,Freddy Fox,Kylie Kangaroo,Wendy Wolf,Gabriella Goat,Gerald Giraffe,Molly Mole,Belinda Bear,Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda,Mandy Mouse,Simon Squirrel!

Be able to discuss the barriers and benefits of using contraceptive methods with the frontline worker.

These videos focus on social and behaviour change communication and are made for individual and small group viewing, learning and discussion. They are designed to be used as interpersonal communication tools by communities and frontline workers in giving out important information to women and caregivers.

Key Messages
----------------------

Using contraceptive methods has many benefits including having a healthier family.

Talking to your frontline health worker (ANM/ASHA) will help you better understand the various methods.

Discussions and Frequently Asked Questions
------------------------------------------------------------------

When should family planning be initiated?

Key Response: The best time to initiate family planning is immediately after marriage. But you can also start after the birth of the first child so the mother has adequate time to recover and give proper care and attention to first baby. Remember there are many safe and acceptable ways of avoiding pregnancy.

Who can I discuss such private issues with?

Key Response: Talking to your frontline health worker (ANM/ASHA) will help you better understand the various methods.

Where can I get contraception?

Key Response: Spacing methods are available at your nearest health centre, including oral contraceptive pills, condoms, IUCD.

Use of contraceptive can cause severe side effects and hamper pregnancy later.

Key Response: Contraceptive options like pills or Copper T are safe to use. Remember spacing births ensures the health and well-being of the entire family.
