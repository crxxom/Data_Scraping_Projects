0,f2mdMcf-fJs,Science & Technology,28,MihaiDesigns,Who says one nozzle is enough!? 3D printing with different nozzle sizes,2021-06-04T12:54:58Z,"Most people only 3D print with the stock 0.4mm nozzle that came with the printer. Like a camera that comes with a stock lens, there's a lot you can do with it, but there are other options that open up new possibilities.

Use smaller nozzles for tiny details and larger ones for quicker printing. Trouble is that plastic doesn't have enough time to melt, so the larger nozzles will have to be longer as well, with longer heating blocks.

New hotends are coming out every day with improved melting capabilities, optimized for higher temperatures, or with other cool tweaks. But E3D's open sourced V6 hotend is still one of the best in terms of value. They've then expanded the options to the Volcano and the SuperVolcano hotends for more and more throughput.

Larger nozzles do have a downside: they can't print small details. So it's not a one size fits all kind of scenario. It's a matter of using the right nozzle for the job. 3D printing is awesome!

This bit left a very clean cut that was filled with Total Boat 2:1 epoxy and some pure white Black Diamond Pigment.

I used a couple of pieces of blue painters tape to offset the touch off probe so it didn't potentially hit any new wood. Flattening this saves a lot of sanding as the epoxy is not easy to remove.

In the Arctic, enormous releases of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, threaten the climate.

Colossal explosions shake a remote corner of the Siberian tundra, leaving behind massive craters. In Alaska, a huge lake erupts with bubbles of inflammable gas. Scientists are discovering that these mystifying phenomena add up to a ticking time bomb, as long-frozen permafrost melts and releases vast amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. What are the implications of these dramatic developments in the Arctic? Scientists and local communities alike are struggling to grasp the scale of the methane threat and what it means for our climate future.

If successful, the Artemis program will perform the first crewed lunar landing mission since Apollo 17 in 1972, the final lunar flight of the Apollo program.
NASA's moonshot goal with Artemis is to return humans to the moon and create a sustained human presence on and around the lunar surface that will start with landing the first woman and the first person of color on the moon this decade.
The Lunar Gateway, or simply Gateway, is a planned small space station in lunar orbit intended to serve as a solar-powered communication hub, science laboratory, short-term habitation module for government-agency astronauts, as well as a holding area for rovers and other robots.
As this is an essential component from day one, it's being manufactured in advance and will be attached to the HALO module for launch in 2024. The second part of ESPRIT will contain additional fuel tanks, a windowed habitation corridor and docking ports. Currently it's scheduled for launch in 2027.
For crewed missions, astronauts will first fly to the Gateway using the NASA Orion spacecraft. Then, they will use a human lander to transfer the astronauts to the Moon's surface. NASA has selected the SpaceX Starship to act as the human lander ‚Äî although it remains untested for this purpose.
Orion is a partially reusable crewed spacecraft to be used in NASA's Artemis program. The spacecraft consists of a Crew Module space capsule designed by Lockheed Martin and the European Service Module manufactured by Airbus Defence and Space.

Its partners include Hilton, Marriott, and Walt Disney World Resorts, among others.¬†Clean the World has donated over 50 million bars of recycled soap to people in need in 127 countries since its founding in 2009. The organization has had to adapt as more hotel chains move away from single-use toiletries in favor of bulk offerings.

Hilton‚Äôs partnership with Clean the Word began in 2009, not 2019. The data presented in the video reflects the first seven months of the Clean the World Challenge ‚Äî a promise to donate 1 million bars of soap by October 15, 2019 (Global Handwashing Day). Insider regrets the error.

The story of quantum physics starts at the beginning of the 20th century with scientists trying to better understand how light bulbs work. This simple question soon led scientists deep into the hidden workings of matter, into the sub-atomic building blocks of the world around us.  Here they discovered phenomena unlike any encountered before - a realm where things can be in many places at once, where chance and probability call the shots and where reality appears to only truly exist when we observe it.

Albert Einstein hated the idea that nature, at its most fundamental level, is governed by chance. Jim reveals how in the 1930's, Einstein thought he'd found a fatal flaw in quantum physics. This was not taken seriously until it was tested in the 1960s. Professor Al-Khalili repeats this critical experiment, posing the question does reality really exist, or do we conjure it into existence by the act of observation?

Elsewhere, we explore how the most famous law of quantum physics ‚Äì The Uncertainty Principle ‚Äì is obeyed by plants and trees as they capture sunlight during the vital process of photosynthesis. Could quantum mechanics explain the greatest mystery in biology - evolution?

Project Sunroof uses information that‚Äôs in Google Maps to figure out how much sun falls on a roof and takes into account stuff like the angle of the roof, the weather, and obstructions like trees and chimneys. Then it uses those measurements to figure out how many panels you‚Äôd probably need and how much you could save on your electric bill, including solar incentives in your area. You can see how buying or leasing panels affects your savings, and then send your estimate to installers in your area, instantly.

Visit google.com/sunroof and enter your address to find out how much solar energy could save you. Project Sunroof works in Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Fresno. But anyone can sign up to find out when it expands to their neighborhood.",3051774,35839,1695,PT1M31S
