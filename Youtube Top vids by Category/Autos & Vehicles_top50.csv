Upon arrival, you’ll our service bays and highly trained Jiffy Lube technicians ready to service your bay. Depending on the size of the location and time of the day, the team could vary from three to seven employees.

Carefully follow the direction of the technician to pull your vehicle into the bay. Our technicians above and below get to work as soon as the car is stopped. The technician under the bay will drain fluids and replace the oil filter while other technicians get pushing checking your oil level, transmission fluid, differential fluid, transfer case fluid, power steering fluid, windshield washer fluid, and battery water. They’ll also give a look over your brake fluid levels, serpentine belts, wiper blades, antifreeze levels, engine and passenger air filters, headlights, and the chassis.

You’ll hear technicians above and below the bay calling out their progress to each other during the process. That’s to ensure the proper steps are taken to service your vehicle the right way.

Once your car is filled with fresh oil and all of your systems have been checked, a courtesy technician will wash exterior windows and vacuum the interior floorboards.

As we said, the Jiffy Lube Signature Service Oil Change isn’t just an oil change, it is preventive maintenance to keep your vehicle running smoothly. We help get you in and out quickly so you can take back your day and Leave Worry Behind.

New cars are becoming more expensive, and it is unlikely those cheap cars will ever be back.

Everybody knows that cars are about horsepower and torque!  But what does that even mean?  What is Horsepower?  What is Torque? We get into the nitty gritty of force- talkin’ ‘bout Torque and ft. lbs., and we build up to the triumphant power we measure with horses. It's Horsepower! ...did I need to say horsepower?  We explore the relationship between horsepower and torque.   You’ll find out what all those dyno numbers mean, and why diesel engines can make a bunch of torque, but not always as much horsepower as gas engines.  It’s FORCE!  It’s POWER! It’s HORSES!  It’s SCIENCE GARAGE!

It’s the first Maybach SUV and it starts from £150,000. But as you can imagine, once you chuck in a couple of options the price easily increases… And the one Mat’s reviewing costs £250,000!!

So what do you guys think - is this ultra-luxurious (and ultra-expensive) SUV the #1 posh SUV? Or are established names like the Bentayga & Cullinan still well ahead? Let us know in the comments!
