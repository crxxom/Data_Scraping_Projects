A Tampa woman who fought off an attacker at her apartment complex's gym is speaking out about her experience in the hopes that other women will feel more empowered.

Nashali Alma, 24, said she was exercising in her complex's gym, about 12 miles northwest of downtown Tampa, in late January when a man who looked familiar to her needed access to the gym, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office said.

Alma said she let the man in because she had seen him in the gym before. But as she was working out, Alma told investigators that the man approached her and grabbed her waist. Alma said she yelled at the man to get away from her but he kept chasing her around the gym, police said.

The Nordic countries seem to have it all figured out. Finland and Denmark have consistently topped the United Nations’ most prestigious index, The World Happiness Report, in all six areas of life satisfaction: income, healthy life expectancy, social support, freedom, trust and generosity.

Learn more about work-life balance secrets from the happiest countries in the world on CNBC Make It: https://cnb.cx/37So3YY

Each year, a group of happiness experts from around the globe rank 156 countries based on how “happy” citizens are, and they publish their findings in the World Happiness Report. Happiness might seem like an elusive concept to quantify, but there is a science to it.

When researchers talk about “happiness,” they’re referring to “satisfaction with the way one’s life is going,” Jeff Sachs, co-creator of the World Happiness Report and a professor at Columbia University, tells CNBC Make It.

“It’s not primarily a measure of whether one laughed or smiled yesterday, but how one feels about the course of one’s life,” he says.

Since the report began in 2012, Nordic countries — which include Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland, plus the Faroe Islands, Greenland and Aland — consistently turn up at the top of the list. (The United States, on the other hand, typically lands somewhere around 18th or 19th place.)

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: http://www.pbs.org/donate​.

In the 2018 documentary, Trump’s Showdown, filmmaker Michael Kirk and his team (America After 9/11, Bannon’s War) methodically reveal how an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election grew to threaten Donald Trump’s presidency. 

The film draws on more than 60 in-depth interviews with former heads of U.S. intelligence agencies, Trump insiders, attorneys, authors and journalists. Thousands of photographs and hundreds of hours of archival footage pull together the entire story – from the days just before Trump’s inauguration to the increasingly chaotic events that ensnared powerful members of Trump’s inner circle and threatened the president himself.

Manipur has been on the boil these days- cars have been torched, people have lost their lives, a curfew has been imposed and the army has been brought in. All because of a High Court order- to consider the plea of the Meitei community in Manipur to be included in the Scheduled Tribes of India. But the issue is not a new one. The Meiteis have long been demanding to be declared as STs and the other tribes of the state- the Nagas and the Kukus are determined to not let that happen. 
Why is that? Why do the Meiteis want the ST tag and why are the other tribes so dead against it?
In this video, we delve into history to find the roots of this conflict and also talk about how this has impacted the daily lives of the people in Manipur.

If we figure out how to harness that power here on earth, it would be a huge game-changer.

In October 2018, a Boeing 737 Max passenger jet crashed shortly after takeoff off the coast of Indonesia. Five months later, following an eerily similar flight pattern, another 737 Max 8 went down in Ethiopia. Everyone on board the flights died.

""Boeing's Fatal Flaw,"" a FRONTLINE documentary in collaboration with The New York Times, tells the inside story of what led up to the crashes — revealing how intense market pressure and failed oversight contributed to tragic deaths and a catastrophic crisis for one of the world’s most iconic industrial names.

FRONTLINE goes inside the crisis and places it in a fresh and provocative light — telling individual stories of addiction, but also investigating how the heroin epidemic as we know it came to be.

To make Chasing Heroin, Marcela Gaviria and her team, including correspondent Martin Smith, spent nearly a year tracing the lives of addicts like Kristina, who at age 21 is seven years into her heroin addiction and has been living on the streets for three; Johnny, who started using to cope with the breakup of his marriage; and Cari, a suburban mom who led a double life as a heroin dealer.

But in addition to these raw stories of addiction, the documentary investigates big pharma’s unprecedented push to popularize opioid painkillers like Oxycontin and explores how America is rethinking incarceration as a response to drug addiction.

35,GU87SH5e0eI,News & Politics,25,CNBC,Secretive Giant TSMC’s $100 Billion Plan To Fix The Chip Shortage,2021-10-16T16:46:24Z,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company makes 24% of all the world's chips, and 92% of the most advanced ones found in today's iPhones, fighter jets and supercomputers. Now TSMC is building America's first 5-nanometer fabrication plant, hoping to reverse a decades-long trend of the U.S. losing chip manufacturing to Asia. CNBC got an exclusive tour of the $12 billion fab that will start production in 2024.

As the world grapples with an ongoing chip shortage, a quiet giant among chipmakers has committed to investing $100 billion over three years to ramp up production.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company may not be a household name, but with a market value of over $550 billion, it’s one of the world’s 10 most valuable companies. Now, it’s leveraging its considerable resources to bring the world’s most advanced chip manufacturing back to U.S. soil.

CNBC got an exclusive tour of the $12 billion fabrication plant, or fab, in Phoenix, Arizona, where TSMC will start making 5-nanometer chips in 2024. The company says it will produce 20,000 wafers each month.

“These are parts that are going to be used in lots of different places: CPUs, GPUs, IPUs, etc. They’ll be used in smartphones,” Rick Cassidy told CNBC. Cassidy is TSMC’s chief strategy officer and the president and CEO of TSMC’s project in Arizona.

TSMC makes key components for everything from cellphones to F-35 fighter jets to NASA’s Perseverance Rover mission to Mars. Earlier this month, it announced plans for a new factory in Japan, where it will produce chips with older technologies, for things like household devices and certain car components. TSMC is also Apple’s exclusive provider of the most advanced chips inside every iPhone currently on the market and most Mac computers.

“But they remain sort of in the background, in terms of end markets. So Apple gets all the accolades when a new phone comes out,” said Joanne Itow, managing director of manufacturing at Semico Research.

“We’re low-key. We let our products speak for themselves. Their success brings all the business that we could ever hope for,” Cassidy said.

The U.S. was the birthplace of advanced silicon, but for decades now, it’s been losing market share to Asia, where 79% of the world’s chip production happened in 2020, according to industry association SEMI. It calculated the U.S. was responsible for 12% of worldwide chip manufacturing last year, down from 37% in 1990. 

TSMC alone was responsible for 24% of the world’s semiconductor output in 2020, up from 21% in 2019, according to the company. When it comes to the most advanced chips used in the latest iPhones, supercomputers and automotive AI, TSMC is responsible for 92% of production while Samsung is responsible for the other 8%, according to research group Capital Economics.

“It’s become almost a monopoly at the leading edge, and all of those manufacturing operations, for the most part, are out of Taiwan, Hsinchu. That becomes a matter of national importance for the United States, but not only the United States, but the Western world,” said Christopher Rolland, Susquehanna’s senior semiconductor analyst.

Along with cutting edge 3- and 5-nanometer chips, TSMC also makes larger chips for products such as electric toothbrushes and coffeemakers. Cars often use less-advanced 28- to 40-nanometer chips. All types of chips have been impacted by the shortage. Carmakers including GM and Toyota have paused production at some plants. And Apple is likely to slash its 2021 production targets for the iPhone 13, with orders for some models delayed by more than a month.

Where was Hulk during Avengers Infinity War? What does Hulk's loss tell us about the long arc of his character throughout all of the Marvel films -- The Incredible Hulk (2008), The Avengers (2012), Age of Ultron (2015), Thor Ragnarok (2017), Infinity War (2018), and Avengers Endgame (2019)? Could Bruce Banner evolve into ""Professor Hulk"" in Endgame? #Thanos #Hulk #Avengers

After a huge build up of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border, American officials say Moscow now has the capability to launch a major military operation, including an attack on the capital Kyiv. 

Moscow has practically encircled its smaller neighbour, with close to 130,000 troops.  It says they are carrying out training exercises and maintains no invasion is being planned.  

Diplomatic efforts are continuing to defuse the crisis.

There are Instagram accounts devoted to Costco, like @costcodeals, and websites, like CostcoInsider.com. Costco has even become a travel destination and - for one couple - a place to get married. Buying in bulk isn't for everyone, but Costco members love the wholesale club because it makes you feel like you're getting a good deal.

""Some of their customer base is absolutely addicted to Costco — absolutely addicted to the experience and the brands and the thrill of going to Costco,"" Patricia Hong, partner at the global management consulting firm A.T. Kearney, tells CNBC Make It. That's by design — inspiring obsession is all part of Costco's playbook. Here's how Costco gets you hooked.

It’s an environmental crisis that’s been in the making for nearly 70 years. Plastic pollution is now considered one of the largest environmental threats facing humans and animals globally.

In “The Plastic Problem: PBS NewsHour Presents”, Amna Nawaz and her PBS NewsHour colleagues look at this now ubiquitous material and how it’s impacting the world, why it’s become so prevalent, what’s being done to mitigate its use, and what potential alternatives or solutions are out there. This hour-long program travels from Boston to Seattle, Costa Rica to Easter Island to bring the global scale of the problem to light.

As the country’s central bank continues to pump billions of dollars into the financial system daily, who is benefiting and at what cost?

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: http://www.pbs.org/donate.

FRONTLINE investigates “The Power of the Fed” — and how the central bank’s actions have played out over the years on Wall Street versus Main Street — in a gripping new documentary. 

From the award-winning investigative team behind “Amazon Empire” and “The Facebook Dilemma,” the film traces how an experiment the Fed began after the 2008 crash has been dramatically changing the American economy — exploring criticisms that, while well-intentioned, the Fed’s efforts have contributed to wealth inequality, helped today’s financial world grow far removed from the real-world economy, and prompted fears of growing inflation and an impending crash.

The documentary is supported by The WNET Group’s Chasing the Dream, a public media initiative that examines poverty, justice and economic opportunity in America. 

The correspondent is James Jacoby. The writers and producers are Anya Bourg and James Jacoby. The co-producer is Megan Robertson. The senior producer is Frank Koughan. The executive producer is Raney Aronson-Rath.

This has left public health officials in Canada, the U.K. and the US

Five million Canadians still smoke. Could e-cigarettes help wean them over to a safer nicotine delivery device? Many ex-smokers say 'yes.' E-cigarettes are their salvation.

Health Canada is on the cusp of deciding how e-cigarettes should be regulated. Mark Kelly heads to England -- a country that has taken bold steps in embracing the e-cigarette as a safer alternative. Will Canada?  And what will this mean for our e-cigarette industry?

Until now, e-cigarettes with nicotine have not been endorsed by Health Canada. And that's kept Big Tobacco out of the Canadian market. Will new regulations open the doors for a tarred industry to join in the e-cigarette revolution?

49,za8FOavztZQ,News & Politics,25,CNBC Make It,Why You Spend So Much Money At Ikea,2019-10-05T14:00:56Z,"Ikea was founded in 1943 by a young Swedish man named Ingvar Kamprad. Today, there are 433 stores in 53 countries. The name Ikea comes from Ingvar's first and last initial, the farm he grew up on — Elmtaryd — and the village he lived near — Agunnaryd. Initially the company started by selling pencils and postcards. In 1948, it began selling furniture, and the rest is history. In fiscal year 2019, Ikea sold 7 million Billy bookcases, and brought in $45 billion in retail sales.

At the heart of Ikea's success is value: You know what you're going to get when you shop at Ikea, and it's going to be affordable.

In fact, price is so important to Ikea's strategy that the company first decides on the price of a piece of furniture and then reverse engineers the construction, the company says.

Ikea has a ""democratic design approach,"" according to Antonella Pucarelli, the chief commercial officer of Ikea retail U.S., which means that it ""deliver[s] form, function and quality products at a low price. Even though our products are affordable, we don't compromise on quality,"" she says. (Ikea has had high profile recalls of millions of chests and dressers after several tipped over, killing children. In response, Ikea admitted the chests and dressers could be dangerous and offered free kits to anchor the chests and dressers to the wall, as well as refunds.)

Some of Ikea's furniture is made from wood, some is made from particleboard (recycled wood chips fused together), keeping production more affordable. Ikea furniture is shipped and sold in flat-packs, which makes transporting it cheaper, and customers put it together themselves (or pay for someone to do it for them), keeping labor costs down.

And the trademark simple style of the furniture Ikea sells is not just because it's a Scandinavian aesthetic. It's easier and cheaper to make affordable versions of such furniture look good.

""Ikea's aesthetic is pared down and minimal, which is not an accident. Uncomplicated forms with very little applied decoration are easier to manufacture. More can be produced in a shorter amount of time, increasing efficiency and decreasing production costs,"" Ashlie Broderic, interior designer for Broderic Design, tells CNBC Make It. ""The Malm bed is an excellent example of simple rectangular shapes combined to create a very chic bed.""

And ""most of Ikea's furniture is available in black, white, or unfinished wood. By producing more items in fewer finishes, Ikea takes advantage of economy of scale,"" she says.

All this makes Ikea's ""aesthetic per dollar"" ratio very high, says neuromarketer and author of ""The Buying Brain"" Dr. A. K. Pradeep. Ikea's affordable style is its ""category-busting-metric,"" or what makes it stand out from all the other brands in that space, he says.

The brain looks for a single defining characteristic to differentiate among brands, products and services, and if that's not easily identified, the brain falls back to price, says Pradeep, who has worked with companies including Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Pepsi, Subway and Mondelez in the neuromarketing space.
